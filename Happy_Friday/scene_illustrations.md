## Chapter 1: The Sick Day
**Scene:** Nate on the couch in his single-wide trailer, laptop open on his chest with Civilization VI paused, Doritos bag beside him, orange dust on the trackpad. Through the thin blinds behind him, red and blue emergency lights flash silently. The TV screen glows in the dim room. A Sprite and sleeve of Saltines sit on the kitchen counter in the background.
**Characters:** Nate (15, 5'9", 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, round face, brown unkempt hair, white skin, wearing gym shorts and Clarksville Panthers t-shirt two sizes too small, binoculars nearby)

**Mood:** Mundane comfort about to shatter

---

## Chapter 2: The View from the Window
**Scene:** Mr. Pembrook standing motionless in the gravel lot between trailers, facing the sun. Green terrycloth bathrobe hanging open, nothing underneath. Arms at sides. Eyes open but empty. Nate watches through horizontal blinds from his kitchen window, binoculars raised to his eyes. Morning light falls between the trailers in a bright stripe where Pembrook stands.
**Characters:** Mr. Pembrook (60s, balding, retired mail carrier build, green terrycloth bathrobe open, greyish-green discoloration on face and forearms, too-wide grin with too many teeth), Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, Panthers t-shirt, seen from behind at window with binoculars)
**Setting:** Shady Oaks Mobile Home Park, gravel lot between single-wide trailers
**Lighting:** Saturday morning. Bright sunshine between trailers, horizontal blind shadows across Nate's face.
**Mood:** Growing dread. The ordinary made wrong.

---

## Chapter 3: The Thing Mr. Pembrook Did
**Scene:** Lisa Anderson backed against the chain-link fence near the dumpster enclosure, pajama pants and bare feet on cold gravel. Three men form a loose triangle around her — Mr. Pembrook closest, his face wearing that too-wide grin with too many teeth. Lisa's face is beginning to smooth and slacken as the conversion takes hold. Her pajama top slides off one shoulder.
**Characters:** Lisa Anderson (30s, pajama pants, bare feet on gravel, face going blank and smooth), Mr. Pembrook (60s, balding, green terrycloth bathrobe, the wrong grin — too wide, too many teeth, too many muscles), two other men (vacant stare, motionless)
**Setting:** Mobile home park, chain-link fence, dumpster enclosure, gravel
**Lighting:** Late morning sun. Harsh, revealing light.
**Mood:** Horror. The grin as a lure. The moment of conversion.

---

## Chapter 4: The Knock
**Scene:** The closed front door of the trailer, seen from inside. Nate pressed against the wall beside the door, one hand clamped over his mouth, the other hand showing bite marks where he's bitten down to keep from crying out. On the other side of the thin door, a shadow visible through the gap at the bottom. His mother's voice comes through the door.
**Characters:** Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, round face, brown unkempt hair, white skin, gym shorts, Panthers t-shirt, terrified, hand over mouth, bite marks on other hand)
**Setting:** Trailer interior, front door, thin walls, night
**Lighting:** Night. Dim interior lamplight. The crack under the door shows darkness.
**Mood:** Devastating. The organism puppeting his mother's voice through someone else.

---

## Chapter 5: The Playlist
**Scene:** Nate lying face-down under Henderson's trailer, eighteen inches of clearance barely enough to fit, face pressed into mud and dead leaves. Through the lattice skirting he can see bare feet standing motionless on the gravel outside — a row of disheveled random people's legs visible at ground level. His back is bleeding from the vinyl skirting edge. Mud and his own vomit coat his shirt.
**Characters:** Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, Panthers t-shirt covered in mud and vomit, face in mud, bleeding back, terrified stillness), bare feet of multiple disheveled random people visible through skirting
**Setting:** Under a single-wide trailer, eighteen-inch crawl space back pressed against floor of trailer above, dead leaves, mud, lattice skirting
**Lighting:** Daytime but dark under the trailer. Strips of daylight through lattice gaps illuminate the bare feet outside.
**Mood:** Claustrophobic survival. Absolute stillness or death.

---

## Chapter 6: Day Four, or How I Met Sienna
**Scene:** Sienna standing in the kitchen doorway of Nate's trailer, hands raised in a peaceful gesture. Her dark hair pulled back, eyes wide but controlled. Nate faces her holding a spatula defensively, looking ridiculous. Morning light from the back door silhouettes her.
**Characters:** Sienna (17, tall 5'8"-5'10", lean muscular runner's body, tan brown skin, Asian features, black hair in ponytail, wearing track pants and Clarksville Panthers hoodie, canvas sneakers), Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, round face, brown hair, white skin, gym shorts, holding spatula, looking absurd and scared)
**Setting:** Trailer kitchen, narrow space, back door entrance
**Lighting:** Morning. Daylight flooding through the open back door behind Sienna.
**Mood:** First human contact. Relief colliding with fear.

---

## Chapter 7: The Pattern
**Scene:** Nate and Sienna crossing Highway 21 at dawn, moving carefully across empty asphalt toward a small white church. A handwritten cardboard sign on the church door reads "KEEP CALM. COME INSIDE. DON'T RUN." Behind them, a disheveled random person in a Carhartt jacket has turned to watch. The two teenagers move in measured steps, not running.
**Characters:** Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, binoculars around neck, careful steps), Sienna (17, tall, lean athletic, tan brown skin, Asian features, black ponytail, Panthers hoodie, controlled stride), disheveled random person (Carhartt jacket, vacant stare, watching from background)
**Setting:** Empty two-lane highway, small white church with gravel parking lot, rural Arkansas
**Lighting:** Pre-dawn grey turning to dawn. The church is lit by first light.
**Mood:** Terrified hope. Every step measured against death.

---

## Chapter 8: The Church of Whoever's Left
**Scene:** The church basement by candlelight. Seven survivors gathered on metal folding chairs around a table with canned food and a first aid kit. Jim presides with coffee in hand, white hair glowing in candlelight. Ruth sits upright in her cardigan correcting someone's grammar. Dale carves a small wooden beagle. Maria reorganizes canned goods by caloric density. Marcus sits too large for his chair. Sienna and Nate sit together. Candles throw warm shadows on concrete block walls.

**Mood:** Belonging. The first moment of community.

---

## Chapter 9: The Asset
**Scene:** Marcus sitting at a folding table in the church basement, hands on a Cobra 29 CB radio with external antenna. Static hisses from the speaker. The group leans in around him. In one hand he holds a torn logbook page covered in his handwriting — fragments of Dr. Moss's broadcast. His other hand rests near a dead phone, screen dark, lock screen invisible.
**Characters:** Marcus (42, 6'0"-6'2", 220lbs, big truck driver build, broad shoulders, thick arms, white weathered skin, flat weathered expression, jacket, dead phone beside radio, hands always working), group members gathered around listening in background

---

## Chapter 10: The Lyles
**Scene:** Craig Lyle standing on the porch of his fortified two-story house, bullhorn in one hand, rifle slung across his chest. An oversized American flag hangs from the roof gutters. Plywood covers every window. A generator hums visibly. In the background, disheveled random people are beginning to drift toward the house, drawn by the noise. Nate observes through binoculars from a church steeple in the foreground.
**Characters:** Craig Lyle (50s, 6'0", 200lbs, law enforcement build, white skin, sheriff's department jacket, bullhorn in hand, rifle slung across chest), Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, binoculars, foreground looking down from steeple)
**Setting:** Fortified two-story house on a residential street, plywood windows, American flag, generator
**Lighting:** Daytime. Clear autumn light. The flag bright against grey sky.
**Mood:** Doomed confidence. Everything loud, visible, and wrong.

---

## Chapter 11: What the Radio Said
**Scene:** Close on the CB radio speaker, static waves visible as visual texture around it. Marcus hunches over the radio, pencil in hand, writing fragments on a torn logbook page. Behind him the group sits motionless, listening. Through the static, the calm precise voice of Dr. Moss delivers scientific data about an alien organism.
**Characters:** Marcus (42, 6'0"-6'2", 220lbs, big, broad shoulders, white weathered skin, flat expression, jacket, hunched over radio, pencil in hand writing), group silhouettes listening behind him

**Mood:** Revelation. The universe just got larger and more terrifying.

---

## Chapter 12: Nate Tells the Lyles
**Scene:** Nate standing on the Lyles' front porch, small and young against the fortified house. Craig Lyle towers over him, arms crossed, rifle slung, head shaking politely but firmly. The American flag above them. Behind Nate on the sidewalk, Jim and Marcus wait. Through the porch railing, Tammy watches Nate carefully from inside the screen door, a chrysanthemum in a clay pot beside her.
**Characters:** Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, round face, brown hair, white skin, earnest expression, small against the house), Craig Lyle (50s, 6'0", 200lbs, law enforcement build, white skin, sheriff's jacket, arms crossed, rifle slung, polite refusal), Jim (70s, tall 6'1"-6'3", gaunt, white military-short hair, flannel shirt, waiting on sidewalk), Marcus (42, 6'0"-6'2", 220lbs, big, jacket, waiting on sidewalk), Tammy (mid-40s, alert, capable, watching carefully from screen door, chrysanthemum in clay pot beside her)
**Setting:** Lyles' front porch, fortified house, residential street
**Lighting:** Afternoon light. Autumn. Warm but the shadows are long.
**Mood:** Tragic failure of communication. The kid who's right and the man who won't listen.

---

## Chapter 13: The Pharmacy Run
**Scene:** Marcus and Jim moving through an empty small-town street toward a pharmacy, staying low and deliberate. Marcus leads with his bulk, checking corners. Jim follows, one hand on his chest (the heart), the other carrying a canvas bag. On a rooftop far behind them, Nate crouches with binoculars and a walkie-talkie, guiding them. Scattered disheveled random people drift in the background, not yet alerted.
**Characters:** Marcus (42, 6'0"-6'2", 220lbs, big broad shoulders, white weathered skin, jacket, leading, vigilant), Jim (70s, tall 6'1"-6'3", gaunt, white military-short hair, white weathered skin, flannel shirt, hand on chest, canvas bag), Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, on distant rooftop with binoculars and walkie-talkie)
**Setting:** Empty small-town main street, pharmacy storefront, autumn
**Lighting:** Daytime, clear autumn light, long shadows between buildings
**Mood:** High-stakes coordination. Fragile lifeline mission.

---

## Chapter 14: The Septic Tank
**Scene:** Nate crouched in absolute darkness inside a decommissioned septic tank, standing in a foot of waste, the concrete lid above him barely visible. His face is lit only by the faintest crack of light at the lid's edge. Above, the muffled sounds of a swarm frenzy — disheveled random people destroying a house. His eyes are wide, one hand clamped over his nose and mouth, the other braced against the wet wall.
**Characters:** Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, round face, brown hair, white skin, VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL 2019 t-shirt and too-large khakis soaked in waste, alone in darkness, hand over mouth, eyes wide with terror)
**Setting:** Inside a concrete septic tank, standing liquid, darkness, muffled destruction above
**Lighting:** Near total darkness. The thinnest line of light at the lid edge. His face barely visible.
**Mood:** Primal claustrophobic horror. The worst hiding place that saves his life.

---

## Chapter 15: Sienna Runs
**Scene:** Sienna in full sprint down an empty street carrying a six year old boy, her athletic form at maximum extension, her face beginning to smooth and slacken — the conversion starting. Behind her, three disheveled random people pursue. Ahead of her, Jim steps into her path, his fist already drawn back. The moment of impact: Jim's fist connecting with Sienna's jaw, snapping her head sideways, blood and shock breaking the conversion. Her eyes refocusing from blank to human.
**Characters:** Sienna (17, tall 5'8"-5'10", lean muscular runner's body, tan brown skin, Asian features, black ponytail flying, Panthers hoodie, track pants, mid-sprint, face showing placid confused expression, Jim (70s, tall 6'1"-6'3", gaunt large frame, white military-short hair, white weathered skin, flannel shirt, fist connecting with her jaw, grief on his face), three disheveled random people pursuing behind (vacant stare, running)
**Setting:** Residential street, houses with overgrown lawns, autumn
**Lighting:** Afternoon sun. Clear, harsh, everything visible.
**Mood:** Violence as salvation. The hardest punch ever thrown in love.

---

## Chapter 16: The Night the Lyles Fell
**Scene:** The Lyles' fortified house mid-collapse. Plywood torn from windows. The oversized American flag in the mud, trampled, half-buried in plaster dust. The generator a blackened ruin. Dozens of disheveled random people in a frenzy tearing the structure apart — not attacking people, destroying the building itself. Lumber, drywall, roofing scattered. In the foreground, a crushed chrysanthemum in a clay pot under a section of wall framing.
**Characters:** Swarm of disheveled random people (dozens, frenzied, destructive, tearing the building apart), the Lyles absent — already gone
**Setting:** Destroyed two-story house, debris field, residential street, American flag in mud
**Lighting:** Night. The only light is from the burning generator wreckage and distant streetlight glow.
**Mood:** The fortress falls. Everything Craig built becoming rubble.

---

## Chapter 17: Committee Meeting
**Scene:** The church basement, the group around the folding table in candlelight, but the mood has shifted — maps are spread across the table, Marcus's finger pointing at a trail. Faces are serious, drawn. Nate stands at the end of the table rather than sitting. The empty chairs of those who didn't make it. Caleb sits in the corner drawing dinosaurs with crayons, oblivious.
**Characters:** Marcus (42, 6'0"-6'2", 220lbs, big, broad shoulders, jacket, finger on map), Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL 2019 t-shirt, standing, leading despite himself), Jim (70s, tall, gaunt, white military-short hair, flannel, seated, grave), Ruth (72, 5'2", small, white hair, cardigan, sharp-eyed), Dale (40s-50s, lean, hands still, quiet), Maria (40s-50s, practical, calculating expression), Sienna (17, tall, lean athletic, tan brown skin, Asian features, black ponytail, Panthers hoodie, bruise on jaw visible), Caleb (7, small slight build, dark hair, light skin, drawing dinosaurs with crayons in corner)

**Lighting:** Candlelight. Warm but the shadows are deeper now. Tension visible.
**Mood:** The decision to leave. No good options, only the least bad one.

---

## Chapter 18: The Map
**Scene:** A topographic map of the Ozark Highlands Trail fills the foreground, red marker tracing sixty miles from Clarksville to Fayetteville through the Boston Mountains. Marcus's weathered fingers point at elevation contours. Around the map's edges: faces of the group illuminated by lamplight — calculating distances against Ruth's knees and Jim's heart and Caleb's small legs. The trail drawn in red looks like a wound across the mountains.
**Characters:** Marcus (42, big, broad shoulders, white weathered skin, flat expression, weathered hands on map), faces of group around edges — Jim (70s, gaunt, white hair), Ruth (72, small, white hair, sharp eyes), Nate (15, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair), Sienna (17, lean, tan brown skin, black ponytail)
**Setting:** Church basement table, topographic map, red marker
**Lighting:** Single lamp over the map, faces in shadow above
**Mood:** The impossible math of survival. Sixty miles of mountain trail with the old, the young, and the broken.

---

## Chapter 19: The First Mile
**Scene:** The group departing the church at dawn, single file, loaded with packs and supplies. The small white church recedes behind them. Ahead: the tree line of the Ozark National Forest, the trail entrance disappearing into dark woods. Jim leads. Ruth walks slowly, already laboring. Marcus carries extra weight. Caleb rides on Marcus's back. Sienna walks beside Nate at the rear. The last paved road behind them.
**Characters:** Jim (70s, tall 6'1"-6'3", gaunt, white military-short hair, flannel shirt, khakis, pack, leading), Ruth (72, 5'2", 120lbs, small, white hair, cardigan, struggling, slow), Marcus (42, 6'0"-6'2", 220lbs, big broad shoulders, jacket, carrying extra gear and Caleb on his back), Caleb (7, small, dark hair, light skin, on Marcus's back), Dale (40s-50s, lean, casual, mid-group) and Maria (40s-50s, practical, mid-group), Sienna (17, tall, lean athletic, tan brown skin, black ponytail, Panthers hoodie) and Nate (15, 180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL 2019 shirt, khakis, binoculars, rear guard)
**Setting:** Church parking lot transitioning to forest trail entrance, rural Arkansas
**Lighting:** Dawn. Golden-pink light on the church behind them, dark forest ahead.
**Mood:** Commitment. Leaving the last shelter for the unknown.

---

## Chapter 20: The Trail
**Scene:** The group strung out along a narrow ridgeline trail in the Boston Mountains. Bronze and amber oaks frame the path. Far below, a valley is visible through bare hickory branches. Ruth is climbing with Jim supporting her, his hand taking her weight though his own breathing is heavy. Dale walks steadily, hands still. Nate lags behind, thinner than when he started, writing in his notebook as he walks. The trail is steep, rocky, beautiful, and punishing.
**Characters:** Ruth (72, 5'2", 120lbs, small, white hair, cardigan, being helped up rocks, knees grinding), Jim (70s, tall 6'1"-6'3", gaunt, white military-short hair, flannel, supporting Ruth, strained breathing), Dale (40s-50s, lean, steady hands, quiet, walking steadily), Nate (15, ~180lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, khakis looser, notebook in hand, walking and writing), others strung along the trail

**Lighting:** Late October afternoon. Bronze light through autumn canopy. Cold clear air.
**Mood:** Endurance. Beauty and suffering in the same frame.

---

## Chapter 21: The Wolf Knife
**Scene:** A military roadblock on a highway — razor wire stretched across the road, abandoned vehicles, a checkpoint booth. Nate studies it through binoculars from the treeline, calculating. In the middle distance, disheveled random people walk into the razor wire trap, their own frenzy making the wire do the work. The geometry of the trap is visible — the funnel, the wire, the bodies caught in it. Nate's face shows not triumph but horror at his own capacity.
**Characters:** Nate (15, ~170lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, khakis, binoculars, in treeline, face showing moral revulsion at what he understands), disheveled random people caught in razor wire in middle distance (vacant stare, frenzied, tangled in wire)
**Setting:** Highway roadblock, razor wire, abandoned military vehicles, autumn forest edge
**Lighting:** Overcast daylight. Grey, flat, revealing everything without mercy.
**Mood:** The wolf knife — the organism's frenzy turned against itself. Effective and sickening.

---

## Chapter 22: Mom
**Scene:** Nate collapsed on his knees on a highway, hands flat on the asphalt. In the distance behind him, barely visible, a cluster of disheveled random people near a hospital — among them, a woman in blue scrubs with a familiar build and familiar hair in a ponytail. Nate's face is destroyed with grief. His blood pressure cuff is on his wrist, numbers climbing. Sienna stands a few feet away, wanting to reach for him but not touching him. The highway stretches empty in both directions.
**Characters:** Nate (15, ~170lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, khakis, on knees, shattered with grief, blood pressure cuff on wrist), Sienna (17, tall 5'8"-5'10", lean athletic, tan brown skin, Asian features, black ponytail, Panthers hoodie, standing near, reaching but not touching, anguished), Delia Carver in distance (40s, ponytail, Caucasian white skin, blue scrubs, barely visible among cluster of disheveled random people near hospital)
**Setting:** Empty highway, hospital visible in distance, flat Arkansas landscape
**Lighting:** Overcast. Grey November afternoon. Flat, colorless, merciless light.
**Mood:** The moment hope dies. The confirmation he's been dreading.

---

## Chapter 23: Nate Walks
**Scene:** Nate walking alone on a road heading north, seen from behind. His figure is small against the empty landscape — the road stretching ahead, treeline on both sides, sky low and grey. His pack is on, his notebook visible in one hand. He's not running. Just walking away. Far behind him, barely visible, Sienna follows at a distance, not calling out, just tracking him.
**Characters:** Nate (15, ~170lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, khakis, pack, notebook in hand, from behind, diminished, walking alone), Sienna (17, tall, lean athletic, tan brown skin, black ponytail, Panthers hoodie, far behind, small figure following on the road)
**Setting:** Empty rural road, treeline, overcast sky, flat landscape
**Lighting:** Late afternoon, grey. The figures cast no shadows.
**Mood:** Grief made physical. A boy trying to walk away from his own survival.

---

## Chapter 24: What Dale Learned
**Scene:** Dale sitting by a campfire on the trail at night, carving a small wooden figure by firelight.  The wooden beagle takes shape under his knife. Around him the group sleeps in bedrolls. Caleb sleeps with the finished wooden beagle clutched to his chest nearby. Dale's face shows something beyond pain — the hard-won peace of someone who survived by accepting rather than fighting.
**Characters:** Dale (40s-50s, 5'10", 160lbs, lean, quiet watchful expression, steady hands with carving knife, firelit face, peaceful expression, casual clothes), Caleb (7, small slight build, dark hair, light skin, asleep clutching wooden beagle to chest), sleeping adults in background bedrolls
**Setting:** Trail campsite, campfire, bedrolls, dark forest surrounding
**Lighting:** Campfire only. Warm orange on Dale's hands and face, darkness beyond.
**Mood:** Hard-won peace. The moment recovery becomes real.

---

## Chapter 25: The Herd
**Scene:** The group on a hilltop overlook, looking down into the valley of Fayetteville. Below them: hundreds of rooted disheveled random people standing motionless in the sun, nude, feet embedded in soil, connected by dark vine-like root structures threading between them across the ground. A forest of human-shaped trees. Street cuts through the field of rooted like a dark line of pavement.
**Characters:** Nate (15, ~165lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, khakis, binoculars studying the valley), the group behind him on the overlook — Sienna (17, tall, lean, tan brown skin, black ponytail), Jim (70s, tall gaunt, white hair), Marcus (42, big), Ruth (72, small), Dale, Maria, Caleb (7, small, on someone's shoulders). Below: hundreds of rooted disheveled random people (nude, pale grey-green skin, motionless, feet embedded in earth, connected by dark vine-like root structures across ground)
**Setting:** Hilltop overlook above Fayetteville valley, commercial district visible, Dixon Street cutting through rooted field
**Lighting:** Midday sun. The rooted face the light. Their grey-green skin catches the sun.
**Mood:** Cosmic horror and awe. Not a herd — a colony. A networked organism.

---

## Chapter 26: The Frequency
**Scene:** Dr. Eleanor Moss at a whiteboard in a university seminar room, drawing diagrams of alien cell structures with a dry-erase marker. The group sits in tiered seating, exhausted and trail-worn, watching her lecture. Behind her on the wall: a printout of comet orbital data with circled dates. Howard mops the hallway visible through the doorway.

**Mood:** Revelation. Science confronting the alien. The organism explained.

---

## Chapter 27: The Archive
**Scene:** Nate handing his stained, wrinkled notebook across a desk to Dr. Moss. She takes it with both hands. Behind her: a cluttered office with printouts, specimen jars, and a periodic table poster with hand-drawn sad faces over exhausted element stocks. The comet printout is on the wall. Nate's hands are ink-stained. The notebook is thick with six weeks of observations, water-stained, mud-edged, pages curling.
**Characters:** Nate (15, ~165lbs, fat, overweight, soft, brown hair, white skin, ink-stained fingers, trail-worn khakis, hands extending notebook), Dr. Moss (30, thin, short black hair, glasses, sharp tired eyes, permanent squint, lab coat over flannel and jeans, receiving notebook with both hands)

## Chapter 30: The Journal
**Scene:** Nate sitting alone on the roof of the science building at dusk, writing in a new notebook. The frequency emitter's antenna array is visible behind him on the parapet. Below, the campus is quiet. Beyond the campus, the ring of rooted disheveled random people stretches to the horizon — hundreds of grey-green figures in the fading light, root networks visible as dark webs on the ground. The sky is orange and purple. Nate writes. The world has changed but the boy on the roof keeps writing.
**Characters:** Nate (15, ~165lbs, fat, overweight, soft, older-looking than chapter 1, sharper face, brown hair, white skin, khakis trail-worn and looser, alone on rooftop, writing in notebook, silhouetted against sunset, binoculars around neck, ink-stained fingers)
**Setting:** Science building rooftop, antenna array, campus below, rooted disheveled random people ring at perimeter, vast landscape beyond
