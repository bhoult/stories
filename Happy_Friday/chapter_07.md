# Chapter 7: The Pattern

We crossed Highway 21 at 7:15 AM on a Tuesday in October, which is not a sentence I expected to describe as the bravest thing I'd ever done.

Sienna had lain on the couch with her shoes on and her eyes open, watching the ceiling, while I took the hallway floor again because the hallway was the spot I'd claimed through repeated misery and at this point it felt like territory. I'd given her the blanket from my mom's bed. She didn't argue. Athletes know when to conserve.

I was wearing my only clean clothes — a pair of gym shorts and a Clarksville Panthers t-shirt two sizes too small that my mom had bought at a school fundraiser. Everything else I owned was in a garbage bag by the back door: the jeans and hoodie from the night under Henderson's trailer, still stiff with dried mud and vomit and whatever else had soaked into them from the ground. I'd tried to wash them in the sink. The stains faded but didn't leave. The smell faded but didn't leave. I threw them away eventually. Some things don't come clean.

Two hundred yards. My back door to Jim's church. In the old world, four minutes. We stood at the back door and breathed. Sienna counted — four in, hold four, out six — her voice doing more for my heart rate than any technique I'd read about. My hand throbbed in its sock bandage. The fever was low but present, a warmth behind my eyes that made everything slightly unreal.

"Ready?" she said.

"No."

"Good. Honest people live longer." She opened the door.

The park was quiet in the pre-dawn grey. Six Turned visible. Pembrook in his usual spot, face tilted toward the eastern horizon. The discoloration on his skin was darker than two days ago — the greyish-green spreading down his forearms. My first thought was decomposition — that the Turned were rotting on their feet and would eventually fall apart. The zombie-movie version. But Pembrook wasn't decaying. He was eating and drinking and sorting garbage with purpose. Whatever was happening to his skin was something else — changing, progressing toward something I couldn't identify.

We moved. Slow. Measured. Sienna moved better than I did — lighter, more coordinated, her feet finding the quieter spots between stones. I moved like what I was: a hundred and eighty pounds of anxiety impersonating nonchalance. Each crunch of gravel sent a jolt through me that I had to manually override, and at one point Sienna's hand touched my elbow — a brief pressure — and the spiral broke. I was focused on survival. I was thinking about gravel.

A Turned man in an open Carhartt jacket — bare chest catching the dawn light — took two steps toward us and stopped. Head cocked, like a dog hearing a frequency it can't place. Ten seconds. Then he turned away.

We reached Highway 21. Asphalt empty in both directions. Crossed. Past the church parking lot I could see the sign — hand-lettered on cardboard, propped in the side window, angled toward the road. Block letters in black marker:

**KEEP CALM. COME INSIDE. DON'T RUN.**

Jim had placed it to be visible from the road. He'd thought about the angle, the letter size, the window height — placed it the way you place a lighthouse, to catch people at the moment they most need direction. I don't know how many people that sign saved. I know it saved us, and I hadn't even consciously registered reading it from the trailer park until this moment, standing in the parking lot, seeing it from the intended distance.

The side door opened before we reached it. Jim Whittaker — big man gone thin, late sixties, white hair cropped military-short, flannel and khakis — held the door open and didn't speak until we were inside and the bolt was thrown.

"Delia's boy," he said. "And the Okafor girl. Took you long enough."

The bolt clicked home. The sound of a lock engaging had never meant more.
