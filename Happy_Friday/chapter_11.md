# Chapter 11: What the Radio Said

On Day 12, Dr. Moss gave us a longer broadcast.

Marcus had been working the CB every evening, scanning Channel 21, catching fragments. Most were static. Some were repetitions of things we'd already heard — the endocrine mechanism, the beta-blocker protocol. But on this evening, the atmospheric conditions aligned or her transmitter was running better or whatever variables govern radio propagation decided to cooperate, and we got twelve unbroken minutes.

Everyone gathered in the basement. Jim in his chair. Ruth on a folding chair with her novel closed on her lap. Dale carving — he'd finished the beagle and was starting something new, a bird of some kind, though it was too early to tell what species. Maria standing by the pantry closet with her arms crossed. Sienna sitting on the floor with her back against the wall, legs extended, the posture of an athlete at rest — which still looked more alert than most people standing up. And me, at the table, with the notebook open and a pen in my hand, writing as fast as I could.

The static thinned and Dr. Moss's voice came through, clearer than we'd ever heard it.

"— repeat this broadcast daily for any survivors in the northwest Arkansas region. My name is Dr. Eleanor Moss. I am a research biologist at the University of Arkansas. I am broadcasting from the life sciences building on campus. This facility has generator power, laboratory equipment, and supplies sufficient for an extended period."

She paused. I could hear her turning a page.

"I want to address a misconception that may be costing lives. Many survivor groups have adopted a fortification strategy — boarding windows, arming perimeters, concentrating in defensible positions. This strategy is counterproductive. The organism's collective behavior is drawn to human activity. Noise, light, electromagnetic output, and particularly the biochemical signatures of stress — all of these attract the Turned. Fortification concentrates these signals. Every defended position I have observed or received reports about has followed the same trajectory: the defenses attract Turned, the Turned accumulate, and when the local density exceeds a critical threshold — what I'm calling the density threshold — the collective behavior destabilizes."

She said this the way you'd describe a chemical reaction — factual, measured, the voice of a scientist reading from data.

"Below the threshold, the Turned exhibit patient herding behavior. Targeted social manipulation. Voice mimicry. They are coordinated, strategic, and nonviolent. Above the threshold, the coordination collapses into undirected destruction. The patient predator becomes a demolition event. The threshold varies — I do not yet have reliable numbers, and I want to stress that I do not have reliable numbers, because giving you a number that's wrong could get you killed. What I can tell you is that the threshold appears to depend on spatial density, not raw count. Thirty Turned spread across a square mile are below threshold. Thirty in a parking lot may not be."

I was writing as fast as I could. Sienna was watching me write. Marcus had his hand on the radio as if physical contact could hold the signal steady.

"The implications for survival are these: stay small. Stay quiet. Do not concentrate. Do not fortify. Do not engage. If you are receiving this and you are alive, it is because your biochemistry is below the activation threshold. Do not do anything that raises it. Every fortress is a countdown. Every act of defense is an invitation."

Static intruded for a few seconds. Then she came back, and her voice had shifted — less clinical, more human, as if she'd looked up from her notes and was speaking directly to whoever was listening.

"There is more to communicate. The organism's adaptation rate is accelerating. The Turned I observe on campus are more coordinated, more efficient, and more physically resilient than the Turned from week one. This is not a static threat. It is improving. I have data on this — spectrographic analysis, behavioral timelines — that I cannot transmit by radio. If you can reach this facility, I can share what I know. And what I know may — I want to be careful about promising — may include countermeasures."

A pause.

"If you are hearing this and you are weighing whether to move: the risk of staying increases every day. The risk of moving can be managed. I recommend low-density routes. Avoid highways, interchanges, and urban corridors. The Ozark National Forest is largely depopulated. The ridgeline trails offer —"

Static swallowed her. The signal broke. Marcus adjusted the antenna, scanned, found nothing. Channel 21 was empty.

---

The basement was quiet for a long time.

Jim broke it. "She didn't mention God."

"She's a scientist," I said.

"I noticed." He wasn't offended. He was noting a gap — something missing from her framework, the way a builder checks for a foundation. "Scientists describe what's happening. They don't always describe what it means."

"Maybe what it means is what's happening. Maybe there isn't a layer underneath."

"Maybe." He didn't argue. He folded his hands. "Or maybe the layer underneath is the part she hasn't found yet."

Marcus capped his flask. "The density threshold. She said it varies. She doesn't have numbers."

"I've been counting," I said. "The Walmart cluster hit twenty-five and I saw behavioral changes — twitchiness, agitation. The Lyles have maybe twenty in their perimeter and they're stable so far, but the count is growing. If it's about spatial density, not raw numbers..."

"Then the Lyles' property — what, quarter acre? — is a tighter space than the Walmart parking lot. The threshold would be lower."

"Yes."

"How much lower?"

"I don't know. She doesn't know. That's the problem — the most important number is the one nobody can give us, and if we guess wrong, the Lyles' house comes apart."

---

Dale's knife had stopped moving.

This was notable because Dale's knife never stopped moving. In the ten days I'd known him, his hands had been in constant motion — carving, whittling, shaping. The beagle. The bird. Small abstract things he didn't name. The motion kept his brain from spinning into the places it went when it was idle.

The knife was still.

"She said the organism is adapting," he said. "Getting more efficient."

"Yes."

"Does that mean it adapts to medication? Does it — does it learn to work around the Suboxone?"

The question hung in the air. I looked at Dale and saw terror behind it — the specific terror of a man whose survival depends on a molecule and who has just been told that the thing he's surviving against is learning.

"I don't know," I said. This was the truth. "She didn't say that specifically. She said the Turned's behavior is adapting. That could mean the organism is getting better at operating human bodies. It doesn't necessarily mean it's overcoming pharmaceutical suppression."

"But it could."

"It could."

Dale picked up the knife. Started carving again. The strokes were tighter, faster, removing more material than necessary. He was making a new shape and he was making it angry.

Maria, from the pantry closet, said: "How much Suboxone do we have?"

"Eighteen days," Dale said. Without looking up. He'd been counting. Of course he'd been counting.

"The pharmacy run got beta-blockers for Jim and Ruth. Did it get Suboxone?"

"Suboxone isn't behind the counter at a small-town pharmacy," Dale said. "It's prescribed through clinics. Controlled distribution. The nearest clinic was in Fort Smith and Fort Smith is —" He didn't finish. Fort Smith was forty miles west on I-40, through exactly the kind of urban corridor that Moss had just told us to avoid.

"Eighteen days," Maria said. She was doing math. I could see her doing it — resources in, resources out, time to zero. "And then what?"

Dale didn't answer. His knife moved. The wood curled.

"And then I find out whether twelve years of sobriety and six months of yoga are enough to keep my nervous system below whatever the line is." He looked up. His eyes were flat. "I'll let you know."

---

That evening nobody wanted to be alone and nobody wanted to talk about what Moss had said, so we didn't. Jim made coffee — the last of the good grounds, not the instant — and didn't apologize for the extravagance. Ruth read aloud from her romance novel, not because anyone asked but because the silence needed filling, and she chose to fill it with a scene involving a Scottish duke and an heiress and a misunderstanding about a horse, and it was so absurdly, magnificently irrelevant that we all just listened. Maria corrected a plot point. Dale said the horse breed was wrong. Marcus said he'd driven through Scotland once and the roads were terrible. These observations had nothing to do with anything and that was the entire point.

Sienna was sitting on the floor near the stairs, stretching — a habit from her old life that she maintained the way Dale maintained his carving, a way of telling her body it still existed for a reason. At one point she caught my eye and made a face — a small, private expression that meant *this is ridiculous and I'm grateful for it* — and I made a face back that meant approximately the same thing, and the exchange lasted half a second and contained more communication than anything I'd written in the notebook all week.

We didn't solve anything that evening. We didn't plan or strategize or calculate. We just occupied the same room and let the room be enough. I am recording this because the journal is supposed to be a survival document, and this was survival — the kind where you remind yourself that the people around you are people and not just assets on a board.

Marcus broke the quiet. He was sitting on his pew, back against the wall, flask between his knees.

"Question," he said. "Serious one."

Jim looked up from his Bible.

"Has anyone tried killing one?"

The room changed. Ruth's novel lowered an inch. Dale's knife paused mid-stroke. Maria's head turned from the pantry like a radar dish acquiring a target.

"Killing," Jim said. The word sat in his mouth like a stone.

"They stand in the parking lot. They don't move. They don't dodge. Somebody walks up with a hatchet, hits one in the head — what happens? Does it die?"

"They're people, Marcus."

"They're standing in a parking lot in the rain using dead people's voices to scare other people into joining them. That's not people behavior, Jim. That's predator behavior wearing a people costume."

Dale's knife moved again — one slow stroke. "What if they feel it?"

Marcus looked at him. "What if they do? Isn't that worse? Being trapped inside something that uses your body to hurt people you love — isn't that the thing that's worse than dying?"

Nobody had an answer for that. Jim's mouth opened and closed. Ruth's novel went back up, but her eyes weren't tracking the page.

"We don't know enough," I said. "We don't know if they can be killed — Moss said they're physically resilient, the organism maintains the host. We don't know if killing one triggers a response from the others. Ignorance should stop us before morality does."

"Morality's the thing that should stop us first," Jim said. Quiet. Certain.

"Then morality and ignorance are on the same side for once," I said. "We don't kill what we don't understand."

Marcus capped his flask. "I'm not saying we should. I'm asking if anyone's tried." He looked around the room. "Because if nobody's tried, then nobody knows. And 'nobody knows' is a hell of a thing to bet your life on."

The question hung in the basement like smoke. Nobody answered it. Nobody put it away, either.

That night Marcus woke the basement.

It wasn't a scream — it was a name, pulled out of him like something physical. "Ava!" — sharp, desperate, a man reaching for something in the dark and finding nothing. By the time I was fully awake he was sitting up on his pew, hands on his knees, breathing hard. The room was quiet. Ruth had her eyes open. Dale, on the nearest pew, hadn't moved, but his voice came through the dark, low and even.

"I dream about the highway too," Dale said.

Marcus said nothing. After a minute his breathing slowed. He lay back down. The dark settled over us again.

In the morning nobody mentioned it. But the silence was different — the silence of people who'd all been awake in the dark thinking the same thing and waiting for someone else to say it.

I said it. Over breakfast — the cold oatmeal, Ruth's insistence — I said: "What happens if someone turns from a nightmare?"

The oatmeal got very quiet.

"The mechanism is fear," I said. "Adrenaline, cortisol, sustained sympathetic activation. Nightmares produce all of those. We're sleeping six feet apart in a basement. If someone crosses the threshold in their sleep —"

"They wake up Turned," Dale said. His voice was flat. He wasn't speculating. He was running the scenario the way a man in recovery runs relapse scenarios — not *if* but *when.*

"Would we know?" Ruth asked. Her hands were steady on her coffee mug but her knuckles were white. "If someone turned in their sleep. Would we know immediately, or would they — would the organism —"

"Mimic," I said. "The organism mimics. That's what herding *is.* It uses the host's voice, the host's face. If someone turned in the dark, alone, among sleepers —" I stopped. The image was there: one of us, lying still, eyes open in the dark, the grin spreading, listening to the others breathe. Using our names. *Hey, you okay?* in a voice you'd been trusting for two weeks. "We might not know until it was too late."

The basement was very still.

Maria spoke first. "We post a watch. One person awake, all night, watching the others sleep."

"Watching for what?" Dale said. "The smile? Heart rate? How do you tell the difference between a nightmare and a conversion when both look like someone thrashing in the dark?"

"Blood pressure cuff," I said. "Mine reads continuously. If someone spikes above threshold —"

"One cuff for seven people. And the person wearing it is the one you're monitoring, not the six you aren't."

Jim had been listening with his hands folded, organizing something in his head before releasing it. "We post a watch," he said. "Not to monitor. To *be there.* One person awake, watching the sleepers. Not because we can prevent a turning — we probably can't. But because if it happens, someone is awake to respond. To wake the others. To get people out."

Ruth set her mug down. "You're asking us to watch each other the way we watch *them.*"

"I'm asking us to love each other enough to stay awake."

Dale's knife was moving — fast, sharp strokes. "I'll sleep separated. Upstairs. Away from the group."

"Dale —"

"My withdrawal spikes in the early morning. Three, four AM. That's when my cortisol peaks. If anyone in this room is going to turn from a nightmare, it's me, and I'd rather be upstairs alone than downstairs among people I —" He stopped cutting. "People I don't want to hurt."

"Nobody is sleeping alone," Jim said. "That's not how we do this."

"Then how do we do this?" Marcus asked. He'd been quiet since the nightmare, the name still sitting in the air between us. "Because the kid's right. We're all dreaming bad. We're all spiking. And if someone turns —" He looked at me. "What do we do? Hold them down? Lock them in a room? Kill them?"

Nobody answered. The word *kill* sat on the table like something physical.

"We don't have to solve all of it today," Jim said. "We solve the first part. Watch rotation. Two-hour shifts. One person awake with a flashlight, watching the room. If someone spikes — thrashing, the sounds we know — the watcher wakes me. We assess together."

"And if the assessment is bad?" Maria asked.

"Then we deal with it. Together. In the light."

We set up the rotation that morning. Two-hour shifts, midnight to six. Jim took the first slot. Marcus took second. I took third. Dale insisted on fourth — the pre-dawn hours, his worst window, arguing that if he was going to be awake sweating through cortisol spikes anyway, he might as well be useful.

I wrote it in the notebook: *We are now watching ourselves the way we watch the Turned. The perimeter is inside the room.*

And separately: *Marcus dreams about Ava. The phone screen going dark. Three days in the cab with nothing but bourbon and a dead phone and the sound of Turned walking past the windows. He carries the dream the way he carries the phone — something broken he won't put down.*

---

I went up to the steeple after the broadcast. I needed to think, and thinking happened better with the binoculars and the long view — the park, the road, the Lyles' compound to the north, the Walmart across the interstate to the south. The October sun was low, casting long shadows across the parking lot. The Turned stood in their positions, faces angled toward the light.

Jim came up the stairs about twenty minutes later. He didn't say anything at first — just stood at the louvers, looking out at the parking lot with the expression of a man conducting a service for people who couldn't hear him.

"Tom Hadley," he said, pointing. "Third from the left. The one by the utility pole."

I found him through the binoculars. A heavyset man in a flannel shirt, face tilted toward the sun, the standard posture. Nothing distinctive.

"He directed the choir," Jim said. "Twenty-two years. Every Sunday, Wednesday rehearsal, Christmas cantata. He had this thing he did" — Jim raised his right hand, fingers together, making a small scooping motion — "when the sopranos came in. Like he was pulling the sound out of the air."

I looked again. Tom Hadley's hands were at his sides. Then — so subtle I would have missed it without the binoculars — his right hand moved. Fingers together, a small scooping motion, the ghost of a cue to singers who would never sing again. The motion lasted two seconds. Then his hand dropped and he was still.

"That's not the organism," Jim said. "The organism doesn't know how to conduct a choir. That's Tom."

I lowered the binoculars. Jim was watching Hadley the way a father watches a sleeping child — with tenderness and with the specific grief of seeing someone present and unreachable at the same time.

"Marcus asked if we could kill them," I said.

"I heard."

"If Tom's still in there — if the person persists inside the host — then killing the Turned isn't pest control. It's something else."

"It's murder," Jim said. Simply. Not arguing. Naming.

"Or mercy."

"Maybe. But we don't get to decide that from a steeple with binoculars. We don't get to decide that without knowing what he feels, if he feels, whether the Tom doing the scooping motion is a person trapped or a recording playing back. And since we can't know —"

"We don't act."

"We don't act *yet.*" He looked at me. "I'm not saying never. I'm saying not from ignorance. Not from convenience. If we ever do that — if we ever cross that line — it has to be because we understand what we're ending. Not because it's easier than understanding."

He went back downstairs. I stayed in the steeple and watched Tom Hadley conduct his empty choir, and I didn't know which possibility unsettled me more — that he was still in there, or that he wasn't and the organism was borrowing his hands for a purpose I couldn't fathom.

I was revising assumptions. You observe. You form a model. The model predicts behavior. When the behavior deviates, you revise. You don't get attached to the model. You let it be wrong and you build a better one.

My first model: the Turned are dangerous because they herd you and scare you and the fear turns you. This was true but incomplete.

My second model: the danger is biochemical, not behavioral. Keep your adrenaline down and you're invisible. Also true. Also incomplete.

The new model, after Moss's broadcast and Sienna's report from the blockade: the danger is *layered.* Layer one is the herding — the fear-farming, the conversion cycle. We'd learned to counter that. Layer two is the density threshold — the swarm behavior that makes them destructive. We couldn't counter that; we could only avoid it. Layer three — the one that scared me most — was the hunger. Sienna had seen them eating the dead at the interchange. When the easy food ran out, the Turned would expand their search. They wouldn't need to scare you to kill you. They'd just need to find you.

And underneath all three layers was the thing Moss had described without dwelling on: the organism was adapting. Getting better. The Turned from week one were clumsy, degrading, barely functional. The Turned from week two were coordinated, strategic, increasingly efficient. If the trajectory continued — and why wouldn't it — the Turned from week four or six or eight would be something we hadn't seen yet and couldn't predict.

Every model I built had a shelf life. Every answer was temporary. The organism was iterating faster than my understanding.

I thought about something I'd read in a Wikipedia article about evolution — not in the textbook, just one of those 2 AM deep dives where you start with "how fast do bacteria evolve" and end up reading about the Red Queen hypothesis. The idea is simple: in an evolutionary arms race, you have to keep running just to stay in the same place. The organism adapts, so you adapt, so it adapts again, and the race never ends. Lewis Carroll's Red Queen, telling Alice: "It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."

We were in a Red Queen race and we were losing. Not because we weren't adapting — we were. But our adaptation was cognitive, social, slow. The organism's adaptation was biological, collective, fast. We were playing chess against something that was rewriting the rules between moves.

The sun went down. The Turned shifted. Sixteen faces turned toward the last of the light. Pembrook's skin, in the steeple binoculars, was visibly green now — not the grey-green of week one but a darker, almost vegetal shade, concentrated on his face and forearms. The sun-exposed surfaces. I wrote it in the notebook and drew an arrow connecting it to the sunflower observation from week one and didn't write what I thought it meant because I wasn't ready.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #6:**

*Day 12. Moss confirmed the density threshold. Confirmed adaptation. She has more data but can't transmit it. She's sixty miles away and she's the only person I know of who's studying this systematically.*

*Dale has eighteen days of Suboxone. Jim has maybe forty days of metoprolol at current dose. Ruth has twenty-five days of atenolol. The pharmacy run bought time, not a solution. When the medications run out, the people who are alive because of chemistry will have to survive on willpower. And willpower doesn't come in milligrams.*

*The old model said: stay calm and you're safe. The new model says: stay calm, stay below the density threshold, stay fed, stay medicated, and outrun an organism that's adapting faster than you are. "Safe" was always temporary.*

*I'm starting to think the whole concept of "rules for survival" is a comfort blanket. The rules keep changing. The organism keeps learning. The only real rule is: pay attention. Revise. Don't get attached to being right.*

*Moss said "every fortress is a countdown." She's right. But what she didn't say is that every model is a countdown too.*
