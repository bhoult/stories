# Chapter 19: The First Mile

The Ozark Highlands Trail does not believe in flat.

We rode bicycles to the trailhead. Eight people on eight bikes, pedaling twenty miles of two-lane blacktop through the Ozark foothills, packs strapped to rear racks and handlebars and, in my case, balanced on my lap like a pregnant belly made of nylon and poor decisions. Ruth and Jim had the e-bikes — Ruth because her knees couldn't pedal twenty miles, Jim because he was seventy-three and nobody argued with Ruth about getting one so nobody could argue with Jim either. Caleb rode on Marcus's handlebars, gripping the crossbar with both hands, the wooden beagle in his jacket pocket bumping against the frame.

The road was empty. Three weeks of no traffic and the pavement was already changing — leaves in the gutters, a branch down in the right lane, the first cracks where tree roots were starting to reclaim what asphalt had borrowed. We passed houses. Some had Turned in the yards — the head-turns tracked us as we pedaled past, the smiles following, but bikes were fast enough that none of them transitioned beyond passive interest. We passed Clarksville's city limit sign and the Dollar General and the shuttered Sonic Drive-In and the world we were leaving behind.

We reached the trailhead at midday — a gravel parking area off Forest Service Road 1003. The parking area was empty. No cars, no Turned. The first good sign in three weeks.

We leaned the bikes against a split-rail fence at the edge of the lot. Eight bicycles, two of them still showing a charge on their battery indicators. Machines we'd never use again. Marcus looked at them for a moment — the particular look of a man who'd spent his life around vehicles, who understood the value of anything with wheels — and then turned away. We were leaving the world of wheels. Everything after this was feet.

The trailhead marker was a brown post with a white blaze — an aluminum diamond nailed to the wood, catching the November light. Beyond it, the trail entered the forest like a thread being pulled into fabric: a two-foot-wide path of packed earth and leaf litter, climbing immediately, switchbacking up a hardwood hollow toward a sandstone ridge that was invisible from below.

"That's up," Caleb said. He was holding Dale's hand. Dale had given him the beagle to carry in his jacket pocket and Caleb had his other hand on the beagle and he was looking at the trail the way a seven-year-old looks at something that is clearly, obviously, unfairly tall.

"That's up," Marcus confirmed.

"All of it?"

"Most of it."

Caleb looked at me. I don't know why he looked at me — maybe because I was the biggest person who also clearly didn't want to walk uphill, and solidarity with the reluctant is comforting at any age.

"I don't want to," he said.

"Me neither, buddy. Let's go."

---

The first mile climbed six hundred feet. I know this because I asked Marcus. I'm the kind of person who wants to quantify suffering, as if knowing the exact gradient will make my lungs burn less. It does not.

Oak leaves covered the trail — ankle-deep, dry, hiding every root and rock beneath them. The path switchbacked up the hollow in tight turns, gaining elevation through a forest of white oaks and hickories that were shedding their canopy in sheets of bronze and amber. The leaves crunched under eight pairs of feet. Below us, through the thinning trees, the lowland we'd left fell away into haze.

The order of march: Marcus in front, because he'd crossed these ridgelines by road and had the best instinct for terrain. Then Sienna, setting pace, her stride shortened to match Ruth's but still fluid, still the athlete's economy — and she kept bouncing on her toes when the group stopped, stretching her calves against rocks, the runner's body idling at a speed it found insulting. Then Jim and Ruth, side by side, Jim's hand occasionally steadying Ruth's elbow on the steeper grades. Then Dale and Caleb, Dale's knife out and a piece of wood in his other hand, carving as he walked, the shavings falling behind him like breadcrumbs. Then Maria, who walked with the precise, metronomic pace of a woman who had decided that sixty miles was a logistical problem and was solving it one step at a time.

Then me.

I was last because I was slowest. Physics. A hundred and eighty pounds going uphill on legs that had never climbed anything steeper than the stairs to the school library, with thirty-two pounds of pack shifting on my back like a drunk passenger. The hip belt dug into the tops of my hip bones — a grinding pressure that started as discomfort and became pain within the first half mile. The shoulder straps pulled backward, hauling at my collarbones, making me lean forward on the uphills until my center of gravity was somewhere in front of my knees and every step felt like catching a fall. My back was soaked. The pack trapped heat against my spine and the sweat had nowhere to go and by the second switchback my shirt was plastered to my skin and the shirt was rubbing against the pack frame in a way that would, by nightfall, produce a raw stripe across both shoulder blades that would hurt for five days.

By the first switchback I was breathing hard. By the second I was sweating through my shirt despite the cold. By the third I was making sounds that were technically breathing but sounded more like a large animal being slowly inflated. And somewhere around the third switchback my inner thighs began to chafe — the fabric of my jeans, damp with sweat, grinding against skin with every step, a specific humiliation I was not going to mention to anyone, least of all Sienna, who was walking thirty yards ahead with the easy stride of a person whose body was designed for this.

I threw up on the fourth switchback. Just leaned over, hands on knees — the pack nearly tipping me forward onto my face — and threw up my breakfast onto the leaves beside the trail. Sienna glanced back. She didn't stop. She didn't comment. She looked, assessed that I wasn't dying, and kept walking.

This was the nicest thing she'd ever done for me.

I kept walking. The anger wouldn't let me stop. The anger I'd brought from Clarksville — the hospital parking lot, the laps around the church — was the only engine I had that didn't require oxygen. My lungs burned. My legs screamed. The anger said: *good. You earned this. You sat at a window while Lisa Anderson was taken. You sat in a basement while your mother stood in a parking lot with bare feet. The pain is what you owe.* And the pain became something I leaned into rather than something I endured, and the leaning-in looked like grit but it wasn't grit, it was punishment, and the punishment kept me moving when grit would have let me sit down.

Somewhere on the fifth switchback, Sienna dropped back. She'd been thirty yards ahead, setting pace, but now she was beside me, matching my labored stride.

"Hey," she said. "You okay?"

"Fine." I was not fine. I was covered in sweat and vomit residue and the inside of my thighs felt like they'd been rubbed with sandpaper and I was furious at everything that existed.

"You've got that look."

"What look."

"The one where you're three zip codes deep in your own head and you forgot to leave a forwarding address." She bumped her shoulder against my arm — a light contact, almost playful. Different from the fierce girl who'd walked laps with me at the church. Softer. "Talk to me."

"Nothing to talk about."

She studied me for a moment — the assessing look, the one I recognized from her reprimand speech, except this time it was gentler, searching rather than challenging. She didn't find what she was looking for.

"Okay," she said. She dropped back to her pace position. The trail went up. I followed.

Ruth was slow. Her knees ground audibly on the steep sections, a sound like sand in a joint. Jim stayed with her, matching her pace exactly, his hand appearing at her elbow on the switchbacks and disappearing on the straights, the automatic choreography of a man who had spent a career walking beside people who needed him.

Caleb fell twice. The first time he tripped on a root hidden under leaves and went down hard, skinning both palms. He cried — briefly, sharply, the cry of a child who is hurt but not broken — and Dale picked him up and brushed the leaves off and said "What do we do when we fall?" and Caleb, still sniffling, said "Get up" and Dale said "That's right" and they kept walking. The second time was on a rock scramble near the ridgeline where the trail crossed exposed sandstone. Caleb's shoe slipped and he slid three feet before Marcus caught him — one hand, casual, the reflexes of a man who'd been catching things that slid for twenty years.

Between falls, Caleb walked. He had the wooden zoo in his jacket pockets — the beagle, the cardinal, the fox — and in his right hand, held carefully, the three wooden chickens Dale had carved the night before. He talked to them. Not loudly, not performing — the quiet, serious monologue of a child explaining the world to something that needed explaining to.

"This part is up," he told them. "But then it goes down. You have to hold on."

A switchback later: "Steggy doesn't like rocks. Rex is okay with rocks. Triceratops doesn't care."

He assigned them personalities. Steggy was scared of heights. Rex was brave but got tired. Triceratops was the leader because she was the fattest and fat meant wise, according to a logic system I couldn't penetrate but respected entirely. When the trail leveled out and Caleb could walk without watching his feet, he lined them up on his palm and had them discuss the view.

"It's very big," Triceratops said, in Caleb's voice. "We should eat something."

Dale, walking beside him, shaking, withdrawing, carving a fox from cedar with hands that wouldn't stay still — Dale listened to every word and didn't say anything because he understood that the boy was doing the same thing he was doing with the knife. Holding something. Making it matter. Keeping his hands busy so the rest of him could survive the walk.

Dale's hands were shaking. Not the cold — the Suboxone. He'd taken his last dose that morning. The withdrawal wouldn't hit fully for another twelve to twenty-four hours, but the edge of it was there — a tremor in the fingers, a tightness in the jaw. He carved as he walked, and the carving was a little rougher than usual, the strokes a little less controlled, and I watched him the way I watched everything: from behind, measuring, cataloguing, unable to help.

---

On the last rock scramble before the ridge, Marcus stopped and cut a length of river cane from a thicket beside the trail — five feet long, thumb-thick, the kind of cane that grew along every creek bottom in the Ozarks. He stripped the leaves and handed it to Ruth.

"Walking stick," he said. "Use it."

Within an hour everyone had one. Marcus cut them from cane and small hardwood saplings, sizing each to the user. The difference was immediate — a third point of contact on the rocky sections, something to brace against on the steep descents, a way to test footing before committing weight. I hadn't known I needed one until I had it. Then I couldn't imagine walking without it.

We made the ridgeline by late afternoon. Seven hours for three miles. In the old world, an hour's walk. In this world, an odyssey.

The ridgeline opened up. The trail ran along the spine of the ridge, sandstone outcrops on both sides, the forest canopy thinning to let the sky through. And the sky was — I don't have the word. I'd been looking at sky through steeple louvers and kitchen windows for three weeks. This was sky without a frame. Huge and blue and cold, the late-autumn clarity that comes to the Ozarks in November when the humidity dies and the air turns to glass.

To the east, the river valley spread out below us — thirty miles of lowland, the river a silver thread, the towns invisible at this distance but present as smudges of grey where the roads converged. Down there, the world was ending. From up here, you couldn't tell. The valley looked the way it had looked for ten thousand years: patient, indifferent, the land not caring what happened on its surface.

To the west, more ridgelines. Rolling, forested, extending to the horizon in diminishing blue layers like a painting of itself. The OHT ran along those ridgelines — we could see the next rise, and the one after that, and the one after that, each one a day's walk, each one a promise and a threat.

The forest was quiet.

Not the held-breath silence of a world monitoring itself for danger. This was living quiet. Wind in the remaining canopy leaves, a dry rattle that sounded like paper. A creek somewhere below, audible only as a texture in the air. The skitter of a squirrel or chipmunk in the underbrush — a real animal, doing real animal things, unbothered by the end of human civilization.

No Turned.

The population density up here was zero before the outbreak. The terrain — steep, rocky, pathless off-trail — was hostile to the collective behavior. Dense forest with ravines and bluffs broke the signal, scattered the herd, turned the Turned into confused individuals who wandered rather than hunted. Marcus had been right. The mountains were empty.

"Camp here," Marcus said. He'd found a bluff overlook — a sandstone shelf jutting out from the ridge, fifteen feet wide, protected on three sides by rock and forest. The view ran east into the valley. The bluff face dropped fifty feet — nothing was climbing up. The trail continued along the ridge behind us, the only approach a narrow path through thick undergrowth.

We made camp. Marcus and Sienna strung tarps between trees at the edge of the bluff — the lightweight ones from Atwoods, rigged with paracord, angled to shed rain and block wind. We rolled out sleeping pads on the rock — thin foam, not much padding, but insulation between body and stone. The pads were narrow. The rock was uneven. They were better than bare sandstone, but not by much.

Ruth sat on the folding camp chair Maria had insisted on carrying — three pounds of aluminum that Maria had defended against every objection about weight with the flat declaration "Ruth sits or Ruth doesn't walk tomorrow." Dale carved. The wood he was working was cedar — aromatic, reddish, he'd picked it up at the trailhead — and the smell of cedar shavings mixed with the cold stone and leaf rot of the ridge and made something that smelled like a world that was still possible.

We ate freeze-dried beef stew reconstituted with creek water heated on the camp stove. The portions were small. The portions were always going to be small. I could have eaten three of them and still wanted more. Everyone ate carefully, slowly, making the meal last, because making it last was the only way to pretend it was enough.

After dinner, the conversation nobody wanted to have: gear.

"We packed too much," Marcus said. He was looking at the pile of equipment we'd hauled up six hundred vertical feet. The extra water containers — unnecessary, since every hollow had a creek. The camp shovel. The hatchet handles that duplicated the ones on our belts. The second cooking pot. The heavy canned goods Maria had added as backup. Dale's second tarp. The extra paracord. "Every ounce we carry tomorrow, we carry up another ridge. And the ridge after that. For sixty miles."

The math was brutal: thirty-two pounds felt manageable in the church parking lot. It was not manageable on a switchback. My shoulders were bruised. My hips were raw. Ruth had barely made three miles, and her pack was the lightest.

We went through everything. The psychology of discarding was harder than the weight itself — everything felt essential until you'd carried it uphill. The shovel felt essential. The extra water felt essential. The big cans of soup that weighed twice what the freeze-dried meals weighed felt essential because they were *food* and food was the thing you thought about constantly and the thought of leaving food behind was physically painful.

We left the shovel. The extra water containers. The second pot. The heavy cans — we ate what we could that night, added them to the stew, forced ourselves full. Two of the three tents went; we'd keep one for Ruth and Caleb and sleep under tarps. The redundant paracord. A bag of tools nobody had used. By the time we were done, the discard pile looked like a yard sale on a sandstone shelf, and the packs were five pounds lighter, and five pounds was the difference between arriving and not.

"All you think about when you're walking is food," Marcus said, watching the pile. "All you think about when you're resting is gear. What you can drop. What you don't need. That's hiking. That's the whole thing."

Jim held a prayer. Short: "Thank you for this day. Thank you for these legs. Particularly Ruth's, which performed heroically."

Ruth: "My legs do not require divine commentary."

Jim: "They're getting it anyway."

Marcus lit a small fire — carefully, in a depression in the rock, the smoke rising into the canopy and dispersing. "No population up here," he said. "Nothing to attract. And the smoke disperses in the canopy before it clears the trees." He'd built fires on overnight hauls, sleeping by the side of his truck. He knew which fires were safe and which weren't, the same way he knew which roads flooded and which ridgelines were exposed.

Caleb fell asleep in Dale's lap, the beagle in one hand and the half-finished cardinal in the other. Dale's hands shook and he held the boy steady and the tremor in his hands didn't travel to the child, and the effort of keeping the two things separate — the shaking and the holding — was visible in his face as a tightness that nobody mentioned.

Marcus pointed at the sky. "Orion," he said. To Caleb, who was asleep and couldn't hear. "Rising in the east. See the belt — three stars in a line. And there —" He pointed. "The Pleiades. Seven sisters. My dispatcher used to call me the seventh sister because I was always the last one in." He said this to the sleeping boy and to nobody else, and the constellations were there — brighter than I'd ever seen them, brighter than I knew stars could be, because there was no light pollution for fifty miles in any direction and the sky was doing the thing it had always been doing and we'd just been too busy to see.

We talked for a long time that night. Not about the trail or the plan or the Turned — about before. Ruth told us about her husband, Gerald, who had died in 2019, and how he'd made the worst coffee in Johnson County and she'd drunk it every morning for forty-one years and never told him. Marcus described the first time he saw Ava walk — three steps from the coffee table to the couch, arms out, face split with a grin that was nothing like the grin the Turned wore because it was real, it was *for* something, and the difference between a smile that means joy and a smile that means nothing is the entire distance between us and them. Maria talked about growing up in El Paso and how her mother had organized the kitchen by color and how she'd thought it was crazy until she grew up and organized everything by system and realized she was her mother's daughter after all.

Jim said, "My wife's name was Eleanor. Not the same Eleanor. She made peach cobbler that could make you believe in God." That was all he said about her. It was enough.

Sienna leaned against my shoulder at some point and neither of us acknowledged it. The fire had burned low and the warmth was on one side and the November cold was on the other and the shoulder contact was a small, specific thing that didn't mean anything except that it meant everything.

"What are you thinking about?" she asked. Quiet. Just for me.

"Nothing."

"You're a bad liar." She said it without the sharpness — without the reprimand voice, the fierce-eyed challenge. She said it like someone who was worried. "You've been somewhere else all day. Even on the switchbacks. Like — you were there, but you weren't."

I almost told her. Almost said: *I'm angry all the time and the anger is the only reason I made it up the mountain today and that scares me.* But telling her would mean explaining the parking lot, which would mean saying *my mother* out loud, and I wasn't ready. The anger said I didn't need to be ready because ready was another word for soft.

"I'm tired," I said. "First day."

She studied me. Then she let it go — not because she believed me, but because she understood that pushing wouldn't work. Not tonight. She settled her head back against my shoulder and stayed.

I am putting this in the journal because it should contain the truth: I was sitting on a rock in the Boston Mountains at eleven o'clock at night with a girl's head on my shoulder and the Milky Way overhead and I was happy. Briefly, illogically happy. The anger was still there underneath, patient and dense. The happiness passed. The anger didn't. Both things on the record.

I wrote by firelight. The notebook was wrinkled from the septic tank and smelled faintly of things I wouldn't name. The pen was a ballpoint from Ruth's purse. The fire popped and the smoke rose and the stars were out and behind us the trail continued into the dark, climbing the next ridge, and the next, and the next.

I crawled into my sleeping bag on the foam pad and every muscle in my body announced its displeasure. Legs. Back. Shoulders. The specific, grinding ache of muscles that had been used for the first time and were now stiffening in the cold, contracting, turning into concrete. The pad kept me off the rock but didn't do much else — I could feel every contour of the sandstone through the foam, and the bag was warm enough but narrow, and I couldn't find a position where something wasn't pressing against something else.

The forest was not quiet. I'd thought forests were quiet — the peaceful silence of nature, the soothing sounds of the wild. This was a lie invented by people who had never slept in one. Something large crashed through the dead leaves thirty feet from camp. My heart rate jumped before Marcus said, from his post by the fire, "Possum." A five-pound marsupial that sounded like a bear stampede in dry oak leaves. An armadillo followed twenty minutes later — same thrashing, same cardiac event, same eventual identification. Then deer, their hooves cracking sticks in the dark. Then something unidentified that rustled and stopped and rustled and stopped and I never found out what it was and lay in the dark imagining options until my body surrendered to exhaustion and the imagination shut off.

We all smelled like smoke and sweat. The fire provided warmth for whoever was on watch — Marcus took first shift, Jim second — but the smoke got into everything. Hair. Sleeping bags. Clothes. The smell would be our constant companion. I'd stop noticing it by Day 3.

That night I dreamed I was in the trailer. Everything was right — the paneling, the counter, the burn mark. But the trailer was moving. Not on wheels — being dragged, the whole structure shuddering, the floor tilting, and through the kitchen window the trees were not the park's trees but the OHT forest, oaks and hickories scrolling past as the trailer was pulled through terrain it was never built for. I could hear the skirting tearing underneath, the vinyl shredding against rock, and I ran to the back door and opened it and the drop was not the gravel lot but a ravine, a hundred feet of empty air, and the trailer was sliding toward the edge and I couldn't stop it because you can't stop a house.

I woke to the sound of wind in the canopy and for three heartbeats I didn't know which world was real — the forest or the trailer — and my hand found my wrist and counted and the count was high, one-ten, one-oh-six, and I lay still and watched the fire embers and breathed until the numbers came down and the trailer dissolved and I was on a rock in the Boston Mountains and the stars were the only things that hadn't changed.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #13:**

*I started to write this entry as a joke about throwing up on the switchback. Caught myself. The self-deprecating deflection — Sienna called it building the case for my own helplessness and she was right. I'm still doing it automatically, the way you bite your nails. So: I threw up and then I kept walking. The throwing up was what happened. The not-stopping was what I did. Those are different things. I'm trying to learn the difference.*

*I have identified a motivational resource I did not previously have access to. That's how I'm going to describe it because describing it accurately would require writing words I'm not ready to see in my own handwriting. It converts physical pain into something I can use rather than something I endure. I don't know if it's sustainable and I don't know if it's healthy and right now I don't care because it kept me on the trail.*

*Fifty-seven miles to go, then thirty-five on the highway. At three miles a day, Ruth's medication runs out before we get there. The math never quite works. We walk anyway.*
