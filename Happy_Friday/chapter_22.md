# Chapter 22: Mom

Day 39. The highway was flat and empty and there was nothing to think about except the things I'd been refusing to think about for sixteen days.

The mountains were behind us. The trail was behind us. The roadblock was behind us — the razor wire and the three hundred people I'd killed by borrowing a wolf-hunting technique. The fortified group was behind us — nine people in a gas station who wouldn't leave. All of it was behind us and we'd carry it for the rest of our lives.

Highway 71 stretched north in a straight line, flat, featureless, the kind of road that gives the mind nothing to hold onto. No switchbacks. No creek crossings. No rocks to navigate or hills to climb. Just asphalt and sky and the rattle of shopping cart wheels and a steady rhythm of walking that required no thought. When the machinery has nothing to process, it idles. When it idles, the things it's been holding back seep through.

I was tired. Not the productive tiredness of trail days. This was cumulative — built in layers like sediment: weeks of insufficient food on top of blisters that had healed and re-opened and healed again on top of a month of sleeping on the ground on top of three hundred people shredded on razor wire on top of everything else. Everything else being: a woman in blue scrubs in a hospital parking lot in Clarksville, standing with bare feet and nothing behind her eyes. My mother. I'd opened that sealed envelope in the truck with Marcus and had been carrying it open ever since — visible, unbearable, following me through sixty miles of trail and thirty miles of highway like a weight heavier than the pack.

The analytical machinery had been carrying it — taking the unbearable thing and converting it into data, filing it, processing it into something manageable. Running nonstop since Clarksville. Since I saw her face and Marcus kept driving and I said "I see her" and the words were data and the container held.

The container held through the first days on the trail, when the physical suffering was new enough to occupy the machinery's full capacity. Through the creek crossings and the gear discarding and the nightly inventory of blisters and the obsessive management of socks and the slow adaptation of a body that had never been asked to do anything like this. Through Dale's withdrawal peaking and breaking. Through the Rock House Shelter, where we'd slept dry and warm and I'd almost felt something like peace. Through the stray Turned hunter in the woods, nocking his invisible arrow, who reminded me that the organism took everyone — hunters and nurses, fathers and mothers, people who had been people. Through the roadblock, where I became the kind of person who engineers a wolf knife out of razor wire and walks through the results. Through the gas station, where I watched myself fail to save people for the third time and understood that the pattern would repeat forever.

The container held because the machinery was running. And on Day 39, on a flat stretch of highway with nothing to think about, the machinery stopped.

Not dramatically. Just a quiet failure, like a generator running out of fuel. One moment I was walking and processing and carrying the weight in its compartment. The next moment the compartment was open and the weight was everywhere — in my legs, in my lungs, in the flat grey light of a November afternoon, in the sound of my own breathing, in the empty highway that stretched in both directions like a sentence with no end.

I stopped on the highway. The group moved on for a few steps. Sienna noticed first — she always noticed first.

I was standing on the asphalt and I was not moving because there was nowhere to move to. Every direction was away from her. The distance that mattered was temporal, irreversible — between a kitchen where she poured coffee and a parking lot where she stood with bare feet. No amount of walking would close it.

"Nate," Sienna said.

I looked at her. She was tired — they all were, the highway's flatness and monotony grinding something that switchbacks and creek crossings at least distracted you from. She looked at me and she saw it. She always saw it.

I didn't say anything. The highway said it for me — stretching in both directions, flat and empty and indifferent, and the emptiness was the truest thing about the world.

Sienna took my hand.

She had never done this before. In five weeks of proximity and argument and whatever we were becoming, she had touched my elbow twice and my arm once, each time brief and functional. This was different. Her fingers between my fingers. Her grip firm and warm. She was holding me in the world by the specific physical fact of her hand.

We stood there. On the highway. Five minutes or five hours.

Then we walked on. Because walking was the only verb left.

I didn't write in the journal that night. I sat by the fire at the roadside camp and said nothing and ate nothing and everyone left me alone because they understood. Caleb brought me the wooden beagle and put it in my lap without a word and went back to Marcus's side.

Two days later I opened the notebook.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #16:**

*She would have been scared. At the end. She would have been so scared.*

That night I dreamed she was fine.

The real one. The kitchen in the trailer, 6 PM on a Thursday, still in her scrubs because she'd worked a double and hadn't changed. Making coffee she shouldn't have been drinking that late. The radio on the counter playing something country and terrible that she loved. The particular way she leaned her hip against the counter while the pot brewed — the posture of a woman who had been on her feet for sixteen hours and was going to be on them for eight more because I had a dentist appointment in the morning and she wanted to make sure I ate breakfast before we left.

"Happy Friday, bud," she said.

And it was right. It was *her* — the voice, the cadence, the way the words carried the weight of a person who said them every week because the saying was a ritual and the ritual was love and the love was the thing she'd built our whole small life around. It was the realest thing I'd dreamed since the world ended. Not the nightmare versions — not the too-wide smile, not the Knock-voice bleeding through — just my mother, in our kitchen, saying the thing she always said.

I said, "It's Thursday, Mom."

"Close enough," she said, and smiled, and poured two cups, and the dream was so ordinary and so perfect that I would have lived in it forever.

Then I was outside.

Just outside, in the parking lot in Clarksville, at night, and the kitchen window was a hospital window three stories up and she was standing behind the glass. Still in scrubs. Still holding the coffee. But her face was wrong — smooth, blank, the expression I'd seen on two hundred Turned and had seen on her, across the parking lot, the day Marcus kept driving. Her mouth moved. No sound through the glass. She put her hand against the window, palm flat, fingers spread.

I put my hand against the glass. I couldn't not. The glass was warm.

I woke walking.

I was ten feet from my sleeping bag, moving past the dying campfire toward the highway, and my heart was at 118 and I didn't know where I was or when I was or whether the glass had been real. My hand was still raised, palm out, reaching for a window that wasn't there.

I didn't go back to the sleeping bag. The dream was still in the air — the *good* part, the kitchen and the coffee and her voice — and going back to sleep meant either returning to it or losing it and I couldn't survive either one.

I took the binoculars and walked. Back up the highway. Back the way we'd come. Back toward Clarksville.
