# Chapter 10: The Lyles

We heard the bullhorn on Day 10.

I was in the steeple on morning watch — 6 AM, the early October light catching frost on the parking lot gravel, the Turned in their positions like chess pieces on a board I was learning to read. Sixteen of them now. The newest arrival was a woman in hospital scrubs who'd walked in from the direction of Highway 21 sometime in the night. She stood in the lot near the road, swaying faintly, face tilted toward the eastern horizon where the sun hadn't risen yet. Her scrub top was gone — just the pants and a sports bra, her torso bare to the morning air. The skin across her shoulders had the faint greenish cast I'd been tracking, darker than Pembrook's had been at the same stage. She'd removed the top herself. It was folded on the curb behind her, neat, deliberate, the way you'd fold laundry.

Then, from the north — maybe three blocks — a voice, amplified, distorted by distance and cheap electronics:

"THIS IS A SECURE ZONE. SURVIVORS WELCOME. WE ARE ARMED AND DEFENDED. COME TO THE AMERICAN FLAG ON CEDAR STREET."

I put the binoculars to my eyes and found it: a house, two-story, three blocks north and one east. Plywood over the windows. A generator humming — I could hear it now, a low mechanical drone that carried in the silence. An American flag hung from the roof gutters, oversized, the kind you'd see at a car dealership. And on the front porch, a man with a bullhorn and a rifle slung across his chest.

I watched the Turned react. Every head in the parking lot turned toward the sound. Several began walking — not toward the church, toward the noise. The woman in scrubs drifted north. Two others followed. The bullhorn was a magnet, and it was pulling Turned away from us and toward whoever was up there broadcasting their position to every organism in a half-mile radius.

I went downstairs.

---

"Craig Lyle," Jim said. He was sitting at the folding table with his coffee, his metoprolol, and his Bible. He didn't look surprised. "Sheriff's deputy. His wife Tammy runs the range on Highway 64. Son Brett, plays linebacker for Clarksville."

"He's using a bullhorn," I said.

"Craig would."

"He's drawing them. I watched three Turned start walking toward his house in the last five minutes."

Jim sipped his coffee. "Craig is a good man. He protected this town for twenty years. He's doing what he knows how to do."

"What he knows how to do is going to get him killed."

Jim set his mug down. He looked at me with the patient, measuring expression that I'd learned meant he was about to say something I needed to hear and didn't want to.

"You're right," he said. "And being right doesn't give you the right to let him die without trying."

"I'm not saying —"

"You're saying stay away because he's loud and he's wrong and his wrongness is useful to us because it draws Turned away from the church. You're calculating the strategic value of another man's mistake."

The kitchen was very quiet. Ruth, at the top of the stairs, had stopped pretending to read.

"I wasn't —" But I was. The thought had been there — half-formed, unspoken, ugly — that the Lyles' noise was pulling Turned north and that was good for us. I hadn't articulated it because articulating it would mean being the kind of person who calculates the value of another family's danger, and I didn't want to be that person, but I was that person, and Jim had seen it before I had.

"We need to talk to them," Jim said.

Sienna, who'd been doing push-ups against the wall — her morning routine, the athlete's body demanding movement — stopped and turned around. "They have guns and a generator. We have canned corn and a pastor."

"We have information," I said.

"Information they won't want to hear." She looked at me. "You're going to walk up to an armed sheriff's deputy and tell him his survival strategy is wrong? You?"

The "you" carried weight. She didn't mean it cruelly. She meant: you, the kid who won't make eye contact at the grocery store; you, who couldn't order food at a restaurant without rehearsing the sentence; you, whose longest conversation with a stranger before last week was asking a librarian where the bathroom was. That "you."

"Not me," I said. "Jim and Marcus. They're adults. Craig will listen to adults."

"Craig will listen to authority," Marcus said from his corner, where he was doing the thing Marcus always did — sitting, listening, saying nothing until he had something worth saying. "He's law enforcement. He respects rank. Jim's a pastor, I'm old enough to not be dismissed. We go."

---

They went at noon, when I'd observed the Turned were most dispersed. I watched from the steeple, walkie-talkie in hand, the same setup as every mission since we'd found the radios — I called down the positions, they adjusted their route. Jim and Marcus walked north on the residential streets behind the church — side streets, quiet, a few Turned visible at distance but none close. They moved at Jim's pace, which was the pace of a man who'd been walking calmly through a dangerous world for two weeks and had elevated it to an art form.

I had the binoculars. Sienna was beside me. She'd insisted on steeple duty during the mission, and I'd agreed, and we were sitting eighteen inches apart in the narrow space and I was acutely aware of the eighteen inches in the way that you are aware of eighteen inches when you're fifteen and the person next to you is Sienna Okafor and you've been trying to convince yourself for six days that you don't notice things about her and you absolutely notice everything about her.

She smelled like soap. The church had bar soap in the bathroom and she used it and she smelled like Ivory soap and I hated my brain for noticing this during a surveillance operation.

"They're there," Sienna said. She had sharper eyes than me. Through the binoculars I found them: Jim and Marcus at the Lyles' porch. Craig Lyle had come out — big man, crew cut, sheriff's department jacket, rifle in his hands but pointed down. Body language: wary, not hostile. He shook Jim's hand.

They talked for twenty minutes. I couldn't hear it. I could read posture: Jim leaning forward, earnest, palms open. Marcus standing back, arms crossed, the body language of a man offering backup, not argument. Craig listening. Head tilting. The small adjustments people make when they're processing information that doesn't fit their model.

Then Craig shook his head. Not violently — politely. The head-shake of a man who has heard what you said and decided, respectfully, that you're wrong. He clapped Jim on the shoulder. He said something. Jim said something back. Craig went inside.

Jim and Marcus walked back. Twenty minutes there, twenty minutes home. My heart rate was elevated the entire time and when they came through the side door I realized I'd been clenching my jaw so hard my teeth ached.

"He listened," Jim said. "He didn't hear."

"What did you tell him?"

"That the noise draws them. That the fortifications create a target. That the mechanism is about physiology, not firepower."

"And?"

"He said he appreciated the concern. He said he had a duty to protect his family. He said he'd survived twenty years in law enforcement by trusting his training and he wasn't going to stop now." Jim paused. "He's not wrong about any of that. He's just applying it to the wrong situation."

"Cognitive dissonance," I said. The passage from *Brunner & Suddarth*, circled on day two. "The brain rejects new information that contradicts existing belief because the discomfort of revising the belief is worse than the danger of maintaining it. He can't hear what you're telling him because hearing it would mean everything he's done — the boards, the guns, the perimeter — was wrong. And if that's wrong, then he doesn't know how to protect his family. The uncertainty is more terrifying than the Turned."

Jim looked at me. "That's not wrong either. Knowing why he won't listen doesn't help him listen."

"No," I said. "But it tells me something about what we're up against. Not just the organism. The human brain. The human brain is its own obstacle and it might be the bigger one."

---

That afternoon, Ruth did something that changed my model of her.

We had a problem. The church's water supply was gravity-fed from the municipal tower, and the pressure had been dropping for days. The tank on the roof — a supplemental cistern Jim had installed years ago for the baptistery — had a float valve that regulated inflow, and the valve was stuck. No pressure meant no refill. We had maybe two days of stored water.

Dale offered to climb to the roof. Marcus said he'd go. Jim said it was his church and his roof. I started calculating whether we could rig a manual pump from parts in the building.

Ruth walked past all of us, went to the utility closet behind the kitchen, and came back with a pipe wrench, a roll of Teflon tape, and a pair of channel-lock pliers. She climbed the access ladder to the roof hatch — seventy-two years old, bad knees, climbing a vertical ladder — and we heard her up there for about fifteen minutes. Clanking. One muffled curse. Then the sound of water running.

She came back down with grease on her hands and her cardigan askew.

"My husband was a plumber," she said, to the room's collective silence. "Forty-one years. I helped him on jobs every summer. The float valve was corroded — I freed the stem and re-seated the gasket. It'll hold for now. The Teflon tape is a temporary fix; you'll want to replace the entire assembly when circumstances permit." She looked at our faces. "What? You thought all I could do was correct your grammar?"

"I thought —" I started.

"You thought I was an old woman with a pill bottle and a sharp tongue. That's fair. I cultivated that impression. It's useful — people who underestimate you leave you alone, and being left alone is my preferred state." She washed her hands at the kitchen sink. "Leonard — my husband — died in 2019. Heart attack on a job site. I learned more from him than from any education course I ever took, and I took all of them. He could fix anything." She dried her hands. "I can fix *most* things. The distinction is important."

She went back upstairs to her novel.

I added to my mental model of Ruth Fenn: not just a retired teacher with a sharp tongue, but a woman who'd spent forty years alongside a tradesman and had absorbed, through proximity and attention, a skillset that none of us had thought to ask about because we'd been too busy being corrected about grammar.

The assumptions you don't question are the ones that kill you. I'd written that in the notebook about the Lyles. It applied closer to home than I'd realized.

---

That evening, Maria and I had a conversation that I didn't expect and didn't like.

She was doing inventory — her nightly ritual, counting cans, updating the rationing spreadsheet she'd scratched onto the back of a church bulletin. I was at the folding table with the notebook, mapping the Turned positions I'd logged from the steeple.

"The Lyles have food," she said. Not looking up from her count.

"The Lyles have a lot of things."

"If they fall — when they fall — their supplies will be in that house. Canned goods, ammunition, the generator fuel. It'll be scattered in the rubble, but it'll be there."

I put my pen down. "You're planning to scavenge the Lyles' supplies after they die."

"I'm planning for the group to survive. Those are the same thing." She turned a can of green beans label-out and placed it on the shelf. "Every person who joins us costs us 1.3 days of food at current rationing. Marcus cost us 1.3 days. The next person will too. If we take in survivors without replenishing supplies, we starve together instead of separately. That's not compassion. That's arithmetic."

"Maria —"

"I'm not saying don't help people. I'm saying know the cost. And I'm saying that when the Lyles' house comes apart — and it will, Nate, you know it will — the supplies in that house become available and we need to be ready to get them before the Turned scatter them or the rain ruins them."

She was right. I hated that she was right. I hated more that the thought hadn't occurred to me — that the organizer, the office manager, the woman who saw every resource as a line item, had looked at the Lyles' probable death and calculated the caloric yield before I had.

"That's cold," I said.

"Yes." She put the last can on the shelf and closed the closet door. "So is January. We'll need the calories."

She went to bed. I sat at the table and stared at my map and thought about the difference between being cold and being right and whether there was a line between them or whether the line was something we drew after the fact to make ourselves feel better about decisions we'd already made.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #5:**

*Day 10. The Lyles are three blocks north. Armed, fortified, broadcasting. Drawing Turned like a magnet. Jim tried to talk to them. Craig listened and didn't hear.*

*I've been wrong about an assumption. I assumed the Turned's behavior was binary: either herding or not. But watching the Walmart cluster and now the Lyles, and going back through the interchange report, I think there are at least three modes. The first is herding — patient, strategic, the fear-farming. The second is what Sienna saw at the blockade: a sound, sharp and short, and others orienting to it. Directed. Purposeful. Food-driven. Not herding — something more like hunting, though I'm not ready to call it that yet. The third is what happens when density tips — the swarm, the demolition behavior, the thing Moss described without naming. Herding is coordinated strategy. The food-driven behavior is coordinated predation. The swarm is the coordination collapsing entirely.*

*Three modes. I need a better taxonomy but the pattern is there.*

*The clothing pattern is also there. Scrub woman removed her top. Pembrook's robe has been open since day one. The garden woman lost her shoes first. At the interchange, soldiers had removed body armor and jackets. The oldest Turned are the most exposed. Bare feet first, then shirts. The organism is removing clothing and I don't know why but the sun-facing and the undressing have to be connected. The green skin, the light orientation, and now the systematic removal of anything that covers the skin. I'm circling something I'm not ready to name.*

*I need to watch the Lyles' perimeter. I need to count. I need to know where the number is when it tips.*

*Maria is already planning what to do with their supplies. This is either pragmatism or something darker and I genuinely can't tell which. Dale heard her and his knife stopped moving for about five seconds, which is the longest I've ever seen Dale's hands be still. Maria saw it too — her eyes tracked his hands, held there for a beat, then went back to the cans. She didn't soften. But she saw the cost. I think she always sees the cost. I think the cost is what she's calculating when the rest of us think she's just counting cans.*

*I told Craig's situation was cognitive dissonance. I'm starting to think mine is too. I understand the mechanism and I still can't make myself act on it. Knowing the right thing and doing the right thing are separated by a gap I haven't figured out how to cross. The textbook doesn't have a chapter for that.*

# Chapter 11: What the Radio Said

On Day 12, Dr. Moss gave us a longer broadcast.

Marcus had been working the CB every evening, scanning Channel 21, catching fragments. Most were static. Some were repetitions of things we'd already heard — the endocrine mechanism, the beta-blocker protocol. But on this evening, the atmospheric conditions aligned or her transmitter was running better or whatever variables govern radio propagation decided to cooperate, and we got twelve unbroken minutes.

Everyone gathered in the basement. Jim in his chair. Ruth on a folding chair with her novel closed on her lap. Dale carving — he'd finished the beagle and was starting something new, a bird of some kind, though it was too early to tell what species. Maria standing by the pantry closet with her arms crossed. Sienna sitting on the floor with her back against the wall, legs extended, the posture of an athlete at rest — which still looked more alert than most people standing up. And me, at the table, with the notebook open and a pen in my hand, writing as fast as I could.

The static thinned and Dr. Moss's voice came through, clearer than we'd ever heard it.

"— repeat this broadcast daily for any survivors in the northwest Arkansas region. My name is Dr. Eleanor Moss. I am a research biologist at the University of Arkansas. I am broadcasting from the life sciences building on campus. This facility has generator power, laboratory equipment, and supplies sufficient for an extended period."

She paused. I could hear her turning a page.

"I want to address a misconception that may be costing lives. Many survivor groups have adopted a fortification strategy — boarding windows, arming perimeters, concentrating in defensible positions. This strategy is counterproductive. The organism's collective behavior is drawn to human activity. Noise, light, electromagnetic output, and particularly the biochemical signatures of stress — all of these attract the Turned. Fortification concentrates these signals. Every defended position I have observed or received reports about has followed the same trajectory: the defenses attract Turned, the Turned accumulate, and when the local density exceeds a critical threshold — what I'm calling the density threshold — the collective behavior destabilizes."

She said this the way you'd describe a chemical reaction — factual, measured, the voice of a scientist reading from data.

"Below the threshold, the Turned exhibit patient herding behavior. Targeted social manipulation. Voice mimicry. They are coordinated, strategic, and nonviolent. Above the threshold, the coordination collapses into undirected destruction. The patient predator becomes a demolition event. The threshold varies — I do not yet have reliable numbers, and I want to stress that I do not have reliable numbers, because giving you a number that's wrong could get you killed. What I can tell you is that the threshold appears to depend on spatial density, not raw count. Thirty Turned spread across a square mile are below threshold. Thirty in a parking lot may not be."

I was writing as fast as I could. Sienna was watching me write. Marcus had his hand on the radio as if physical contact could hold the signal steady.

"The implications for survival are these: stay small. Stay quiet. Do not concentrate. Do not fortify. Do not engage. If you are receiving this and you are alive, it is because your biochemistry is below the activation threshold. Do not do anything that raises it. Every fortress is a countdown. Every act of defense is an invitation."

Static intruded for a few seconds. Then she came back, and her voice had shifted — less clinical, more human, as if she'd looked up from her notes and was speaking directly to whoever was listening.

"There is more to communicate. The organism's adaptation rate is accelerating. The Turned I observe on campus are more coordinated, more efficient, and more physically resilient than the Turned from week one. This is not a static threat. It is improving. I have data on this — spectrographic analysis, behavioral timelines — that I cannot transmit by radio. If you can reach this facility, I can share what I know. And what I know may — I want to be careful about promising — may include countermeasures."

A pause.

"If you are hearing this and you are weighing whether to move: the risk of staying increases every day. The risk of moving can be managed. I recommend low-density routes. Avoid highways, interchanges, and urban corridors. The Ozark National Forest is largely depopulated. The ridgeline trails offer —"

Static swallowed her. The signal broke. Marcus adjusted the antenna, scanned, found nothing. Channel 21 was empty.

---

The basement was quiet for a long time.

Jim broke it. "She didn't mention God."

"She's a scientist," I said.

"I noticed." He wasn't offended. He was noting a gap — the absence of something he looked for in every framework, the way a builder checks for a foundation. "Scientists describe what's happening. They don't always describe what it means."

"Maybe what it means is what's happening. Maybe there isn't a layer underneath."

"Maybe." He didn't argue. He folded his hands. "Or maybe the layer underneath is the part she hasn't found yet."

Marcus capped his flask. "The density threshold. She said it varies. She doesn't have numbers."

"I've been counting," I said. "The Walmart cluster hit twenty-five and I saw behavioral changes — twitchiness, agitation. The Lyles have maybe twenty in their perimeter and they're stable so far, but the count is growing. If it's about spatial density, not raw numbers..."

"Then the Lyles' property — what, quarter acre? — is a tighter space than the Walmart parking lot. The threshold would be lower."

"Yes."

"How much lower?"

"I don't know. She doesn't know. That's the problem — the most important number in this situation is the one nobody can give us, and the cost of guessing wrong is watching the Lyles' house come apart."

---

Dale's knife had stopped moving.

This was notable because Dale's knife never stopped moving. In the ten days I'd known him, his hands had been in constant motion — carving, whittling, shaping. The beagle. The bird. Small abstract things he didn't name. The motion was his regulation mechanism, the physical loop that kept his brain from spinning into the places it went when it was idle.

The knife was still.

"She said the organism is adapting," he said. "Getting more efficient."

"Yes."

"Does that mean it adapts to medication? Does it — does it learn to work around the Suboxone?"

The question hung in the air. I looked at Dale and saw what was behind the question: not curiosity but terror, the specific terror of a man whose survival depends on a molecule and who has just been told that the thing he's surviving against is learning.

"I don't know," I said. This was the truth. "She didn't say that specifically. She said the Turned's behavior is adapting. That could mean the organism is getting better at operating human bodies. It doesn't necessarily mean it's overcoming pharmaceutical suppression."

"But it could."

"It could."

Dale picked up the knife. Started carving again. The strokes were tighter, faster, removing more material than necessary. He was making a new shape and he was making it angry.

Maria, from the pantry closet, said: "How much Suboxone do we have?"

"Eighteen days," Dale said. Without looking up. He'd been counting. Of course he'd been counting.

"The pharmacy run got beta-blockers for Jim and Ruth. Did it get Suboxone?"

"Suboxone isn't behind the counter at a small-town pharmacy," Dale said. "It's prescribed through clinics. Controlled distribution. The nearest clinic was in Fort Smith and Fort Smith is —" He didn't finish. Fort Smith was forty miles west on I-40, through exactly the kind of urban corridor that Moss had just told us to avoid.

"Eighteen days," Maria said. She was doing math. I could see her doing it — the same calculation she'd applied to the food supply, the same accounting she applied to everything. Resources in, resources out, time to zero. "And then what?"

Dale didn't answer. His knife moved. The wood curled.

"And then I find out whether twelve years of sobriety and six months of yoga are enough to keep my nervous system below whatever the line is." He looked up. His eyes were flat. "I'll let you know."

---

That evening nobody wanted to be alone and nobody wanted to talk about what Moss had said, so we didn't. Jim made coffee — the last of the good grounds, not the instant — and didn't apologize for the extravagance, which was itself a kind of statement. Ruth read aloud from her romance novel, not because anyone asked but because the silence needed filling, and she chose to fill it with a scene involving a Scottish duke and an heiress and a misunderstanding about a horse, and it was so absurdly, magnificently irrelevant that we all just listened. Maria corrected a plot point. Dale said the horse breed was wrong. Marcus said he'd driven through Scotland once and the roads were terrible. These observations had nothing to do with anything and that was the entire point.

Sienna was sitting on the floor near the stairs, stretching — a habit from her old life that she maintained the way Dale maintained his carving, as a regulation mechanism, a way of telling her body it still existed for a reason. At one point she caught my eye and made a face — a small, private expression that meant *this is ridiculous and I'm grateful for it* — and I made a face back that meant approximately the same thing, and the exchange lasted half a second and contained more communication than anything I'd written in the notebook all week.

We didn't solve anything that evening. We didn't plan or strategize or calculate. We just occupied the same room and let the room be enough. I am recording this because the journal is supposed to be a survival document, and this was survival — not the dramatic kind, not the running and hiding kind, but the kind where you remind yourself that the people around you are people and not just assets on a board, and that the board is not the point. The board was never the point.

Marcus broke the quiet. Not deliberately — Marcus never did anything deliberately except drive and drink, and he was doing less of both. He was sitting on his pew, back against the wall, flask between his knees.

"Question," he said. "Serious one."

Jim looked up from his Bible.

"Has anyone tried killing one?"

The room changed. Not the temperature — the air. Ruth's novel lowered an inch. Dale's knife paused mid-stroke. Maria's head turned from the pantry with the precise rotation of a radar dish acquiring a target.

"Killing," Jim said. The word sat in his mouth like a stone.

"They stand in the parking lot. They don't move. They don't dodge. Somebody walks up with a hatchet, hits one in the head — what happens? Does it die?"

"They're people, Marcus."

"They're standing in a parking lot in the rain using dead people's voices to scare other people into joining them. That's not people behavior, Jim. That's predator behavior wearing a people costume."

Dale's knife moved again — one slow stroke. "What if they feel it?"

Marcus looked at him. "What if they do? Isn't that worse? Being trapped inside something that uses your body to hurt people you love — isn't that the thing that's worse than dying?"

Nobody had an answer for that. Jim's mouth opened and closed. Ruth's novel went back up, but her eyes weren't tracking the page.

"We don't know enough," I said. "We don't know if they can be killed — Moss said they're physically resilient, the organism maintains the host. We don't know if killing one triggers a response from the others. We don't know anything, and not knowing is the thing that should stop us, not morality."

"Morality's the thing that should stop us first," Jim said. Quiet. Certain.

"Then morality and ignorance are on the same side for once," I said. "We don't kill what we don't understand."

Marcus capped his flask. "I'm not saying we should. I'm asking if anyone's tried." He looked around the room. "Because if nobody's tried, then nobody knows. And 'nobody knows' is a hell of a thing to bet your life on."

The question hung in the basement like smoke. Nobody answered it. Nobody put it away, either.

That night Marcus woke the basement.

It wasn't a scream — it was a name, pulled out of him like something physical. "Ava!" — sharp, desperate, the sound of a man reaching for something in the dark and finding nothing. By the time I was fully awake he was sitting up on his pew, hands on his knees, breathing hard. The room was quiet. Ruth had her eyes open. Dale, on the nearest pew, hadn't moved, but his voice came through the dark, low and even.

"I dream about the highway too," Dale said.

Marcus said nothing. After a minute his breathing slowed. He lay back down. The dark settled over us again.

In the morning nobody mentioned it. But the silence had a different quality — not the comfortable silence of the evening before but the silence of people who'd all been awake in the dark thinking the same thing and waiting for someone else to say it.

I said it. Over breakfast — the cold oatmeal, Ruth's insistence — I said: "What happens if someone turns from a nightmare?"

The oatmeal got very quiet.

"The mechanism is fear," I said. "Adrenaline, cortisol, sustained sympathetic activation. Nightmares produce all of those. We're sleeping six feet apart in a basement. If someone crosses the threshold in their sleep —"

"They wake up Turned," Dale said. His voice was flat. He wasn't speculating. He was running the scenario the way a man in recovery runs relapse scenarios — not *if* but *when*, not *could it happen* but *what does it look like when it does.*

"Would we know?" Ruth asked. Her hands were steady on her coffee mug but her knuckles were white. "If someone turned in their sleep. Would we know immediately, or would they — would the organism —"

"Mimic," I said. "The organism mimics. That's what herding *is.* It uses the host's voice, the host's face. If someone turned in the dark, alone, among sleepers —" I stopped. The image was there: one of us, lying still, eyes open in the dark, the grin spreading, listening to the others breathe. Using our names. *Hey, you okay?* in a voice you'd been trusting for two weeks. "We might not know until it was too late."

The basement was very still.

Maria spoke first. "We post a watch. One person awake, all night, watching the others sleep."

"Watching for what?" Dale said. "The smile? Heart rate? How do you tell the difference between a nightmare and a conversion when both look like someone thrashing in the dark?"

"Blood pressure cuff," I said. "Mine reads continuously. If someone spikes above threshold —"

"One cuff for seven people. And the person wearing it is the one you're monitoring, not the six you aren't."

Jim had been listening with his hands folded, the posture he used when he was organizing something in his head before releasing it. "We post a watch," he said. "Not to monitor. To *be there.* One person awake, watching the sleepers. Not because we can prevent a turning — we probably can't. But because if it happens, someone is awake to respond. To wake the others. To get people out."

Ruth set her mug down. "You're asking us to watch each other the way we watch *them.*"

"I'm asking us to love each other enough to stay awake."

Dale's knife was moving — fast, sharp strokes. "I'll sleep separated. Upstairs. Away from the group."

"Dale —"

"My withdrawal spikes in the early morning. Three, four AM. That's when my cortisol peaks. If anyone in this room is going to turn from a nightmare, it's me, and I'd rather be upstairs alone than downstairs among people I —" He stopped cutting. "People I don't want to hurt."

"Nobody is sleeping alone," Jim said. "That's not how we do this."

"Then how do we do this?" Marcus asked. He'd been quiet since the nightmare, the name still sitting in the air between us. "Because the kid's right. We're all dreaming bad. We're all spiking. And if someone turns —" He looked at me. "What do we do? Hold them down? Lock them in a room? Kill them?"

Nobody answered. The word *kill* sat on the table like something physical.

"We don't have to solve all of it today," Jim said. "We solve the first part. Watch rotation. Two-hour shifts. One person awake with a flashlight, watching the room. If someone spikes — thrashing, the sounds we know — the watcher wakes me. We assess together."

"And if the assessment is bad?" Maria asked.

"Then we deal with it. Together. In the light."

We set up the rotation that morning. Two-hour shifts, midnight to six. Jim took the first slot. Marcus took second. I took third. Dale insisted on fourth — the pre-dawn hours, his worst window, arguing that if he was going to be awake sweating through cortisol spikes anyway, he might as well be useful.

I wrote it in the notebook: *We are now watching ourselves the way we watch the Turned. The perimeter is inside the room.*

And separately: *Marcus dreams about Ava. The phone screen going dark. Three days in the cab with nothing but bourbon and a dead phone and the sound of Turned walking past the windows. He carries the dream the way he carries the phone — something broken he won't put down.*

---

I went up to the steeple after the broadcast. I needed to think, and thinking happened better with the binoculars and the long view — the park, the road, the Lyles' compound to the north, the Walmart across the interstate to the south. The October sun was low, casting long shadows across the parking lot. The Turned stood in their positions, faces angled toward the light.

Jim came up the stairs about twenty minutes later. He didn't say anything at first — just stood at the louvers, looking out at the parking lot with the expression of a man conducting a service for people who couldn't hear him.

"Tom Hadley," he said, pointing. "Third from the left. The one by the utility pole."

I found him through the binoculars. A heavyset man in a flannel shirt, face tilted toward the sun, the standard posture. Nothing distinctive.

"He directed the choir," Jim said. "Twenty-two years. Every Sunday, Wednesday rehearsal, Christmas cantata. He had this thing he did" — Jim raised his right hand, fingers together, making a small scooping motion — "when the sopranos came in. Like he was pulling the sound out of the air."

I looked again. Tom Hadley's hands were at his sides. Then — so subtle I would have missed it without the binoculars — his right hand moved. Fingers together, a small scooping motion, the ghost of a cue to singers who would never sing again. The motion lasted two seconds. Then his hand dropped and he was still.

"That's not the organism," Jim said. "The organism doesn't know how to conduct a choir. That's Tom."

I lowered the binoculars. Jim was watching Hadley the way a father watches a sleeping child — with tenderness and with the specific grief of seeing someone present and unreachable at the same time.

"Marcus asked if we could kill them," I said.

"I heard."

"If Tom's still in there — if the person persists inside the host — then killing the Turned isn't pest control. It's something else."

"It's murder," Jim said. Simply. Not arguing. Naming.

"Or mercy."

"Maybe. But we don't get to decide that from a steeple with binoculars. We don't get to decide that without knowing what he feels, if he feels, whether the Tom doing the scooping motion is a person trapped or a recording playing back. And since we can't know —"

"We don't act."

"We don't act *yet.*" He looked at me. "I'm not saying never. I'm saying not from ignorance. Not from convenience. If we ever do that — if we ever cross that line — it has to be because we understand what we're ending. Not because it's easier than understanding."

He went back downstairs. I stayed in the steeple and watched Tom Hadley conduct his empty choir, and I didn't know which possibility unsettled me more — that he was still in there, or that he wasn't and the organism was borrowing his hands for a purpose I couldn't fathom.

I was revising assumptions. This was the process — the thing *Brunner & Suddarth* didn't teach but that the situation was teaching me, one failure at a time. You observe. You form a model. The model predicts behavior. When the behavior deviates from the prediction, you revise the model. You don't get attached to the model. You don't defend it. You let it be wrong and you build a better one.

My first model: the Turned are dangerous because they herd you and scare you and the fear turns you. This was true but incomplete.

My second model: the danger is biochemical, not behavioral. Keep your adrenaline down and you're invisible. Also true. Also incomplete.

The new model, after Moss's broadcast and Sienna's report from the blockade: the danger is *layered.* Layer one is the herding — the fear-farming, the conversion cycle. We'd learned to counter that. Layer two is the density threshold — the swarm behavior that makes them destructive. We couldn't counter that; we could only avoid it. Layer three — the one that scared me most — was the hunger. Sienna had seen them eating the dead at the interchange. When the easy food ran out, the Turned would expand their search. They wouldn't need to scare you to kill you. They'd just need to find you.

And underneath all three layers was the thing Moss had described without dwelling on: the organism was adapting. Getting better. The Turned from week one were clumsy, degrading, barely functional. The Turned from week two were coordinated, strategic, increasingly efficient. If the trajectory continued — and why wouldn't it — the Turned from week four or six or eight would be something we hadn't seen yet and couldn't predict.

Every model I built had a shelf life. Every answer was temporary. The organism was iterating faster than my understanding.

I thought about something I'd read in a Wikipedia article about evolution — not in the textbook, just one of those 2 AM deep dives where you start with "how fast do bacteria evolve" and end up reading about the Red Queen hypothesis. The idea is simple: in an evolutionary arms race, you have to keep running just to stay in the same place. The organism adapts, so you adapt, so it adapts again, and the race never ends. Lewis Carroll's Red Queen, telling Alice: "It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."

We were in a Red Queen race and we were losing. Not because we weren't adapting — we were. But our adaptation was cognitive, social, slow. The organism's adaptation was biological, collective, fast. We were playing chess against something that was rewriting the rules between moves.

The sun went down. The Turned shifted. Sixteen faces turned toward the last of the light. Pembrook's skin, in the steeple binoculars, was visibly green now — not the grey-green of week one but a darker, almost vegetal shade, concentrated on his face and forearms. The sun-exposed surfaces. I wrote it in the notebook and drew an arrow connecting it to the sunflower observation from week one and didn't write what I thought it meant because I wasn't ready.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #6:**

*Day 12. Moss confirmed the density threshold. Confirmed adaptation. She has more data but can't transmit it. She's sixty miles away and she's the only person I know of who's studying this systematically.*

*Dale has eighteen days of Suboxone. Jim has maybe forty days of metoprolol at current dose. Ruth has twenty-five days of atenolol. The pharmacy run bought time but time is what it bought — not a solution. When the medications run out, the people who are alive because of chemistry will have to be alive because of willpower. And willpower, unlike metoprolol, doesn't come in milligrams.*

*The old model said: stay calm and you're safe. The new model says: stay calm, stay below the density threshold, stay fed, stay medicated, and outrun an organism that's adapting faster than you are. And even then you're only safe until the next model revision tells you that "safe" was always temporary.*

*I'm starting to think the whole concept of "rules for survival" is a comfort blanket. The rules keep changing. The organism keeps learning. The only real rule is: pay attention. Revise. Don't get attached to being right.*

*Moss said "every fortress is a countdown." She's right. But what she didn't say is that every model is a countdown too.*

# Chapter 12: Nate Tells the Lyles

On Day 12, while the Moss broadcast was still settling into everyone's models, Sienna and I ran experiments.

"Experiments" makes it sound planned. It started as watching. We were on the steeple — morning shift, the two of us — and I'd been tracking the new scrub-woman's behavior for twenty minutes. She stood in the lot, face to the sun, arms at her sides. Motionless. I tossed a pen cap through the louver. It landed six feet from her. She didn't flinch. Didn't look. Didn't register the object at all.

"They don't startle," I said.

"Drop something bigger," Sienna said.

I tossed a hymnal page — crumpled, golf-ball-sized. It hit the gravel two feet from the Turned. Nothing. A gust could have done it. The Turned's eyes didn't move.

Sienna pulled off her shoe — a canvas sneaker, one of the church donation pairs — and threw it. Not at the Turned. Near her. The shoe landed with a soft thud in the gravel, three feet from the woman's bare toes.

The Turned looked down.

Not quickly — the slow, deliberate tilt. She looked at the shoe the way you'd look at a leaf that had blown onto your porch. Then she bent, picked it up, and walked to the church's side door. She set the shoe on the doorstep. Placed it there — sole down, aligned with the door frame, the way you'd return a neighbor's misdelivered package. Then she walked back to her position and faced the sun again.

Sienna and I looked at each other.

"We're not invisible," I said. "We're catalogued."

"She knew it was ours."

"She knew it came from the building. She returned it to the building's entrance. That's — that's object association. That's memory. That's the organism tracking where we are and processing our behavior in real time."

Sienna stared at the shoe on the doorstep. "She didn't come inside. She didn't try the door. She just... gave it back."

"Because we're not a threat. We're below threshold. The organism has *filed* us." I wrote it in the notebook. My hand was shaking slightly. Not from fear — from the implications. "They know exactly where we are. They've known since Jim put the sign up. And they're choosing not to act because we're more useful alive. We're fear batteries they're not ready to harvest yet."

We spent the next hour testing proximity. From the steeple we watched Jim's morning walk — his daily circuit of the parking lot, slow, calm, passing within ten feet of three Turned. No reaction. We watched a stray cat cross the lot — the Turned tracked it, the head-turn, but didn't pursue. The cat was too small to be worth the caloric effort, apparently. Or the organism didn't categorize cats as food yet.

"Marcus's question," Sienna said. "Has anyone tried killing one."

"Yeah."

"If they don't react to proximity — if you can walk right up to one and it just stands there —"

"Then the question isn't theoretical. Someone *could* walk up with a sharp object and —"

"And what? We don't know what happens. We don't know if killing one activates the others. We don't know if the organism has a defense mechanism we haven't seen."

"We don't know," I agreed. But the shoe on the doorstep was bothering me in a way I couldn't articulate. The Turned didn't flinch from objects. They didn't react to proximity. They passively allowed you to approach. It was like walking up to a machine that was turned off — until you remembered that the machine was watching you, had filed you, and had returned your shoe to your door with the casual precision of something that understood property and territory and the relationship between the two.

The passivity wasn't weakness. It was strategy. And strategy implies a response to deviation.

---

I decided to go to the Lyles on Day 13.

I need to explain what this meant because "decided to go" sounds small and it was the largest thing I'd done in my life. I had been, for thirteen days, a watcher. An observer. A recorder of other people's actions and other people's deaths. I had theories and data and a notebook full of patterns and I had done exactly nothing with any of it except survive, which is not nothing but is also not enough. Jim put a sign in the window and saved lives. I put observations in a notebook and saved myself.

And every time someone suggested I do more, I had the same ready answer: *I'm fifteen. I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds. I'm the strategy kid, not the action kid.* It came out as humor. It sounded like self-awareness. It was the most comfortable lie I owned — the one that said my limitations were fixed properties, like height or eye color, rather than choices I was making every day I stayed in the steeple with the binoculars instead of walking down the stairs.

The Moss broadcast changed the calculation. She'd confirmed the density threshold. She'd said fortification was a countdown. The Lyles' perimeter was at twenty-two Turned — I'd counted that morning — and the behavior was changing. More restless. More circling. The patient herding was giving way to something tighter, more compressed, and I could feel the threshold approaching the way you feel a storm — not in the data but in the quality of the air.

Jim had tried and failed. Marcus had tried and failed. They'd tried as adults, with authority and diplomacy, and Craig had listened respectfully and dismissed them because his mental model was stronger than their words. But Jim and Marcus didn't have the data. They had a principle — stay calm — and a principle without evidence is just an opinion, and Craig Lyle had plenty of opinions of his own.

I had the data. I had the notebook. I had Moss's broadcast transcribed in my handwriting. And I had the specific, granular, observation-by-observation record of every pattern I'd tracked for two weeks — the herding mechanics, the density changes, the behavioral shifts at concentration. I couldn't make Craig *believe.* But I could make it harder for him to dismiss.

There was something else, too. Something I didn't want to examine but I'm writing this journal to be honest, so: I wanted to go because I thought my framework was better. Jim had tried faith. Marcus had tried authority. Neither had worked. And there was a part of me — the part that had spent thirteen years being the smartest kid in the room and the least useful person in it — that thought *data* would work where faith and authority hadn't, because data was *mine*, and mine was better. The ugly word for this is vanity. The comfortable word is confidence. The honest word is somewhere between them and I hadn't found it yet.

"I'm going to the Lyles," I told the group at breakfast. Cold oatmeal, no milk. Ruth had insisted on oatmeal because "it's a proper breakfast" and nobody argued with Ruth about propriety.

Silence.

"Alone?" Jim said.

"I'm the one who understands the data. I can explain it in a way that —"

"You're fifteen," Marcus said.

"I know how old I am."

"A fifteen-year-old showing up at a sheriff's deputy's door to tell him he's wrong about survival. Think about how that lands."

"I have. It lands badly. But Jim already tried and Craig heard 'stay calm' and filed it under 'nice idea from a pastor.' I can show him the numbers. The count around his house, the rate of increase, the behavioral shift at density. I can show him Moss's broadcast. Numbers are harder to dismiss than theology."

"Craig will dismiss whatever he needs to dismiss," Marcus said. "That's how Craig works."

"Then at least I tried. And at least he had the information. What he does with it is his problem."

Sienna was watching me. She had the expression she got when I did something she didn't expect — surprise, recalculation, the quick reassessment of a model she'd built of who I was. I tried not to think about the fact that she was watching me. I failed.

"I'll walk with you to the corner of Cedar," she said. "Watch from there. If anything goes wrong —"

"If anything goes wrong, you walk back. Slowly. You don't run."

"I know how to walk, Nate."

"I know you do. I'm saying it because —"

"Because you care about what happens to me. I know." She said this flatly, factually, the way she said most things, and I felt my face get hot and looked at my oatmeal.

"Be back before noon," Jim said. "And Nate — be kind. Craig is wrong but he's not stupid and he's scared. Scared people need kindness more than data."

I nodded. I didn't tell Jim that I had no idea how to be kind under pressure. Kindness was a skill I'd never practiced. Data I could do.

---

The walk to Cedar Street took twelve minutes. Sienna and I moved together, side by side, through the residential blocks behind the church. The streets were quiet — most of the houses either empty or occupied by Turned who stood in yards and driveways in their positions. We passed a Turned man mowing a lawn with a push mower, back and forth, the blades long since jammed with overgrown grass but his body going through the motion — push, turn, push, turn — the muscle memory of a Saturday routine playing on loop. The mower's wheels squeaked. The sound was small and awful.

At the corner of Cedar, Sienna stopped. She had a rock in her hand — a smooth landscaping stone she'd picked up two blocks back. I'd watched her pick it up and hadn't asked. Now she set it on top of the mailbox at the corner, positioning it carefully.

"If they move toward you," she said, "I bang the rock on the mailbox. Hard, continuous. They orient to the noise — thirty seconds, maybe more. Enough time for you to move. I stop, walk back. They lose interest."

The hymnal experiment. She'd been in the steeple when I dropped it. She'd been watching, and she'd built a tactic from what I'd observed, and she'd brought a rock.

"You thought about this."

"One of us has to." She looked at me. "I can see the porch from this distance."

"Okay."

"Nate." She touched my arm. Brief. The second time she'd done this — the first was crossing Highway 21, when I was spiraling. Both times the contact broke something loose in my chest and I didn't know what to call it except that it was the opposite of fear. "You're doing the right thing."

"The right thing would have been doing it three days ago."

"The right thing is doing it now. Go."

I went.

---

The Lyles' house was exactly what I'd seen from the steeple, but worse up close. Plywood over every window, screwed in, professional. The generator behind the house hummed — a Honda EU2200i, the quiet model, but quiet is relative and in the silence of a dead world even a quiet generator was a beacon. The American flag hung limp in the still morning air. The yard had been raked. The porch had been swept. Someone — Tammy, probably — had placed a potted plant by the front door, a chrysanthemum in a clay pot, orange and blooming. The normalcy of it hurt.

Turned were visible. I counted: nine in the immediate vicinity of the house, standing in the street, in the neighbor's yard, on the sidewalk across the road. They tracked me as I walked up the front path. None approached. I was moving slowly. I was, according to the cuff I'd checked before leaving, at 78 BPM. Elevated but manageable.

I knocked on the door. The plywood vibrated.

The door opened six inches, chain still on. A face appeared — a woman, mid-forties, alert eyes. Tammy Lyle. She looked at me the way you'd look at a stray dog on your porch: not hostile, but confused.

"Who are you?"

"Nate Carver. I live at the trailer park. I'm with the group at Pastor Jim's church."

"Jim's boy?"

"He's not — I'm not his — I'm with his group. Can I talk to Craig?"

She looked me over. Fifteen, overweight, wearing Vacation Bible School 2019, carrying a spiral notebook. Whatever threat assessment she was running, I was not registering.

"Craig," she called back into the house. "Kid from the church."

She opened the chain. Before I stepped inside, she looked at me — not my face, but my hands, my clothes, my posture. "Are you armed?"

"No."

"Are you sick? Fever, shakes, anything?"

"No."

"Come in."

Two questions. That was Tammy's protocol — a threat assessment, not a mimicry check. *Are you armed, are you sick.* It was sensible and it was wrong and she didn't know it was wrong because she didn't know what Jim knew about the coffee and the hands and the fine motor degradation. Craig's house was checking for weapons. Jim's church was checking for humanity. The gap between those two approaches was the gap between two survival philosophies, and only one of them accounted for what the organism actually did.

The living room surprised me. Brett was on the couch cleaning a shotgun — I'd expected that. What I hadn't expected were the other people. A couple in their fifties sat at the dining table, the woman holding a mug with both hands, the man staring at the plywood-covered windows with the hollow look of someone who'd been staring at plywood for days. And near the kitchen doorway, a thin man in a trucker cap leaned against the wall with his arms crossed — young, maybe mid-twenties, with road dust on his jeans and a wariness that said he'd walked a long way to get here.

The bullhorn had worked. Not just on the Turned.

---

Craig Lyle was exactly the man I'd expected from the steeple: big, capable, composed. He wore his sheriff's department jacket like a uniform, which it was — not in the official sense anymore, but in the psychological sense, the sense that said *I am the authority here and the authority knows what to do.* He shook my hand. His grip was firm. He looked me in the eye. He was everything I wasn't: confident, physical, certain.

"Jim sent you?"

"I came on my own. I have information from a radio broadcast — a scientist at the University of Arkansas. She's studying the organism. She's describing what she's found, and some of it is relevant to your situation."

"My situation." Not defensive. Curious. The way a cop listens to a witness — gathering information, withholding judgment. I respected this. I also recognized it as a framework that was about to collide with data it couldn't accommodate.

I opened the notebook. I showed him the count: the Turned in his perimeter, plotted by day, the number climbing from eight on Day 8 to twenty-two today. I showed him the behavioral observations: the shift from passive positioning to active circling, the increased restlessness, the tightening of the perimeter.

"They're drawn to the noise," I said. "The generator, the bullhorn. Every broadcast brings more. The count has been rising by two to three per day. At this rate, in a week you'll have thirty-five to forty."

"Thirty-five. And?"

"There's a threshold. When enough of them gather in a small enough space, the behavior changes. The patient herding breaks down into — the scientist calls it a 'density threshold.' Below it, they're strategic. Above it, they become destructive. Physically destructive. They've been observed tearing through structures — plywood, drywall, framing."

Craig's expression didn't change. He was listening. He was evaluating. Brett looked up from the shotgun when I mentioned the threshold. He didn't look impressed. The couple at the table were watching me with a different expression — not dismissal but recognition. They'd seen enough to know what I was describing. The trucker had turned his face to the plywood-covered window, arms still crossed.

The man in the trucker cap spoke from the wall. "The interchange," he said. "I came through it. On 40, east of Ozark." He looked at me. "You know about it?"

"My friend was there. She saw it."

"The soldiers were defending it. Full checkpoint — barricades, vehicles, weapons. They held it for maybe four days." He paused. "On the fourth day the Turned came through the barricades like they weren't there. Not walking. Running. Screaming. The soldiers fired and every shot drew more. The noise — the guns, the shouting, the engines — it was like ringing a dinner bell. The soldiers who didn't run got —" He stopped. "The ones who ran survived. The ones who fought didn't."

The couple at the table hadn't moved. The woman's knuckles were white on her mug. She'd heard this before. She was hearing it again and it was not getting easier.

"That's one incident," Craig said from behind me. He'd been listening. "One checkpoint, one bad night. It doesn't mean —"

"It means exactly what the kid is saying," the trucker said. "Defense draws them. Noise feeds them. Every fortress is a countdown." He looked at me again. "Your friend — she said the same thing?"

"Word for word."

Craig's jaw tightened. He turned to me fully.

"Son," Craig said. "I appreciate you walking over here. I appreciate the data. But I've been in law enforcement for twenty years. I've handled armed standoffs, domestic sieges, riot situations. I know how crowds behave. And what you're describing — staying quiet, hiding, hoping they go away — that's not a survival strategy. That's waiting to die."

"It's not hiding. It's understanding the mechanism. The organism responds to biochemistry — to your stress hormones. When you fight, when you use the bullhorn, when Brett fires the shotgun, you're broadcasting exactly the signal that draws them in and pushes the count toward the threshold. Every act of defense is accelerating the countdown."

"Every act of defense is keeping my family alive."

"For now. The count is growing. The threshold exists. When it tips —"

"If it tips."

"When." I held his eyes. This was the hardest thing I'd ever done — harder than the crossing, harder than Henderson's trailer, harder than the septic tank I didn't know was coming. Because this wasn't about my body surviving. This was about making another person hear something their brain was built to reject. "Craig, you're not wrong about any of the individual pieces. The boards work. The guns work. The perimeter works. But the system you've built is a magnet for the thing that overwhelms the system. The better your defenses, the more they come. The more they come, the closer to threshold. The closer to threshold —"

"I heard you." His voice had an edge now. Not anger — the frustration of a competent man being told by a child that competence is the problem. "And I hear what you're not saying, which is that you want me to take down the boards and turn off the generator and put away the guns and just — sit in the dark. Like your church group."

"I want you to stop drawing them to your house. Turn off the generator at night. Stop the bullhorn. Reduce the signals. If the count drops below —"

"And if it doesn't drop? If they stay? If more come anyway? Then I've given up my power and my light and my ability to defend my family and I'm sitting in the dark with nothing. Is that what you're recommending?"

Brett racked the shotgun's slide — not loading it, just cycling the action, the mechanical sound of a statement being made. "This is the kid from the trailer park. The one who plays video games." He said "video games" the way you'd say "finger-painting." "He's here to tell us how to survive? Dad, come on."

I looked at Brett. He was everything the apocalypse was supposed to reward: strong, brave, young, capable. He could run faster than me, fight harder, lift more, endure more. In every survival scenario except this one, Brett Lyle would outlive me by decades. In this one, his strengths were the mechanism of his destruction.

"I'm not telling you how to survive," I said to Craig. "I'm telling you what's happening to your perimeter. What you do with the information is your decision."

Tammy had been standing in the kitchen doorway, listening. She hadn't said a word. She looked at me now with an expression that was harder to read than Craig's or Brett's — not dismissal, not agreement, but a specific kind of attention that I'd seen on Sienna's face when Sienna was evaluating something she hadn't decided about yet.

"The count," Tammy said. "You said twenty-two. You've been tracking it?"

"Every day. From the church steeple."

"And the ones near the church?"

"Sixteen. But we're not generating noise. We're not broadcasting. The growth rate near the church is lower than near your house."

Tammy looked at Craig. Something passed between them — the compressed communication of a long marriage, an entire argument conducted in eye contact. Craig's jaw tightened. Tammy's didn't change.

"Thank you, Nate," Craig said. The dismissal was polite. Complete. He walked me to the door. He shook my hand again. "Tell Jim I appreciate the concern. We'll be fine."

The door closed.

I stood on the porch next to Tammy's chrysanthemum and felt the specific sting of being dismissed by a man who was wrong, and then — under it, quieter — the recognition that this was exactly how Craig had felt when Jim tried. And how Jim might feel when I explained things to him. The vanity I'd carried here — *my data is better than your faith, my framework is sharper than your training* — had produced exactly the same result as every other approach. Craig's model was intact. Mine had a crack in it. The crack was this: being right and being persuasive had nothing to do with each other, and I'd confused them because confusing them let me feel superior, and feeling superior was the thing I'd been doing instead of being useful for thirteen years.

---

I walked back to the corner of Cedar. Sienna was there, leaning against a mailbox, watching the road. She saw my face.

"He didn't listen."

"He listened. He didn't hear."

"What's the difference?"

"Listening is receiving information. Hearing is letting it change you. Craig received the information and then his brain routed it through his existing model and the model said 'this kid is wrong because what he's describing contradicts everything I know about how to protect people,' and the information died somewhere between his ears and his behavior."

We walked back to the church. Sienna didn't touch my arm this time. She walked beside me and the space between us was comfortable in a way it hadn't been a week ago and I noticed this and filed it and did not examine it because examining it would raise my heart rate and raising my heart rate was, as established, inadvisable.

"You tried," she said.

"Trying doesn't count if it doesn't work."

"That's not true and you know it."

"I know it intellectually. I don't know it in my body."

She looked at me sideways. "That might be the most honest thing you've ever said."

---

I'd started dreading sleep. Not for what I saw — the dreams were bad, the trailer dream, the Knock on loop, variations I won't catalog — but for the waking. There's a moment between sleep and consciousness, maybe two seconds, when you don't remember where you are or what the world has become. And in those two seconds your body startles — the orienting reflex, *Brunner & Suddarth* calls it — and your heart rate spikes before your brain catches up. Two seconds of uncontrolled fear. In the old world, harmless. In this world, a conversion risk. I'd started sleeping with my hand on my pulse, thumb pressed against the artery in my wrist, so that the first thing I felt on waking was my own heartbeat, and the first conscious act was counting it down. It was not a good way to sleep. It was the way I slept now.

At the church, I sat in the steeple and counted the Turned around the Lyles' house through the binoculars. Twenty-three now. One more since this morning. Brett was on the porch, shotgun across his knees, watching the perimeter. Craig was checking the boards on the north-facing windows. Tammy was nowhere visible.

I opened the notebook.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #7:**

*I told them the truth and they didn't believe me. Not because it's not true but because it's a truth that requires you to do the opposite of what feels right. Every instinct says fortify, arm, defend. Every instinct is wrong. And telling someone their instincts are wrong is the same as telling them they're wrong, and people don't hear that. They can't. The brain protects itself from information that threatens its model the way the immune system protects itself from infection — automatically, aggressively, without conscious input.*

*Cognitive dissonance isn't a flaw. It's a feature. The brain evolved to maintain coherent models because coherent models are faster than accurate ones, and in the ancestral environment, speed mattered more than accuracy. A caveman who reacts instantly to a wrong model survives more often than one who pauses to revise. The problem is that we're not in the ancestral environment anymore. We're in a novel environment where the wrong model kills you, and the brain is still optimizing for speed.*

*I don't know how to make people revise their models. Jim can't do it with faith. I can't do it with data. Maybe nobody can do it with words. Maybe the only thing that revises a model is the model failing — and by then it's too late.*

*Tammy listened differently than Craig. She asked about numbers. She asked about our count. I think she's running her own calculations and I think her calculations are arriving at the same place mine are. Whether she can make Craig hear what she's hearing — that's their marriage, their dynamic, their version of the prisoner's dilemma. Cooperate or hold the line. I gave them the information. What happens next is outside my control.*

*I keep thinking about what Jim said: "Being right doesn't give you the right to let him die without trying." He was talking to me. He was also talking about himself. He was also talking about God, probably. Jim talks about several things at once and you don't always know until later.*

*The Lyles have attracted other survivors. A couple from the subdivisions, a trucker from the highway. The bullhorn works both ways — it draws Turned and it draws people, and Craig doesn't distinguish between the two functions because both confirm his model. More people = more strength. He's right in every world except this one.*

*The trucker was at the interchange. He confirmed what Sienna described — the checkpoint fell because the defense attracted the attack. The soldiers who fought died. The soldiers who ran survived. He said it to Craig's face and Craig heard it and filed it away the way Craig files everything: "one bad night." The machinery of disbelief is remarkable. You can pile data on it and it doesn't break. It just categorizes.*

*Day 13. Twenty-three Turned around the Lyles. Sixteen around the church. The gap between those numbers is a measurement of the difference between being heard and being loud. I don't know which number will reach threshold first. I'm afraid I do.*
