# Chapter 1: The Sick Day

Here is a fact about me: I am fifteen years old, I weigh approximately one hundred and eighty pounds, and on the night the world ended I was six hours into a *Civilization VI* marathon as Gilgamesh of Sumeria because his War-Cart is overpowered in the Ancient Era and I needed something in my life to go well.

I was home sick. I was not sick.

I'd told my mom my stomach hurt that morning — seven AM, school-day voice, the performance of a lifetime — which she didn't believe because she's an ER nurse and can spot a fake symptom the way a mechanic can spot a bad alternator. She put her hand on my forehead, already knowing I was lying, decided the fight wasn't worth it, and left me a Sprite and a sleeve of Saltines on the counter. Then she went back to bed because she works nights and sleeps days, and I spent the next ten hours doing exactly what I would have done at school, which is nothing, except horizontally and with better WiFi.

By late afternoon she was up, dressed, packing her scrub bag. "I'm on at six. There's leftover pasta in the fridge. Don't stay up all night."

"I won't," I said, which we both knew was a lie but a small enough one that it didn't matter.

She left at 5:45 because she's always early. Night shift at Johnson Regional — four years now, Friday through Monday, twelve hours, because the differential pay is better and because, she says, "somebody has to be there when normal people are sleeping." We live in a single-wide in Shady Oaks Mobile Home Park off Highway 21, north of town toward the national forest. The night differential is the difference between a single-wide and sleeping in her car. She comes home smelling like hand sanitizer and talks about her patients in words I only half understand. Triage. Bolus. Lactated Ringer's.

At the door she did the thing she always does on Fridays. She turned back and pointed at me — just pointed, a little acknowledgment of our routine — and said, "Happy Friday, bud."

"Happy Friday," I said, not looking up from my screen.

She left.

I've replayed that moment more times than I've replayed anything in my life. I was on the couch. Laptop open. Half-eaten bag of Doritos on the cushion next to me, orange dust on the trackpad. My mom said "Happy Friday, bud" and I said "Happy Friday" and I didn't look up.

I didn't look up.

That's not the important part of the story. But it's the part I can't stop thinking about.

By 11 PM I'd pushed past the Medieval Era and was working on a domination victory — conquer everybody. It's all positioning and logistics and knowing when to push and when to consolidate. I'm going to be explaining a lot of things in detail going forward and you should probably get used to it.

The trailer was quiet the way it always is on Friday nights — just me and the furnace and the thin walls. I could hear Mr. Pembrook's TV two units down, the occasional car on Highway 21, and the dogs at the far end of the park who bark at everything.

Our trailer is a 1998 Fleetwood, two bedroom, one bath, with wood-grain paneling that hasn't been wood-grain since Clinton was president and a kitchen where the counter is eighteen inches from the stove. The lot is gravel. The skirting is vinyl. The walls are charitably insulated — you can hear your neighbor sneeze but at least you can't feel the wind.

I'm describing this because later the geography of this park — seventeen occupied units in a U-shape off a gravel drive, community laundry building at the entrance, dumpster enclosure at the back, Highway 21 on one side and a wooded hillside on the other — becomes the most important map I ever study. I need you to see it now, while it's still just a place where people live cheap and keep to themselves.

At 11:14 PM I heard sirens. Multiple. Not the single wail of an ambulance heading to Johnson Regional, which is basically white noise here — Highway 64 is the ambulance corridor and we're close enough to hear it. This was layered. Three, four vehicles from different directions, overlapping, close and then far and then close again. I paused the game because the sound was interfering with my concentration, which tells you everything you need to know about my priorities at that moment.

My phone buzzed. AP News notification:

**PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECLARED IN MULTIPLE STATES — Details developing**

I opened it. The article was three facts and twelve paragraphs of nothing — something about "unexplained behavioral episodes," the CDC "coordinating with state health departments," citizens advised to shelter in place. The rest was filler. "Experts are monitoring the situation." "The White House released a statement expressing concern." Journalist code for: we know as much as you do, which is nothing, but we have to keep typing or they'll make us go outside.

I turned on the TV, which I should have done first, and which I'm telling you about second because I want to be honest about the order in which I processed the end of the world: phone, then Reddit, then television, because I am a child of my generation and the TV is my mom's thing and I literally had to look for the remote for three minutes before I found it under a couch cushion.

Local news was running continuous coverage, which sounds dramatic but mostly meant two anchors sitting at a desk looking increasingly uncomfortable while repeating the same five facts in different arrangements. Schools closed in the morning. The hospital was on diversion — no new patients. The National Guard had been activated, which they illustrated with stock footage of Humvees that could have been from any year. Between repetitions, they cut to reporters in other cities — Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles — all saying the same thing: something is happening, it's happening everywhere, nobody knows what it is.

One segment from a station in Dallas showed cell phone footage of a man in a Walmart parking lot eating raw ground beef out of the package, standing upright, methodical, his face blank. The anchors cut away from it quickly. Nobody commented on it. It was just one more piece of the montage of wrongness, and at the time I didn't realize it was the most important thing they'd shown all night.

The global scope was the only real news, and it was staggering if you stopped to think about it. I didn't. At fifteen, "worldwide" is a word on a map. Three blocks is where you live.

I switched to Reddit. The front page was already a disaster. A megathread on r/all — "What is happening? Reports of mass behavioral changes worldwide" — had 30,000 upvotes and climbing. I scrolled. It was the same report over and over: *My neighbor is standing in his yard and won't respond. There are people outside who aren't moving. I saw someone get chased and then they just stopped and joined them.* Identical accounts from Portland and Houston and London and Lagos, ten thousand variations on the same three sentences.

A few posts were different — stranger, harder to process. Someone in rural Oregon described affected individuals "gathering around a cattle trough and drinking from it like animals." A woman in suburban Atlanta posted that the man standing in her cul-de-sac had walked to her bird feeder, pulled out the seed tray, and eaten the contents, then gone back to standing. A man in rural Kentucky wrote that an affected person had broken through his kitchen window at 3 AM — not stumbled into it, not walked through an open door, but punched through the glass and climbed in over the sink and eaten everything in the refrigerator and then left through the same window. "It wasn't random," he wrote. "It was like he was looking for something." This one was downvoted. People didn't want it. It didn't fit the standing-still narrative, the passive narrative, the "just avoid them and they leave you alone" narrative that everyone was building because that narrative was the comfortable one. I scrolled past it too. I shouldn't have.

The conspiracy theories were growing like mold. In the first two hundred comments I counted: Chinese bioweapon, Russian bioweapon, 5G activation, Bill Gates depopulation agenda, punishment from God for gay marriage, punishment from God for not allowing gay marriage, nanobots in the water supply, leaked government experiment, mass formation psychosis, aliens, something about immigrants, something about Elon Musk, and — this one I remember because it was all caps — "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LET THEM TAKE THE GUNS." Everyone was explaining the thing they didn't understand by blaming the people they already hated. Nobody was describing what was actually happening because nobody knew what was actually happening, so they described their fears instead and called it information.

This is what people do when the world stops making sense: they fill it in with whatever was already in their heads. A blank coloring book, everyone with their own crayons.

I wasn't any different. I had my own coloring book and my own crayons, and they were all labeled with things I'd absorbed from movies and games and late-night Wikipedia spirals. Some kind of virus, I figured. A fast-acting neurological thing — prion disease, maybe, or a weaponized pathogen. The affected people were sick. They were confused. They'd be disoriented for a while and then the CDC would figure it out and there'd be a vaccine or a treatment and the news cycle would move on. That was my framework: this is a medical emergency, it's scary but temporary, the adults with the degrees and the hazmat suits will handle it. Shelter in place meant wait it out. The system was overwhelmed but the system was still there.

I held onto that framework for about thirty-six more hours. It was wrong in every particular, but it was comfortable, and comfort is the thing you give up last.

I didn't find anything useful. I went back to my game.

Twenty minutes later I heard gunshots.

Not close — maybe a mile, maybe more, past Highway 21 toward the interstate. But distinct: the flat crack of a handgun, rapid, five or six shots. Then nothing. Then, from a different direction, more — a heavier sound, a rifle, three deliberate pops. In Arkansas you hear guns. Hunting season, target practice, someone shooting a copperhead in their yard. It's background noise. But this wasn't the right pattern. Hunting rifles are spaced — one shot, pause, one shot. Target practice is rhythmic. This was urgent. This was someone shooting at something they were afraid of, which is a different sound entirely, and I knew the difference even though I'd never consciously thought about it before.

My brain went straight to the movies. Barricade the doors. Find weapons. Head for the roof. Shoot anything that shuffles. That's the playbook for this, right? That's what you do when the sick people start walking around and the government says shelter in place. You board up and hold out and eventually the National Guard rolls in with Humvees and bullhorns. I'd seen this movie. Everybody's seen this movie.

The dogs at the end of the park were going insane. Barking, howling, the frantic kind that means something is wrong in a way that dogs understand and people pretend not to.

I paused the game. I went to the kitchen window. Our trailer faces the gravel drive, and from the kitchen I can see past the laundry building to Highway 21. The road was empty. The streetlight at the park entrance was on, throwing its orange cone across the asphalt. Nothing was moving.

The gunshots didn't repeat. The dogs eventually stopped — not wound down, not tapered off. Stopped. All of them, within a few seconds of each other, mid-bark, as if something had arrived at their end of the park that was worse than whatever they'd been barking at.

The silence after was a different kind of silence. The hair on my arms stood up — all of it, at once — and my stomach turned over slow and heavy. I stood at the kitchen window and didn't move and barely breathed. I couldn't have told you what I was afraid of. But my body knew.

I went back to the couch.

On my desk, under the Doritos bag, was last month's issue of *Popular Science*. Cover story: Comet Voss and the unusually bright meteor showers it produced when Earth passed through the edge of its tail in September. I'd read the article during a 2 AM Wikipedia rabbit hole — one of those where you start with "what's the fastest animal" and end up reading about the Oort Cloud and panspermia, which is the theory that life on Earth might have originally arrived on comets and meteoroids. A legitimate scientific hypothesis with real evidence behind it. I thought the comet article was cool. I mentioned it to exactly no one. I had already forgotten about it.

I should not have forgotten about it.

But that comes later. Right now it's 2 AM on a Saturday morning in October in Arkansas, and I'm falling asleep on a couch with a laptop on my chest and a mouth that tastes like Doritos, and outside, past the gravel lot and the dark tree line, the world is quietly ending, and I don't know yet.
