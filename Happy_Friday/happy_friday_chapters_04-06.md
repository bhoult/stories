# Chapter 4: The Knock

I spent the afternoon reading my mom's nursing textbook.

This needs context. My mom kept two textbooks from her associate's degree on a shelf above the washer-dryer unit: *Fundamentals of Nursing* and *Brunner & Suddarth's Medical-Surgical Nursing*, which is the size and weight of a cinder block. She'd never gotten rid of them because, she said, "Nursing school was the hardest thing I ever did and those books are my trophies." I'd never opened them.

But by Day 2 my phone was dead and the TV was off and I'd read every magazine in the house and I was alone in a box with nothing to do with my brain, and the textbooks were there. I pulled *Brunner & Suddarth* off the shelf and started reading about the autonomic nervous system because the alternative was sitting in the dark replaying the sound of Lisa Anderson screaming.

I didn't understand half of it. I understood enough. The sympathetic nervous system ran on chemicals: epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol. Produced by the adrenal glands in response to perceived threat. The system was involuntary — you didn't choose to activate it any more than you chose to digest food. I read about beta-blockers. I read about the feedback loop between the amygdala and the hypothalamus — the cycle where fear triggers chemicals that trigger more fear.

---

That night I learned the worst thing about them.

It was dark. I was in the hallway with *Brunner & Suddarth* open on the floor beside me and a flashlight I wasn't using because light is visible through thin walls.

The knock came at 10:47 PM. Three knocks. Front door. Polite.

"Nate? Honey? Your mama asked me to check on you."

Lisa Anderson's exact voice — the nasal quality, the stretched vowel in "mama." I had watched her turn six hours ago. Whatever was on the porch was using her voice the way you'd use a key — testing it against a lock.

"Nate, are you in there? I brought you some dinner."

The details were right. Lisa knew my mom worked at the hospital. Lisa had actually brought us food before. The organism had access to her memory and was selecting the approach most likely to trigger my response — not fear but something deeper. Trust. Need. The textbook would call it targeted stimulus manipulation. Familiar voices activate the brain's reward pathways before the cortex can evaluate them. The organism wasn't trying to fool my thinking brain. It was reaching for the layer underneath.

Knowing this did not help. Each approach landed differently in my chest.

Then it stopped. Ten seconds of silence.

When it came back, it wasn't Lisa's anymore.

"Nate? Baby? It's Mom. I'm home."

---

I put my hand over my mouth and bit down hard enough to leave marks. The sound trying to come out of me would have carried through the walls.

"I got off early. The roads were bad but I made it. Open the door, bud."

It was perfect. The warmth. The tiredness underneath. The pause before "bud."

"I brought Chick-fil-A. Come on, open up."

She doesn't bring Chick-fil-A. She brings Whataburger. Mom turns left out of the Johnson Regional Medical Center parking lot, passes the Taco Bell, and a mile down hits the Whataburger. Patty melt with jalapeños and a Dr Pepper. Every time. The closest Chick-fil-A is twenty-five minutes away in Russellville — Lisa Anderson's commute, not Mom's. Lisa drove to Russellville for work. The organism was using Lisa's neural architecture to puppet Mom's voice, and Lisa's brain associated "bringing dinner home" with the Chick-fil-A she passed every day on 64. The organism didn't know the difference. It grabbed the strongest food-plus-homecoming association it could find and it grabbed the wrong woman's.

The only reason I didn't open the door was a fast food restaurant. The margin between surviving and not is the difference between a Whataburger and a Chick-fil-A. I am fifteen years old and I am alive because an alien organism used the wrong woman's memory of a drive-through, and if you think you'd do better — if you think your logic would hold when the voice on the other side of the door is the only person in the world you want to see — then you don't understand what this is.

"Happy Friday, bud."

Her exact voice. The inflection that rises on "Friday" and falls on "bud." I cried without making a sound. The thing on the porch said it again — "Happy Friday, bud" — and again — like a record skipping. It didn't understand that the reason the key fit was the same reason the door would never open.

Forty-five minutes. 10:47 to 11:32.

I sat for another hour. Then I washed my hand. The bite was deep — human mouths are bacterial ecosystems, infection rate above 10%. *Brunner & Suddarth*, chapter on wound management. My mom would have cleaned it properly. She would have said "Nate, honestly" in that exasperated voice, and fixed it.

I wrote in the notebook:

*She used Mom's voice. They access memories. The mimicry is targeted — the stimulus most likely to provoke a response. It's not cruelty. It's optimization. They find the thing you miss most and they put it on the other side of a door.*

*I miss her so much I can't breathe and the thing that used her voice knows that.*

I did not sleep. I want to be precise about the not-sleeping, because it wasn't a choice — it was a condition. My brain had the Knock on a loop and the loop had no off switch. Forty-five minutes of audio, start to finish, playing behind my eyes every time I closed them. Lisa's voice. Then Mom's voice. "Happy Friday, bud." The inflection rising on "Friday," falling on "bud." Over and over. I tried to think about something else — the textbook, the observations, the mechanism — and my mind returned to the loop the way a compass needle returns to north. Not because I wanted it. Because the needle doesn't care what you want.

Sometime around 3 AM I realized the loop itself was dangerous. Each replay spiked something in my chest — not full panic, but a cousin of it, a low sustained hum of cortisol that the textbook would call "chronic stress activation." The organism didn't need to scare me all at once. It could do it in installments. Play the voice, let the chemistry build, play it again. The Knock wasn't just an attempt to get me to open the door. It was a deposit. A seed planted in the replay machinery of a brain that couldn't stop replaying. The organism was patient. My brain was doing its work for it, for free, in the dark.

I pressed my palms against my eyes and counted backward from a hundred by sevens. A cognitive interrupt — the kind of task that forces the prefrontal cortex to override the amygdala. It worked, partly. The loop dimmed to background noise. It didn't stop.

# Chapter 5: The Playlist

Day three. Monday. I was supposed to be in Mrs. Tillman's class making a poster about the Louisiana Purchase with Braden Cooke. The thought arrived absurd and complete, like finding a receipt from a country that doesn't exist anymore.

My hand was swollen where I'd bitten it. Red-streaked, hot to the touch. I cleaned it with dish soap and wrapped it in a clean sock. *Brunner & Suddarth* said untreated bite wounds progress to cellulitis in 24-48 hours. I needed antibiotics. I needed a world that still had pharmacies.

I ate cold SpaghettiOs from the can and read more of the textbook. My hand throbbed. The fever made the words swim if I read too long, so I read in bursts — ten minutes on, ten minutes staring at the ceiling.

I kept coming back to the window. Seventeen occupied lots in the park. Some of those people were still alive — I'd seen curtains move, heard a toilet flush through the thin walls. Each of us hiding alone. Each of us running out of food alone. Each of us watching alone.

There's a concept in game theory called the prisoner's dilemma — I know about it from a Wikipedia binge at 2 AM one night, the kind where you start with "what's the fastest animal" and end up reading about Cold War nuclear strategy. Two prisoners, each deciding independently whether to cooperate or defect. If both cooperate, both get a decent outcome. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector walks free and the cooperator gets the worst possible result. If both defect, both get a penalty — not as bad as being the sucker, but worse than if they'd trusted each other.

The math is ugly. In a single round, the only rational move is to defect. Whatever the other player does, you're better off betraying. This is why it's a dilemma — rationality leads to a worse outcome than trust would. The thing that changes the math is repetition. In an *iterated* prisoner's dilemma — the same players, over and over — cooperation becomes viable because the future matters. The winning strategy is called tit-for-tat: cooperate first, then mirror whatever the other player does, and forgive quickly. Trust built on repetition. The long game rewarding the risk of the first move.

I was living inside the dilemma. Seventeen lots, seventeen prisoners, each making the calculation: risk contact or stay safe alone? In a single round — one encounter with a stranger — defecting is rational. But this wasn't a single round. We were all going to be here tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that, and the people who cooperated early would build the networks that kept them alive later, and the people who stayed hidden would run out of food and medicine and watch-hours and die rational and alone.

I couldn't solve it from the inside. I wrote it in the notebook and put a star next to it and the star didn't help.

---

I watched the park. The Turned had multiplied — eleven now, some familiar, some drifted in from Highway 21. They stood in a pattern that covered the exits: drive, gaps between trailers, the route to the road. A net.

I started the list. At the top of a new page: **PLAYLIST.** Not because it was a playlist but because naming things makes them manageable.

Column one: name. Column two: what they were doing when they turned. Column three: behavior after.

Most entries said "unknown" in column two. I'd only witnessed one turning directly. But the pattern was there: everyone who turned was afraid. Everyone unafraid was untouched. Pastor Jim across Highway 21 walked between his house and the church every day and nothing happened to him. The variable wasn't location. It was something about the quality of his movement.

The textbook had given me the vocabulary. The observations had given me the pattern. What I didn't have was the threshold — the line between safe and gone. And I couldn't get it from a window.

---

Part of me was still waiting. I knew the bite theory was wrong. I knew they ate and maintained and weren't going to collapse. I knew the fear mechanism was the key. But underneath all of that — underneath the notebook entries and the textbook citations and the careful observations — there was still a fifteen-year-old kid who believed the adults were going to fix this. The National Guard had been activated. FEMA was posting advisories. Somewhere out there, people with authority and resources and plans were working the problem, and all I had to do was stay alive long enough for them to reach me. That was still the story I was telling myself on Day Three. It was the last comfortable story I had.

I made my first mistake at 3:15 PM.

The laundry building had a flat roof with a maintenance ladder on the back. From up there I'd see the entire park — 360 degrees. Eighty feet of gravel between me and the ladder.

I watched the route for an hour. Two Turned visible, neither between me and the building. Clear path.

Here is what I did not account for: a hundred and eighty pounds on gravel is not quiet. I knew this in theory. Theory and practice are separated by the distance between reading about fire and putting your hand in it.

Each step was a crunch. By twenty feet the Turned had oriented toward me. By thirty I saw a third one in the laundry building's shadow that I'd missed from the window. I should have turned back. I didn't, because I was fifteen and being fifteen means your risk assessment is permanently compromised by your ego, and that is a fact that has killed more people than any virus.

I made it to the ladder. I was breathing hard — not the distance but the weight. My heart was hammering in my ears and I was sweating despite the cold. Three Turned were walking toward me. That steady two miles an hour. And they were making a sound — a low vibrating drone, resonant in the chest. A summoning call. *Come here. Something's happening.*

I ran. Gravel like gunshots under my feet. Knocked a propane tank — a clang like a bell. More of them appearing between trailers, drawn by the noise. I was a parade of panic, a hundred and eighty pounds of proof that the thing they respond to is exactly the thing I was producing.

I couldn't reach my trailer. Two between me and it. I veered toward Henderson's place, saw the gap between skirting and ground, and my body threw itself flat before my brain gave permission.

Here is what happens when a hundred and eighty pounds of teenager dives for an eighteen-inch gap between vinyl skirting and gravel: the stomach hits first. Not the hands, not the chest — the stomach, because that's where the weight is, and the weight is what gravity cares about. The impact compressed everything in my abdomen upward and I vomited — instantly, violently, the cold SpaghettiOs from six hours ago coming up in a hot rush across the dead leaves and my own forearms. I didn't stop moving. You can vomit and crawl simultaneously; I learned this the way I learn everything, by doing it wrong in real time. The skirting's raw edge caught my back as I scraped under — a vinyl lip with an aluminum rail behind it — and I felt it open the skin along my shoulder blade in a line that was either three inches or six inches long; I couldn't tell and it didn't matter because I was under the trailer and nothing else mattered.

---

Seven hours under Mr. Henderson's trailer.

Eighteen inches of clearance. Face in dead leaves and mud and my own vomit, which I'd crawled through and was now lying in. Can't roll over. Can't sit up. Every movement produced sound — the crinkle of leaves, the wet shift of mud, the scrape of my jacket against the trailer's underside. I learned to breathe without moving my chest, pulling air in shallow sips, because even the rise and fall of my ribs made the leaves rustle.

Through the lattice skirting I could see feet — bare, shoed, standing in a loose cluster. Four, then six, then more. The drone continued for the first hour, drawing them in.

At one point a face appeared at the gap in the skirting. Upside down. Someone bending to look. I pressed my face into the mud and stopped breathing and the face was there for ten seconds and then withdrew. They couldn't reach me. They didn't try to tear the skirting off. This was important data — in small numbers, they didn't dismantle structures. They herded, they waited, they applied pressure. But they didn't attack.

I stored this.

It got dark. Temperature dropped — low forties. Mud soaked through my clothes. I started shaking so hard my teeth rattled. Something wet was spreading across my back — the cut from the skirting, or condensation dripping from the trailer's underside, or both. I couldn't see it and I couldn't reach it and I couldn't tell if the warmth was blood or the cold was water and after a while I stopped trying to distinguish them. The ground under me was wet too — mud, certainly, but also something else, a sharper smell underneath the mud-smell, and I realized I was lying near what was probably a sewage line connection, and the wetness seeping through my shirt might be mud or might be something I was choosing not to name. My hand throbbed where I'd bitten it, the infection spreading its warmth into skin that was otherwise freezing, which was a horrible kind of irony — the only warm part of me was the part that was dying.

Sometime around hour three my thinking started to go sideways. Not panic — something quieter, more insidious. The cold and the dark and the immobility were doing something to my rational brain, loosening its grip. I started believing things I wanted to believe. Mom was fine — she'd locked herself in the supply closet at Johnson Regional, the one she'd pointed out to me once during a tour, the one with the deadbolt. She was in there right now with water and supplies and she was waiting for me. I was going to crawl out of here and walk home and she'd be there. The cavalry was coming. The National Guard was staging outside town, waiting for daylight. By morning there'd be Humvees on Highway 21 and people with bullhorns and someone would wrap me in a blanket. These weren't hopes. They were certainties — my brain manufacturing them with the same conviction it usually reserved for things I'd actually observed. The cold was killing my ability to tell the difference between what I wanted and what was real, and the things I wanted were flooding in through the gap.

I caught myself. Not completely — you can't completely override a brain that's hypothermic and terrified and lying in its own vomit. But I caught enough of it to recognize what was happening: my rationality was failing, and the failure felt like comfort, and the comfort was a trap. The same trap the Turned used — not the grin, not the herding, but the deeper one. The one where your own mind offers you a story that feels better than the truth, and you take it because the truth is mud and cold and eighteen inches of clearance and the sound of something chewing in the dark.

I held onto the data. The notebook entries. The observations. Pembrook's face. Lisa's scream. The mechanism. I held onto them like handholds and I didn't let the comfortable lies wash them away, and it was the hardest thing I'd ever done, harder than the cold, harder than the crawl, because the lies were warm and the truth was freezing.

But the cold did something I didn't expect. It killed the panic. Not immediately — the first hour I was terrified. But as hypothermia crept in, the fear receded. My body redirected every resource to not freezing, and it turns out fear and cold compete for the same energy and cold wins. By hour five my emotional range had narrowed to a single point: *survive this minute.* No future. No past. Just mud and cold and the need to keep shaking because shaking meant my body was still trying.

The Turned drifted away in ones and twos. By 2 AM the gravel was quiet.

I crawled out. My muscles had locked. Every movement was clarifying pain. My back burned where the skirting had cut me, and my arms were cross-hatched with scratches from the gravel and the lattice frame, and the vomit had dried in my hair and on my forearms. I walked back to my trailer — not ran, *walked* — through the gap between the dumpster enclosure and the back fence. The gravel crunched and I went slow enough that each step was a single small sound, and no heads turned.

Cold shower in the dark. The mud ran off in grey rivulets. The water over the cut on my back made me hiss through my teeth. Blood and dirt and things I didn't want to identify swirled down the drain. I sat on the shower floor and shook.

After, wrapped in every blanket I owned, sitting on the bathroom floor with *Brunner & Suddarth* open on my knees, I wrote:

**JOURNAL ENTRY #1:**

*Don't go somewhere you haven't watched first. Don't assume empty means empty. Don't assume your body can do things it can't.*

*But the real thing: when I was frozen and couldn't panic, they lost interest. When I walked slow in the dark, they ignored me. The state of my body is the variable. Not the location. Not the proximity. The body.*

*Brunner & Suddarth chapter 6: "The stress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis." The HPA axis. Three organs that decide whether you live or die based on chemical signals you can't consciously control. I am fifteen years old and I am alive because hypothermia accidentally suppressed my HPA axis. The textbook calls this "cold-induced sympatholytic effect." I call it the worst night of my life, and I learned more from it than from everything else combined.*

*My hand is bad. I need antibiotics. I need someone who knows what they're doing. I need Mom.*

# Chapter 6: Day Four, or How I Met Sienna

I woke on the bathroom floor with a dead arm and a fever. The bite on my hand was swollen, red-streaked, hot. Cellulitis — the textbook was right about the timeline. I cleaned it with dish soap and wrapped it in a fresh sock and thought about the word *sepsis* and decided not to think about the word *sepsis*.

I was at the kitchen window eating peanut butter from the jar when the back door opened.

No knock. No warning. The handle turned and a girl was standing in the doorway with her hands raised, palms out. She was tall, lean, dark-skinned, hair pulled back in a knot, wearing track pants and a CLARKSVILLE PANTHERS hoodie. Her eyes were wide and her breath was fast but controlled — scared, not panicking.

"Don't scream," she whispered.

I was holding a spatula. I had grabbed it instinctively when the door opened, because apparently my survival reflexes had the tactical sophistication of a line cook. I was standing in mud-stained clothes with a swollen hand wrapped in a sock and a fever and a spatula, and Sienna Okafor was looking at me, and I became aware — in the sudden, devastating way that you become aware of these things when you're fifteen — that I looked ridiculous. Not just currently. Fundamentally. The kind of ridiculous that exists at the level of the soul.

"You're Nate," she said. "Delia's kid."

"Yeah."

My voice cracked. I am not going to pretend my voice didn't crack. I am going to be honest about everything in this journal and that includes the fact that my voice cracked when a girl spoke to me on Day 4 of the apocalypse because puberty doesn't pause for the end of the world.

She came in and closed the door — quietly, pressing it shut so the latch didn't click. She stood in my kitchen. I stood in my kitchen holding a spatula. We looked at each other and neither of us knew what to say because there is no social protocol for meeting your neighbor during the extinction of the human species.

"How did you get here?"

"Between the skirting panels. There's a gap between your trailer and Mrs. Watts's — you can move between lots under the trailers. I've been watching you."

"Watching me?"

"Watching everybody. You're the only one who watches back."

---

Sienna Okafor was seventeen. She ran the 400 and 800 for Clarksville High — state finals good, scholarship-talk good. Her parents had driven to Oklahoma City to get her brother Jaylen on Friday night. They hadn't come back.

She'd done what I'd done: watched. But she'd watched with different eyes. She could read the Turned's gait — which ones had been athletes, which ones were new arrivals based on coordination changes. She saw transitions where I saw positions. We were the same instrument tuned to different frequencies.

She was also the most distractingly present person I had ever been in a room with, and by "distractingly present" I mean that my brain, which had been functioning as a passable survival computer for four days, immediately downgraded to a calculator with a dead battery. She moved through my kitchen with the economy of someone who'd spent her life in motion and I kept losing my train of thought mid-sentence because she'd turn her head or shift her weight and some useless ancient part of my brain would say *hey notice this* and I would notice it and then I'd forget what I was saying and have to start over and she'd look at me with an expression that said she knew exactly what was happening and was choosing not to comment on it, which was worse.

I am fifteen. I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds. I have never been on a date or kissed anyone or had a conversation with a girl that lasted more than two minutes without me finding a reason to leave. I am aware that this is not the time. I am aware that there are monsters outside and my mother is missing and something I don't understand is turning people into blank-faced herding machines. I am aware of all of this, and none of it matters to the part of my brain that has noticed that Sienna Okafor has very nice collarbones, and I would like that part of my brain to shut up, and it will not shut up, and so I am going to ignore it and focus on survival and hope that nobody ever reads this paragraph.

---

She had supplies from a Dollar General run — first aid, batteries, canned food. And a blood pressure cuff from the pharmacy aisle, pink, with a cartoon heart on the display.

"If the body is the variable," she said — she'd been thinking along the same lines I had, independently — "then we need to measure it. Heart rate, blood pressure. Data."

"That's what I've been —"

"I know. I saw your notebook through the window. You're measuring the wrong things. You're tracking their positions. You should be tracking ours."

She was right. And the fact that she was right, and had arrived at it faster than me from less information, produced in me a feeling I recognized from game theory: the specific discomfort of discovering that your model of the board is incomplete. In the prisoner's dilemma, the first move is to cooperate. Sienna was my first cooperator. The smart play was obvious. The smart play was also terrifying because cooperation meant proximity and proximity meant she would see me clearly and seeing me clearly was a threat that had nothing to do with the Turned.

"Your hand," she said.

"It's fine."

"It's not fine. It's infected. You need —"

"I know what I need. I read the textbook."

"Then you know you need antibiotics, not a sock."

She wasn't wrong about this either and I hated it.

---

We argued. About everything. She wanted to leave — find help, the National Guard, anyone with a plan. I wanted to stay and understand.

"We can't just sit here," she said. "The food runs out, the power's failing, and there's eleven of them out there and the number is going up."

"We leave and we die faster. You saw what happened to —"

"I saw. I also saw Jim walking around like it's Sunday morning. Whatever keeps him safe, we need to figure it out, and we're not going to figure it out in your kitchen."

"I am figuring it out. The textbook —"

"You've been *hiding.* There's a difference."

That landed. It landed because the line between observing and hiding is the same line between caution and cowardice and I'd been on the wrong side of it for four days and calling it strategy.

But the landing didn't stick. I had a reflex for this — a well-practiced move that deflected the blow before it could bruise. I did it without thinking: *I'm a hundred and eighty pounds. I can't run. I'm fifteen. What am I supposed to do — waddle out there and reason with them?* The self-deprecation was instant and complete and it felt like honesty, because it *was* honest — I really was fat, I really couldn't run, I really was fifteen — and the fact that it was honest made it invisible as a defense. You can't argue with someone's accurate self-assessment. You can only watch them use it as a reason to stay still.

She saw it on my face and didn't apologize. I respected that even as I wanted to crawl under the sink.

"I want to go back to the highway interchange," she said. "The military blockade. There were vehicles, equipment —"

"There were forty dead soldiers."

"There were forty *Turned* soldiers. And the vehicles they came in. Radios. Weapons. Medical supplies. We need those things."

"The interchange is a concentration point. You said it yourself — the highways funnel —"

"I said the perimeter collapsed. I didn't say the equipment disappeared."

This was Sienna's blind spot, and I would see it again: she defaulted to action the way I defaulted to analysis. Her instinct when trapped was to move, and moving was the thing most likely to kill her. She knew this — she'd watched it kill soldiers. But knowing and overriding are different operations, and her body was built for the 400-meter sprint, not for sitting in a kitchen with a fat kid arguing about risk assessment while the world ended outside.

"Not yet," I said. "Not until we know more."

"You always want to know more. At some point you have to *do* something with what you know."

"And if what I know is that doing something will get you killed?"

She went quiet. Her jaw tightened. I watched her process this — the runner's frustration at being told not to run — and for a moment I thought she'd leave, just walk out the back door and go to the interchange herself, because that was the kind of person she was, the kind who'd rather be wrong and in motion than right and still.

She didn't leave.

"Tell me what you know," she said.

---

She told me about the soldiers. I wanted to hear this. Part of me — the part still clinging to the movie — needed to hear that the military was out there, that the blockade was holding, that the system was functioning somewhere even if it hadn't reached us yet. The National Guard at the interchange was proof that somebody with authority and firepower was handling this. That was the last thread of the old framework: the cavalry exists, even if the cavalry is late.

"Six Humvees, two trucks. They set up at the interchange. Floodlights, barriers. Maybe forty soldiers."

Her hands were on the counter. I noticed they were shaking. This wasn't analysis anymore. This was memory costing her something.

"They engaged. Short bursts, disciplined. The Turned kept coming — you can hit one and it flinches and keeps walking. But the shooting was turning the soldiers. One dropped his weapon and stood there. Then another. Then three more. The combat was spiking their stress past whatever the line is, and the more they fought, the faster they crossed it. Twenty minutes. Forty soldiers. Gone."

She paused. Looked at the counter.

"The last one — a sergeant — he stopped shooting. Just stood there. Watched them walk toward him. And they walked right past him. He'd stopped fighting and they lost interest."

I sat with this. The last thread snapped. Forty soldiers with training and weapons and discipline, and the weapons were worse than useless — the combat itself was the thing that turned them. The cavalry wasn't late. The cavalry was already gone. Every assumption I'd been holding onto from the old world — that someone with more resources and more authority was working this problem, that the system would eventually reach down to a kid in a trailer park and pull him out — all of it was gone. Nobody was coming. The people most equipped to fight were the most vulnerable, because fighting was the trigger.

"That sergeant figured it out," I said. "Under fire, in real time, he figured out that fighting was the problem. That takes —" I didn't have a word for what that took. It wasn't courage. It was something harder than courage — the willingness to abandon every instinct you have in the moment when those instincts are loudest.

Sienna was quiet for a while. Then she said something that had nothing to do with soldiers.

"I can't sit still. You know that. I'm a runner. My whole life is about moving, about doing, about — and now the thing that kills people is the thing my body is built for. The activation, the adrenaline, the physical intensity. My strengths are all liabilities. Everything I'm good at is trying to kill me."

She said this without self-pity. She said it the way you'd describe a broken tool — factually, with irritation. But underneath the irritation was something I recognized because I'd felt it from the opposite direction: the vertigo of discovering that the person you've been is the wrong person for the world you're in.

"I know," I said. "My thing is the opposite. I've been sitting still my whole life. Never thought it would be the useful version of me."

"It's not," she said. "Sitting still keeps you alive. It doesn't keep anyone else alive. You need to move eventually. You just need to figure out how to move without dying."

This was the beginning of us. Not in the way I wanted it to be — not in the way that the useless ancient part of my brain kept suggesting — but in the way that actually mattered: two people with opposite broken pieces figuring out that the breaks fit together.

I handed her the blood pressure cuff.

"Test yourself," I said.

She strapped it on. Heart rate: 82. Blood pressure: 126/80. Higher than mine. The athlete's resting rate should have been lower than the couch potato's, but stress heart rate and resting heart rate are different systems, and Sienna was carrying a weight I wasn't: Jaylen, her parents, the fury of a body caged.

"We need to get that down," I said.

"Don't tell me to calm down."

"I wasn't going to. I was going to say that Jim walks outside every day and nothing happens to him and he's seventy years old with a bad heart, which means he's on medication that does chemically what you're trying to do through willpower. If we can figure out what he's taking —"

She looked at me. The expression was complicated — frustration, respect, the look people get when they realize the quiet kid in Lot 7 has been paying attention to things they missed.

"So we need to talk to Jim," she said.

"We need to talk to Jim."

Outside, the sun was going down. The Turned shifted their positions in that slow collective turn — tracking the sunset the way sunflowers track the horizon. Lisa Anderson was among them, face smooth and tilted toward the orange light.

---

We stayed up long into the night. I'm not going to narrate the whole conversation because some things are worth more as memories than as transcripts, but I want you to know it happened.

I talked about my mom. Not the analytical version — not the ER nurse on night shift during the outbreak, not the probability calculation I'd been running in my head since Saturday morning. The other version. The one where she lines up Saltines next to a Sprite before she leaves. The one where she stumbles over her own last name on a voicemail and I never mention it. I told Sienna about the fears I'd been carrying — that the world was going to stay like this, that the systems weren't coming back, that every strategy I could think of ended in a timeline I couldn't survive alone. I told her this because that is what a strategist does when the map runs out: he names the dark squares so they stop being infinite.

She talked about Jaylen. The dinosaur quizzes. How he'd correct her with this gravity that only seven-year-olds can pull off, like the relative size of a Giganotosaurus was the most important fact in the universe. She talked about her parents and the drive to Oklahoma City and how she'd told her mom to text when they got there and her mom hadn't texted. She talked about running — how the 400-meter was her event because it was the perfect distance, long enough to require strategy but short enough to require fury, and how everything she'd built her life around was now the thing most likely to kill her. She said this without self-pity, the same way she said everything, but her hands were wrapped around her mug and they were tight.

We drank Nesquik mixed with canned evaporated milk, because that was what was left in the cabinet and neither of us wanted water. It was too sweet and slightly gritty and we both drank it slowly, not because it was good but because drinking it slowly meant the conversation lasted longer, and the conversation was the first interruption in the isolation either of us had felt in days, and we were not ready for it to end.

I am not going to tell you what time we finally stopped talking. I am going to tell you that when we did, the trailer was less empty than it had been since Friday, and that is a fact worth recording even if I can't measure it.

She took the couch. I took the bathroom floor — my spot now, the place where the walls were closest and the dark felt managed. I lay there listening to the trailer settle and to the new sound layered over it: another person breathing.

Sometime after midnight I heard her twitch. A small sound — not a word, not a scream. A catch in her breath, then a sharp exhale, then the rustle of her shifting position. Then again, a few minutes later. A murmur that might have been "Jay" — the first syllable of a name she'd said seventeen times that evening. Her legs moved against the cushions, the runner's body running somewhere in the dark behind her eyes.

I lay on the bathroom floor and listened and didn't go to her and didn't call out. In the morning she said nothing about it. I didn't ask. We were both carrying things that came out only when consciousness stepped aside, and the unspoken agreement — already, on the first night — was that we would not name each other's ghosts.

Tomorrow we would cross Highway 21.
