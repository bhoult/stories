# Chapter 29: The Broadcast

The radio room was on the third floor of the science building — a converted communications lab with a transmitter that Moss's engineering grad student had boosted to broadcast over fifty miles. Far enough to reach the river valley. Far enough to reach anyone still listening in the towns and homesteads and hiding places scattered across the Ozarks.

The microphone was a desktop model, silver, old. The kind they used for campus radio before the campus radio stopped. It sat on the desk in front of me like a small, attentive animal, waiting.

Moss was in the doorway. "The transmitter is live. You'll be on the frequency I've been using for the scientific bulletins. Anyone with a CB or shortwave will hear you."

"How many people is that?"

"I don't know. I've had contact with eleven survivor groups in the past three weeks. There could be more who listen and don't respond." She paused. "Say what you need to say. Don't worry about being right. Worry about being useful."

She left. The door closed. I was alone with the microphone and the notebook and the low hum of the emitter vibrating through the floor.

I opened the notebook. The pages were wrinkled and stained and the handwriting was mine — the handwriting of a person who'd started in a trailer and was finishing in a laboratory. Not the same person at both ends. I turned to the fresh page where I'd written what I wanted to say. I'd revised it four times. The fourth version was still wrong. That was the point.

I pressed the transmit button.

"This is Nate Carver. I'm fifteen years old. I'm broadcasting from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. I don't know what I'm doing. I want to start with that."

I told them. All of it. The rules — the mechanism, the threshold, the beta-blockers, the voices, the density, the frenzy. The things I'd learned by watching people die because they didn't have the information. I told them about fortification and why it kills you. I told them about the Turned getting smarter. I told them that the damage they carried — the addiction, the depression, the grief — was their skillset now, that managing a craving was the same mechanism as managing fear. I told them to write it down.

I read from the notebook. The entries I'd written in a trailer, in a church, on a trail, in a pulloff on a highway covered in blood. The wrong parts and the right parts and the parts I still couldn't classify. The journal was the survival tool — an honest record of the past, failures included, and the only map any of us had.

I told them the hardest thing last.

"I'm not going to tell you to come to Fayetteville. We have an emitter here that keeps the Turned back, but it won't last. The organism adapts. The range is already shrinking. What we have here isn't a fortress — it's a lab. A place where people are learning. And the learning is the thing that matters, not the walls or the frequency.

"So I'm going to keep broadcasting. Dr. Moss has data — medication protocols, frequency specifications, everything she's learned. I have the human part — the mistakes, the lessons that don't fit in a lab report. Between us, we'll give you what we can. What you do with it is yours.

"Stay calm. Stay small. Stay quiet. Write it down.

"This is Nate Carver. I'm fifteen. I survived. Not because I was brave. Because I was slow, and scared, and I paid attention.

"I'll be here tomorrow. Same frequency. Same time.

"Stay alive."

I released the transmit button. The microphone sat on the desk, silver and quiet. The hum of the emitter filled the room.

I sat there for a while. My hands were shaking — not fear this time. The kind that comes after you've done something irreversible and the adrenaline is turning into something between relief and terror.

Through the window, the campus was quiet in the early evening light. The track, empty — Sienna had finished her laps. Caleb's drawings taped to a bulletin board on the quad. Marcus's wrench audible even from the third floor.

The CB on the desk crackled. Static. Then a voice — distant, broken, a man's voice from somewhere south, maybe thirty miles out, maybe more:

"— heard you. We heard you. There are twelve of us. We have a pharmacy. We didn't know about the beta-blockers. We're —"

Static swallowed the rest. But the voice had been there. Someone had heard.

I picked up the microphone.

"This is Nate Carver. I hear you. Tell me your location. Tell me what you need. I'm listening."
