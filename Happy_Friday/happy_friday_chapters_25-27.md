# Chapter 25: The Herd

From the last rise on Highway 71, where the road crested a hill and the landscape opened into the broad plateau south of Fayetteville, I looked through the binoculars and stopped counting at two hundred.

The outskirts of the city spread below us — a mile of open terrain, fields and subdivisions and strip malls and the wide, flat infrastructure of a college town's southern approach. Gas stations. A Dollar General. A church with a full parking lot — the cars still there, the congregation not. And beyond all of it, barely visible through the November haze, the campus. Red brick. Limestone. The glass front of the science building catching the late-afternoon sun.

Between us and the campus: Turned. Hundreds of them. Standing in the fields and parking lots and roads like cattle at a watering hole — swaying faintly, oriented toward nothing and everything, their spacing uniform, their density breathtaking. They filled the approach from the tree line on the west to the first suburban streets on the east. The city drew them the way cities had drawn people for ten thousand years — the infrastructure, the flat ground, the gravitational pull of human settlement that was hardwired into the biology the organism had inherited.

I lowered the binoculars. My hands were not shaking. This felt like an achievement that should have been comforting and was not.

"How many?" Sienna asked. She was beside me on the hilltop, the whole group arrayed along the shoulder of the highway, looking down at the approach the way you'd look down at the surface of another planet.

"I stopped counting at two hundred. There are more."

"How many more?"

"I don't know. Five hundred. A thousand. The density isn't uniform — they're thicker near the buildings, thinner in the open fields. But the approach is a mile wide and they're distributed across the whole thing."

Silence. Below us, the Turned swayed.

Marcus said: "The university is down there. Straight through. Maybe two miles."

"Through them."

"Through them."

Ruth, leaning on her walking stick: "Is there another way in?"

"We could loop east, try to come in from the other side. But the Turned ring the city — they're drawn to the population center. Every approach looks like this." Marcus paused. "Looping adds a day. Maybe two."

"Ruth's atenolol runs out tomorrow," Maria said. No inflection. Just math.

I looked at the valley again. The binoculars brought the Turned into close focus — faces, bodies, the details. Some were recent — clothing intact, skin undamaged, the look of people who'd been walking for weeks but were otherwise maintained by the organism. Others were older, deteriorating — the ones from the early days, five or six weeks out, their bodies showing the wear that the organism couldn't fully prevent: sunburned skin, untreated injuries, the gauntness of inadequate nutrition. Pembrook's green had been the early sign. Down here, in the full sun of the valley floor, many of them had the same discoloration — faces and forearms tinged with that vegetal shade, the photosynthetic adaptation progressing, the organism slowly converting its hosts into something that fed on light as well as food.

And the clothing. I'd been tracking it since Week One — Pembrook's open robe, the garden woman's discarded shoes, the interchange soldiers stripping body armor — and here, in a herd of hundreds, the pattern was undeniable. A visible timeline of conversion expressed in degrees of undress. The newest Turned were fully clothed, recent enough that the organism hadn't prioritized the removal. Ones from Week Two had lost shoes, jackets, hats — the outer layers gone, folded or piled nearby. The older ones, the Week One conversions, were nearly nude — shirts gone, pants gone, standing in the valley sun in nothing but the greening skin, their bodies turned toward the light like panels on a solar array. The progression was clear: the longer someone had been Turned, the less they wore. And the undressing was deliberate — not decay, not tearing, but removal. Folding. Placement. As if the organism needed the skin exposed and was systematically eliminating anything that blocked whatever the skin was doing.

The swarm threshold. I did the math instantly, and the math made my vision narrow. The threshold was density-dependent, not count-dependent. Thirty in a parking lot had been enough. These were hundreds in an open valley — the density was lower than a parking lot, spread across a mile of floodplain. Were they above threshold? Below? At threshold, the behavior had been frenzy — undirected destruction, the organism's coordination collapsing into violence. But what I was seeing below was not frenzy. It was the opposite. It was a vast, eerie stillness — a coherence that went beyond the smaller groups I'd observed. As if at this scale, the organism achieved something else entirely. Not the chaotic breakdown of the swarm. A superintelligence. A collective mind, aware, patient, watching.

"We walk through," I said.

The silence that followed was the loudest silence of the trip.

---

We left the shopping carts at the top of the hill. Packs on our backs again — lighter now after the fortified group's trade, but still heavy enough that the straps bit into shoulders that had softened during the days of pushing carts on pavement. We descended in the late morning. Single file. Breathing.

The order of march was deliberate: Jim first, because Jim was the calmest person alive and his metoprolol and his faith and his thirty years of pastoral composure made him the tip of the spear — not an attacking spear, a parting one, the way the bow of a boat parts water. Then Marcus, carrying Caleb on his back, because Marcus's depression was his dominant strategy and Caleb needed to be with the person least likely to spike. Then Dale, because Dale's recovery skills were running hot and his hands were steady and his whole body had been trained for exactly this kind of endurance. Then Maria, because Maria's organizational calm was its own kind of armor. Then Ruth, walking stick in hand, pace slow, each step considered. Then Sienna. Then me.

I was last because I was the watcher. Because someone needed to see the whole picture, and seeing the whole picture was my function, and my function required distance.

The hill dropped us off the highway and onto the flat approach. The ground changed — from cracked asphalt to the weedy edges of a subdivision road, past mailboxes and driveways and a school bus stopped permanently at a corner. The campus was two miles ahead, barely visible through the haze of a thousand standing bodies. Between us and the university, the Turned.

They noticed us.

Not the way the smaller groups noticed — the head-turn, the tracking, the individual evaluation. This was collective. A ripple. A thousand faces turning in unison, slowly, the way sunflowers track the sun, and the sunflower comparison was no longer a metaphor but a description. They turned toward us as a field turns toward light — every face, every body, orienting in a single smooth motion that crossed the valley floor like a wave. The sound of it — a thousand bodies shifting weight on sandy soil — was a low, continuous whisper, like wind through grass except there was no wind.

Jim kept walking. He hummed — the tuneless melody he hummed at the church, the one that had no name and no key and was just the sound Jim made when he was being Jim. The humming was steady, low, anchoring. He walked into the edge of the herd the way you'd walk into water — one step at a time, accepting the depth.

The Turned parted. Not dramatically — not like the Red Sea. They shifted. An inch here, a step there, creating a passage that was less a path than an absence, a gap that moved with Jim, always just wide enough, always closing behind him. The faces tracked him. Blank, smooth, the organism's default expression. Mouths slightly open. Eyes that followed without seeing, or that saw something we couldn't.

We followed. Single file. The spacing was critical — too close and we were a mass, a provocation, a collective signal. Too far and the passage Jim opened would close before the last person passed. Three yards between each person. Measured. Breathing.

The first hundred yards were the worst because the first hundred yards were where the model met reality and the model didn't cover this. I had observed Turned from steeples and treelines. I had walked past small groups. I had hidden from concentrations and collapsed structures onto swarms. But I had never been inside one — surrounded on all sides, the closest Turned less than six feet away, their bodies filling my peripheral vision, their smell everywhere, a collective scent that was not the smell of unwashed bodies but something else, something organic and alien, the smell of the organism itself breathing through a thousand hosts.

Faces passed. Some I almost recognized — not individuals I knew but types, the ghost of a grandmother, the echo of a teacher. This was the uncanny valley made literal: human faces with nothing human behind them, the topology of personality without the content, like masks in a shop window.

Then the voices started.

Not the targeted mimicry — not the precise, weaponized use of a specific person's voice to crack a specific target's composure. This was ambient. Fragments. Half-words and broken syllables drifting through the herd like radio static — a woman's voice saying something that might have been a name, a man's voice with the cadence of a question, a child's voice that was just sound, just the tone and rhythm of a child speaking without any of the words.

The fragments didn't resolve. They hovered at the edge of meaning — close enough to activate the pattern-recognition circuits, too far to complete. This was worse than the targeted mimicry. The targeted version was a key in a lock — specific, defeatable, because you could identify the wrong detail, the Taco Bell that should have been Whataburger. The ambient version was fog. It was every voice you'd ever known, broken into pieces and reassembled wrong, and your brain kept trying to make them cohere and they kept almost cohering and the effort of processing the almost was its own kind of assault.

Sienna, ahead of me, faltered. A half-step. A catch in her stride. I saw her shoulders tighten and her head tilt toward a fragment — something that sounded like her father's voice, something that might have been her name — and then she corrected. Breathed. Walked.

My own brain was doing the same thing. Somewhere in the fog of voices I heard — thought I heard — the word "bud" in a voice that was close to my mother's, and the word went through me like an electric current and I breathed and counted — four in, hold, six out — and the current dissipated and I kept walking and I didn't stop and I didn't scream and the not-screaming was a form of prayer.

---

We reached the center of the herd after ninety minutes. The density was highest here — the Turned packed closer, the gaps narrower, the passage that Jim opened shrinking to shoulders-width. I could have reached out and touched the nearest Turned. I did not reach out. I kept my arms at my sides and my eyes forward and my breathing measured and I walked through the center of a thousand stolen lives and didn't touch any of them.

A cluster of Turned near the center began droning. The summoning call — that low, resonant vibration that preceded the convergence behavior. I felt it in my sternum. More Turned began drifting inward, tightening the density around us. The gap narrowed. The pressure increased. I could feel the threshold approaching — not as data but as a physical sensation, a compression, the air getting heavier, the organism's collective attention focusing on the small anomalies moving through its body.

I did the only thing I could think of.

I started talking.

"Okay," I said. Quietly. Conversationally. As if I were sitting in Lot 7 with a controller in my hands and a screen in front of me and a bag of chips on the armrest and the world was still the world. "So the thing about *Civilization VI* is that the AI is broken. It's always been broken. Gilgamesh is the best early-game civ because you get the War-Cart, which is a heavy chariot replacement that gets bonus combat strength against anti-cavalry, and the AI never builds enough anti-cavalry to counter it. You rush four War-Carts by turn thirty and you can take a city-state before the AI has archers on the walls."

The Turned near me tilted their heads. The drilling was the signal of a human voice — not the fear-soaked, adrenaline-laden signal they fed on, but something else. A voice producing words without panic. A voice in the register of normal. Conversational. Boring.

"The real trick is the Zigzag of Ur. You get it from being suzerain of a city-state, and it gives you plus three science in the ancient era, which doesn't sound like much but in the early game it's the difference between getting Bronze Working on turn fifteen versus turn twenty, and Bronze Working lets you build Spearmen, which are the anti-cavalry unit, which is ironic because you're playing as the civ with the best anti-anti-cavalry unit, so you're building the counter to your own counter, which is —"

I was babbling. I knew I was babbling. The babbling was the point. The sound of a human voice talking about nothing — about video game strategy, about unit counters and tech trees and the optimal build order for a fictional Sumerian civilization — was the most boring, least threatening, most aggressively ordinary sound I could produce. It was the opposite of a scream. It was the opposite of fear. It was a fifteen-year-old boy talking about his favorite game while walking through a thousand aliens wearing human skin, and the absurdity of it was the thing that kept my heart rate at 78 because the part of my brain that produced anxiety and the part that produced embarrassment couldn't operate simultaneously, and the embarrassment of narrating *Civilization VI* strategy to a valley of Turned was winning.

Dale, ahead of me, made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been a sob and was probably both.

The droning subsided. The density around us loosened — fractionally, enough. The Turned's heads tilted at my voice and then tilted away, processing, filing, the collective intelligence deciding that the sound was not a threat signal and redirecting its attention elsewhere.

We walked. I talked. I talked about Gilgamesh and about Alexander and about the wonder system and about why the Pyramids were a trap in multiplayer and about how the optimal science victory required you to ignore military entirely until the modern era, which was a strategy that worked in the game and absolutely did not work in real life, as demonstrated by our current situation.

Sienna, ahead of me, glanced back once. Her expression was — I can't describe her expression. It contained horror and love and the specific look of a person watching someone do something so bizarre and so necessary that the only possible response is to witness it.

---

We reached the edge of the frequency zone at the three-hour mark.

I felt it before I heard it — a pressure in the sinuses, a tightness behind the eyes, the feeling before a thunderstorm when the air gets heavy and your ears don't quite pop. And the Turned felt it too. Their density thinned here, the spacing widening, the bodies leaning slightly away from whatever was ahead the way you lean away from a sound that hurts. Some swayed erratically. One, standing near a fire hydrant, had his hands at his temples, his face contorted in something that looked like discomfort.

The campus was visible now — a quarter mile ahead, red brick through the haze, the glass front of the science building catching light. On the roof, an array of speakers and antenna components. The source.

Ruth couldn't make it. The last hundred yards — the final stretch through the thinning Turned to the edge of the campus — were more than her heart could take. Not panic. Not the threshold. Just a seventy-two-year-old woman who had walked three hours through a nightmare on bad knees with no medication left and whose body was saying *enough.*

She stopped. Her legs buckled. Jim caught her — one arm around her waist, steady, the practiced catch of a man who'd been supporting people his whole life.

"Ruth," he said. "I've got you."

"My knees do not require narration," she said. But her voice was thin and her face was grey and she was leaning on him in a way that was not correcting his grammar.

Jim talked to her. Not about survival. Not about the Turned. About birds. "Did you know the painted bunting is native to Arkansas? Leonard would have known. Leonard knew every bird in the county." He lifted her — not carried, supported — and they walked the last hundred yards together, step by step, Ruth's walking stick finding the sidewalk, her weight against his shoulder.

"Leonard did know every bird," Ruth said. "He also knew every pipe fitting manufactured after 1974. The man was an encyclopedia of useless information."

"Useful information," Jim said. "You fixed the cistern."

"I fixed the cistern with his knowledge and my hands. The collaboration persists."

They reached the campus perimeter. Marcus was already there, Caleb on his back, the boy's face buried in Marcus's shoulder where it had been for three hours. Dale and Maria. Sienna. Me.

I stepped onto the campus sidewalk and my legs buckled and I went to my knees and I stayed there for a moment with my hands on the concrete and I breathed. Behind me, the herd was a dark ring — a thousand faces still oriented toward us from beyond the frequency's edge, watching, the collective intelligence observing our arrival with the same vast patience with which it had observed our passage.

The Turned didn't follow. They stood at the perimeter, swaying, pressing against the invisible wall of sound, unable or unwilling to cross. The frequency hummed in my teeth and my sinuses and the headache was immediate and persistent and it was the most beautiful headache I'd ever had because it meant we were inside and they were outside and the line between held.

That night, in a dormitory common room on campus with the frequency humming in the walls, Marcus pointed at the sky through the window. Orion was up. The Pleiades. Caleb was asleep — finally asleep, after three hours of stillness on Marcus's back that had been its own kind of heroism for a seven-year-old.

Nobody slept for a while. We sat in the common room and we shook — all of us, the collective shaking of eight people whose bodies had held steady for three hours and were now releasing the accumulated charge. It was almost funny, the whole group vibrating like an engine cooling down, and at some point Maria said "We look like a support group for people who've seen a ghost" and Ruth said "We look like a support group for people who've walked through a ghost" and Maria laughed and the laugh was too loud and too long and had tears in it and Ruth put her hand on Maria's shoulder and Maria put her hand on Ruth's hand and neither of them said anything else.

Marcus made coffee. Found in a kitchenette down the hall — actual coffee, ground, in a can someone had left. Brewed in a pot on the electric burner that still worked because the campus had solar. Served in actual mugs with actual handles. For Caleb — who woke up long enough to drink and fall back asleep — in a mug that said RAZORBACKS and had a cartoon boar on the side. Marcus stared at the coffee maker for a full minute before saying, "I haven't used one of these in six weeks," and Dale said, "Welcome back to civilization," and Marcus said, "Civilization has a headache," meaning the frequency, and the exchange was nothing and it was the funniest thing any of us had heard in a week.

Sienna sat close to me. Not the shoulder-lean from the first campfire — closer, her side pressed against mine, deliberate. Neither of us spoke about it. We'd walked through a thousand Turned that day and the relationship between the two of us had changed during the walking, not because anything dramatic happened but because you can't match breathing with someone for three hours in a field of stolen faces without something shifting at the foundation level. The shift had no name and didn't need one.

Jim prayed. It was the shortest prayer he'd ever said: "Thank you." Two words. The fluorescent lights hummed. The frequency hummed. The building held us like a palm.

I wrote under the lights — actual electric lights, the first I'd written under since the trailer. The notebook was nearly full. I'd need a new one soon. The university had notebooks. The university was real. We were inside it.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #19:**

*We walked through. A thousand Turned. Three hours. Nobody panicked. Nobody ran. Nobody died.*

*Jim led with a hymn. Marcus carried Caleb and talked about truck stops. Dale walked steady. Maria counted steps. Ruth walked until she couldn't and then Jim carried her and talked about birds. Sienna breathed.*

*I talked about Civilization VI.*

*I talked about a video game while walking through a thousand organisms wearing human faces and the absurdity of it is the thing that saved us because absurdity and terror can't coexist in the same nervous system and my brain chose absurdity and the organism didn't know what to do with a signal that was neither fear nor calm but something else entirely — something so ordinary and so stupid that it didn't fit any of its models.*

*Maybe that's the lesson. Maybe the organism can process our fear and our calm and our courage and our despair. Maybe it can read every signal the human nervous system produces. But maybe it can't read the signal that says "this person is explaining the tech tree for Sumerian civilization in a strategy game while surrounded by a thousand of you and his heart rate is 78 because he's too embarrassed to be afraid." Maybe the thing that saves us is the thing that's uniquely, irreducibly, absurdly human.*

*Or maybe I got lucky. The data set is insufficient. I survived and that's the only data point and one data point is not a pattern.*

*We're on campus. We're inside the frequency. Ruth is getting medication tonight. The math, for once, worked out.*

*We made it.*

---

That night, everyone dreamed.

I know because I woke at 2 AM to a dormitory full of sounds — small sounds, the night-language of eight people whose bodies had held steady for three hours and whose minds, released from the discipline of waking, were processing what the discipline had suppressed. Marcus was muttering — not words, just the cadence of words, the rhythm of a conversation with someone who wasn't there. Sienna's legs were moving under her blanket, running, the stride pattern I knew from watching her on the trail. Ruth made a sound I'd never heard her make — a thin, keening note, barely audible, the sound of a woman who corrected grammar by day and wept for her husband by night. Dale's hands were moving on empty air, carving, the muscle memory so deep it ran in his sleep.

I lay on a dormitory mattress — a real mattress, impossibly soft after weeks of sleeping pads and bare ground — with my hand on my pulse. Seventy-four. Safe. But the dreams had been there, waiting behind my eyelids, and the herd was in every one. A thousand faces turning. The ambient voices. The word *bud* in the fog. In one fragment I'd been walking through them but they were walking too, all of us going the same direction, single file along a street, and I couldn't tell which ones were us and which ones were them and the not-knowing was the worst part.

In the morning, nobody talked about it directly. But the signs were there — the heaviness, the slow starts, the way people stared at their coffee like it owed them something. Maria said, "I couldn't get warm all night," and Dale said, "Me neither," and the building had been heated and they weren't talking about cold.

Jim found me while I was refilling the water bottles from the creek. He looked rested — Jim always looked rested, the metoprolol and the faith combining into a composure that seemed to extend into sleep. But his eyes had something in them. Not fatigue. Attention.

"I had a dream," he said. Casual. The way he said everything — conversational, unforced, as if the content of the sentence were incidental to the act of saying it.

I waited.

"I was sitting on a roof. A big building — flat roof, institutional. Below me was a campus. Buildings, quadrangles, oak trees. And there was a sound. A sound like a bell that never stopped ringing — not loud, just constant, in the bones, everywhere." He paused. Picked up a pebble from the creek bank and turned it in his fingers. "A boy was sitting next to me. Young. Writing in a notebook. Writing fast, like he was afraid he'd forget."

"What was he writing?"

Jim looked at me. The look was steady and contained something I couldn't name — not surprise, not certainty, something between. The look of a man who had learned to hold what he received without demanding that it make sense.

"Everything," he said. "He was writing everything."

He dropped the pebble in the creek and walked back to camp. I stood there with the water bottles and the creek running cold over the stones and the hair on my arms standing up because Jim had just described a roof I'd never seen and a campus I'd never visited and a sound I'd never heard and a boy writing in a notebook who was, unmistakably, me.

I wrote it down. I underlined it. I wrote no interpretation because I had none.

# Chapter 26: The Frequency

The door of the life sciences building opened before we reached it.

A woman stood in the entrance — young, maybe thirty, short black hair, glasses, wearing a lab coat over a flannel shirt and jeans. She was thin in the way of someone who'd been too focused to eat properly for weeks. Her eyes were sharp and tired and she had a permanent squint — the squint of a person who had been living inside the frequency for a month and whose face had rearranged itself around the discomfort.

"You're the church group," she said. "From Clarksville. I've been listening for you on the CB."

"Dr. Moss?" Jim said.

"Eleanor. Come in. The sound is better inside — the building attenuates it by about thirty percent. It never goes away entirely. You get used to it." She paused. "That's a lie. You don't get used to it. You just stop complaining about it."

We went inside.

The life sciences building was a functioning laboratory in a failing world. Emergency lighting, powered by the solar grid. Equipment humming — centrifuges, spectral analyzers, things I couldn't name. Three graduate students were working at stations — a woman labeling slides, a man at a computer terminal running on generator power, another man monitoring a bank of screens showing camera feeds of the campus perimeter. And a janitor — a heavy-set man in his sixties, mopping the floor of the lobby with the methodical attention of a person who had decided that cleanliness was his contribution to the survival of the species.

"Howard," Dr. Moss said, by way of introduction. "He runs the facility. I just do the science."

"Someone's got to keep the lights on," Howard said, not looking up from his mopping.

---

Moss gave us the science that night.

We sat in a seminar room — the kind with tiered seating and a whiteboard and a projector that no longer worked. Moss stood at the whiteboard with a dry-erase marker and drew diagrams that I photographed with my eyes because my notebook was almost full and I was rationing pages.

"The organism is triggered by sustained elevation of catecholamines — epinephrine, norepinephrine — above a threshold of approximately three hundred picograms per milliliter for a sustained period of roughly two minutes," she said. "You've already figured out most of this. Your journal —" She looked at me. Marcus had radioed ahead. She'd been expecting us. "— your journal describes the mechanism with remarkable accuracy for someone working from a nursing textbook and direct observation."

"I was wrong about some things."

"You were wrong about a lot of things. You were also right about the things that mattered, and you documented the process of being wrong, which is more valuable than being right." She turned to the whiteboard. "Here's what you don't know."

She drew a cell. Not a human cell — something else, with structures I didn't recognize.

"The organism's protein structures do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny. Not bacterial, not archaeal, not viral, not fungal. The biochemistry is adjacent to Earth's — close enough to interact with human biology, to hijack the endocrine system, to use our cellular machinery for its own replication. But the base structures are foreign. The chirality of several key amino acid analogs is reversed. The membrane chemistry uses lipid structures that don't exist in any Earth ecosystem."

She let this sit.

"It's not from here," she said. Simply. No drama. The way you'd report a lab result.

The room was quiet.

"Not engineered," she continued. "Not a weapon. Not a mutation. Not from a lab. The genome — if we can call it that — shows no signatures of intentional design. It shows the signatures of evolution. But evolution in an environment that is not this one."

Jim, from the back row: "Where?"

"I don't know. I have a hypothesis I'm not willing to broadcast because the hypothesis is speculative and I've watched enough misinformation kill people in the last six weeks to last several lifetimes." She put the marker down. "What I can tell you is this: the organism communicates. The Turned coordinate because the organism synchronizes their behavior through a biochemical signaling network that functions like a distributed nervous system. The frequency —" She gestured upward, toward the emitter on the roof. "— disrupts that synchronization. It's the biological equivalent of jamming a radio signal. I reverse-engineered it from the organism's own communication patterns."

She drew a new diagram — three columns, labeled.

"Behavioral states. You've identified two in your journal: herding and swarming. There's a third." She wrote it: *Hunting.* "Herding is the reproductive strategy — fear-farming, the conversion cycle, patient and coordinated. Swarming is the density-collapse behavior — the threshold event, uncontrolled destruction. Hunting is the caloric strategy — food-driven, directed, problem-solving. Small groups, coordinated by a distinct acoustic signal."

"The bark," I said. "Short, sharp."

She looked at me. "You've observed it."

"At the interchange. And at the church — a Turned killed a cat and made the sound and another Turned a block away oriented immediately."

"That signal is a dedicated hunting call. It activates other Turned within auditory range as hunters — directed, aggressive, food-motivated. Critically —" She underlined something on the board. "— the hunting state is also triggered by attack. If a Turned is struck, threatened, physically engaged, it switches to hunting mode and produces the call. The implications for armed defense are significant. Every shot fired at a Turned potentially activates every Turned within earshot as hunters. The military checkpoints failed in part because the gunfire was triggering mass hunting activation on top of the density-threshold swarm."

She paused.

"Hunting is metabolically driven. As caloric resources deplete — and they are depleting — hunting becomes the dominant behavior. The emitter disrupts herding and swarming coordination effectively. It's less effective against hunting because hunting is metabolically motivated, not communicatively motivated. A hungry Turned at the perimeter is testing the frequency edge not because the collective is directing it but because its individual caloric need is overriding the discomfort."

She drew another diagram — a cross-section of skin.

"The photosynthesis. You noted the green discoloration — the sun-facing behavior, the skin changes. The organism is introducing chlorophyll analogs into the host's dermis. The skin is becoming a solar panel. This supplements caloric intake as conventional food sources deplete." She tapped the board. "The clothing removal you've been tracking — shoes first, then shirts, then everything — is the organism systematically eliminating anything that blocks photon absorption. The host's skin needs maximum sun exposure for the photosynthetic system to function. The removal is deliberate, ordered, and accelerates as caloric need increases."

"The oldest ones in the herd were nearly nude," I said. "The newest were fully clothed."

"Because the older Turned have been photosynthesizing longer and the organism has had time to optimize. Given enough time, every Turned will be fully exposed. The organism doesn't need clothing and the clothing blocks a food source. Pure resource optimization."

"How long will it hold?" Marcus asked.

Moss hesitated. It was the first hesitation I'd seen from her — a crack in the scientific composure, brief, quickly sealed.

"When I first activated the emitter three weeks ago, the Turned fled to a mile's distance. They're now at four hundred yards. Last Tuesday, I observed one standing at the perimeter for six hours, swaying, as if acclimating." She looked at Marcus. "The organism is adapting. Slowly — biological adaptation, not strategic — but measurably. I give the emitter weeks. Maybe a couple of months. Eventually they'll push through."

"And then?"

"And then we need a better solution. Which is what I'm working on. Which is why I've been broadcasting — not just to share information, but to find people who can help. Researchers. Engineers. Anyone with expertise the three graduate students and I don't have." She looked at our group — a pastor, a trucker, a retired teacher, an office manager, a recovering addict, a track athlete, a seven-year-old, and a fifteen-year-old with a notebook. "I was hoping for a virologist. But I'll take what I can get."

"You've got a plumber," Ruth said. "By marriage."

Moss almost smiled. The almost-smile faded. She turned back to the whiteboard, where her diagrams of the organism's cell structure occupied the left half and her timeline of behavioral adaptation occupied the right.

"The organism adapts," she said. "That's the fundamental problem. Everything we build — the emitter, the beta-blockers, the behavioral techniques — works for a while and then the organism learns to work around it. We're in an arms race with something that iterates faster than we do. The emitter buys time. The medication buys time. The question is whether we can use that time to find something permanent."

I looked at the whiteboard. At the diagrams. At the timeline showing the emitter's declining effectiveness in a descending curve.

On the wall behind the whiteboard, partially obscured by a bookshelf, I noticed a printout. It showed orbital data — trajectories, dates, coordinates. At the top, a designation: Comet C/2026 Voss. Several dates were circled in red pen. A handwritten note in the margin, in Moss's small, precise handwriting: *incubation window?*

I looked at it. Moss saw me looking. She didn't explain.

---

That night, in a dormitory room on the second floor of the science building with the frequency humming in the walls and a headache that would become my permanent companion, I opened the notebook to the last empty page.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #20:**

*We made it.*

*Dr. Eleanor Moss. The University of Arkansas. A laboratory that's still running. A frequency that keeps the Turned at bay — for now. For weeks. Maybe months. A diminishing window that's shrinking as the organism adapts.*

*She says it's not from here. Not engineered. Not a weapon. Evolved — but not on this planet. She has data she won't speculate about publicly. I saw a printout about a comet on her wall. She saw me see it. She didn't say anything.*

*The emitter works. The medications work. Everything works for a while. The organism learns. The question is whether we can learn faster.*

*Ruth's atenolol is resupplied — Moss has cases of it, stored in a pharmacy basement on campus. Jim's metoprolol, same. Dale doesn't need Suboxone anymore. Marcus hasn't had a drink in three weeks. Caleb is drawing dinosaurs with crayons he found in a classroom. Sienna is looking at the campus track through the window and her feet are moving.*

*We're safe. For now. "For now" is all anyone has ever had. The difference is we know it.*

### *"I survived. I wish that felt like enough."*

On Day 42, I gave Dr. Moss my journal.

I hadn't planned to. The notebook was mine — private, wrinkled, stained with septic residue that no amount of airing could fully remove. It contained my mistakes in chronological order, each entry a monument to something I hadn't understood until it was too late, and the thought of a scientist reading my fifteen-year-old's approximations of biochemistry felt like handing a crayon drawing to a museum curator.

But Moss asked. She'd heard Marcus describe the journal on the CB. She wanted primary source data — eyewitness observations from the first six weeks, documented in real time, uncorrected by hindsight. "Everyone who comes in tells me what they remember," she said. "Memory is reconstruction. Memory edits. What I need is what someone wrote down while it was happening, including the parts they got wrong."

I handed it over. She sat in her office — a small room off the main lab, cluttered with printouts and specimen jars and a poster of the periodic table that someone had annotated with hand-drawn sad faces over the elements whose lab stocks were exhausted. The comet printout was on the wall behind her. I did not ask about it. She read.

She read for two hours. I sat in a chair across from her and watched her read and tried not to narrate my own anxiety, which was considerable, because the journal was the most honest thing I'd ever produced and honesty, once it leaves your hands, belongs to someone else's interpretation.

She turned pages. She made notes on a separate pad. Occasionally she looked up — not at me, at the wall, processing something, the way I processed things by staring at the ceiling of the trailer. Then back to the journal. Entry by entry. Mistake by mistake.

When she finished, she set the notebook on the desk and looked at me.

"Your biochemistry is wrong in several places," she said. "The HPA axis description in entry two is simplified to the point of inaccuracy. Your threshold numbers are inconsistent. You misidentify the parasympathetic response as 'vagal override' in entry five, which isn't a real term."

"I know. I was working from a nursing textbook and Wikipedia articles I'd read before the internet went down."

"I know you know. That's why the journal is valuable." She tapped the notebook. "This isn't a scientific document. It's a learning document. Every entry shows what you thought, what happened, and what you figured out next. The errors are the most important part — they show the process of revision. They show a mind encountering data that contradicts its model and updating the model instead of defending it."

She leaned back.

"I've had seventeen survivor groups reach this campus. Most of them have stories. Some have observations. A few have strategies. None of them documented the process the way you did. None of them wrote down what they got wrong."

"Most people don't enjoy writing down their failures."

"Most people don't survive long enough to benefit from them." She paused. "I want you to keep writing. Not for yourself — for other survivors. The broadcasts I've been making are scientific — mechanism, pharmacology, the emitter. What I can't broadcast is this." She tapped the journal again. "The human part. The part that tells people how to *live* with the knowledge. How to stay calm when the mechanism is telling your body to panic. How to make decisions when the decisions are terrible. How to be fifteen and responsible for seven people and scared every minute and still functional."

"I don't know how I did that."

"That's fine. You wrote down how you did it while you were doing it, which is better than knowing, because knowing is retrospective and retrospective is edited and edited is useless. The unedited version is what people need."

She picked up the journal and held it out.

"I want to compile a guide. A manual. How to stay human in a world that punishes humanity's best instincts. Your journal is the model — not because it's correct, but because it shows the process of becoming correct. The failures are the curriculum."

I took the journal back. It felt different in my hands — heavier, or maybe I was lighter. The same pages, the same entries, the same wrinkled, stained record of a month and a half of being wrong and revising and surviving. But the purpose had shifted. It wasn't just mine anymore. It was data. It was a survival guide written by accident by a kid who'd been trying to survive.

"There's a private entry," I said. "One I didn't show anyone. About the overpass. About —" I stopped. "About the thing I'm capable of."

"I know. Marcus mentioned it."

"Do you want to read it?"

She looked at me. The squint — the permanent squint from the frequency — made her expression hard to read, but her eyes were clear behind it.

"Do you want me to?"

I hesitated. The private entry was the thing I carried that was different from the other things I carried — not a failure, not a mistake, but a capacity. The capacity to look at human beings and calculate the load-bearing properties of the structure above them. The capacity to be the person who made that plan and executed it and stepped over the hand with the wedding ring and kept walking. The capacity that Jim wouldn't look at and Sienna looked at too much and that I was afraid of because it worked.

I handed her the notebook, open to the private entry.

She read it. Thirty seconds.

"You're afraid of this part of yourself," she said.

"Yes."

"You should be. It's the part that will keep people alive and it's the part that will cost you things you can't calculate yet. Both of those are true simultaneously and neither one cancels the other." She closed the notebook. "People need an enemy. They need someone to blame, someone to beat. If I told the public that this organism isn't a weapon, isn't engineered, isn't anyone's fault — that this is just contact, an accident, an ecology encountering another ecology — I don't think people can hear that right now. They need the story to have a villain."

"Does it have a villain?"

"It has an organism doing what organisms do. It found an ecological niche and it's exploiting it. The niche happens to be the human fear response. That's not evil. It's biology." She looked at the comet printout on the wall. Looked away. "The villain, if there is one, is the gap between what the world is and what people believe it is. Your whole journal is about that gap. Every death you recorded was someone dying inside the gap — Craig Lyle, the gas station group on Highway 71, the soldiers at the blockade. They died because their model of the world was wrong and they couldn't revise it fast enough."

"And the people who survived?"

"Revised. That's the only difference. The people who survive this won't be the strongest or the bravest. They'll be the ones who write down what they got wrong."

That evening, in the seminar room, I opened the journal to the entry about the fortified group on Highway 71 — the nine survivors in the gas station, the barbed wire between the pumps, the woman with the shotgun who wouldn't leave. I reread it. Then I turned to a fresh page — the last fresh page — and wrote:

**JOURNAL ENTRY #21:**

*Dr. Moss wants me to compile a guide. A manual for surviving a world that punishes courage and rewards caution and eats the people who can't tell the difference. She says my journal is the model — not the conclusions but the process. Not what I got right but how I figured out what I got wrong.*

*I don't know how to write a survival guide. I know how to write what happened and what I learned and where the learning cost someone something they can't get back. I know how to document the gap between the model and the world. I know how to be wrong on paper.*

*Maybe that's enough. Maybe a survival guide for the end of the world is just a record of someone being wrong, over and over, and not dying of it.*

*Tomorrow I'm going to try something. Moss has a broadcast transmitter — more powerful than the CB, campus radio equipment, range of fifty miles or more. She's been using it for scientific bulletins. She's going to let me use it for something else.*

*I'm going to talk. Into a microphone. To whoever is out there. I'm going to tell them what I know, which is not much, and what I've learned, which is everything, and I'm going to start with the thing nobody wants to hear: the thing that's killing you isn't the monsters. It's the fear. And the fear is manageable. Not comfortable. Not easy. Manageable.*

*I'm scared of the microphone more than I was scared of the septic tank. At least the septic tank was private.*
