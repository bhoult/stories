# Chapter 28: Inventory

Day 43. I took inventory.

Not of supplies — Moss had those catalogued with a precision that made Maria's pantry look casual. The campus pharmacy basement held months of medications. The cafeteria stores, supplemented by the campus greenhouse that a botany grad student had been maintaining, provided adequate if monotonous calories. Water came from the campus wells. Power came from the solar array, most of it consumed by the emitter. The infrastructure was fragile but functional. The supplies weren't what I needed to count.

I needed to count us.

---

**Jim.** He was in decline and pretending he wasn't. The walk had taken something from him — not just sixty miles at seventy years old, but something deeper. Six weeks of being the person everyone leaned on had emptied reserves he couldn't refill. His color was off. His breathing was heavier than it had been. He'd started sitting more and standing less, and when he stood he put his hand on things — tables, door frames, the back of a chair — in the way of a man whose balance was negotiating with his body.

He didn't talk about it. He led prayers. He made coffee from the campus supply — real coffee, not instant, the first real coffee in six weeks, and the smell of it in the morning was a sacrament. He sat with Caleb on the steps of the science building and taught the boy to count his breaths, and Caleb counted — four in, hold, six out — with the careful concentration of a child who didn't fully understand why he was counting but trusted the person teaching him.

I watched Jim the way I watched everything. I noticed the hand on the door frame. I didn't say anything. Some observations are too expensive to share.

**Ruth.** Stable. Fragile. Her atenolol was resupplied, blood pressure managed, and her knees were the same knees they'd always been — grinding, aching, and walked on anyway. Ruth Fenn had been walking on bad knees for twenty years. The end of the world wasn't going to change her policy.

She'd found the campus library. This was, for Ruth, the equivalent of Marcus finding a functioning truck. She spent hours in the stacks — pulling books, reading, making notes in margins with a pencil she'd taken from the reference desk. She was cataloguing. I didn't ask what — Ruth's projects revealed themselves on her schedule, not on mine.

"The grammar in these biology textbooks is atrocious," she reported at dinner one night. "Split infinitives on every page. And the passive voice — 'it was observed that the specimen was affected by' — who observed? Who was affected? Science is no excuse for imprecision."

"You're copyediting biology textbooks at the end of the world," Sienna said.

"Someone has to maintain standards. Civilization may be collapsing but subject-verb agreement need not collapse with it."

**Dale and Maria.** They were rebuilding. Not the marriage — that had survived addiction, recovery, and apocalypse, and whatever was left was load-bearing. They were rebuilding routine. Dale carved in the mornings, taught recovery workshops in the afternoons — Moss's grad students attended, and Howard the janitor, who turned out to have twenty years of AA behind his mopping — and sat with Maria in the evenings while she organized whatever system she'd adopted that day.

Dale hadn't had a craving in two weeks. He found this suspicious.

"The craving always comes back," he said, carving a new animal — an owl, the eyes emerging from the cedar with the precision of a man whose steady hands were still novel enough to appreciate. "That's what recovery teaches you. The craving is dormant, not dead. It's waiting."

"Maybe this time it's different."

"It's never different. The context changes. The craving doesn't." He blew dust from the owl's face. "But the skills don't change either. When it comes back, I'll know what to do. Five minutes at a time."

Maria, beside him, was building a supply calendar on a whiteboard she'd requisitioned from a classroom. Dates, quantities, consumption rates, projected shortfalls. The campus's resources mapped as a timeline. She'd added a column for the emitter's declining effectiveness, the data from Moss's observations charted as a descending curve.

"We have approximately three months at current consumption," she said. "Assuming the emitter holds, which it won't, and assuming no additional survivors arrive, which they will."

"Maria, can we have one day without a countdown?"

"No. Countdowns are how we stay alive. If the Lyles had maintained a countdown, they'd have known when to leave." She looked at Dale. "I'll stop counting when there's nothing left to count."

**Marcus.** He was under the hood of a truck. A campus maintenance vehicle — a Ford F-250 with a diesel engine designed for hauling lawn equipment. Marcus didn't care about the original specs. It had an engine and wheels and a fuel tank. He'd been fixing things that moved for twenty years, and the end of the world was just another breakdown on the side of a long road.

He wasn't drinking. We all knew it the way we knew about Jim's health — noticed, not discussed. The anxiolytics from the pharmacy had bridged the withdrawal, and the bridge held. Now the bottle was gone and in its place was a wrench and a truck and the focused silence of a man who'd replaced one obsession with another and didn't care because the new one had a purpose.

He'd charged the phone the first night. Plugged it into a wall outlet in the dormitory hallway like it was the most ordinary act in the world, and when the screen lit up he'd stood there looking at it for a long time without saying anything. Ava's birthday photo. Purple frosting on her face, nine years old, laughing at whoever was holding the camera. He'd carried a dead phone for six weeks because putting it down would have meant putting her down, and now the screen was bright and her face was there and he could see her again and he stood in a hallway in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and looked at his daughter and didn't make a sound.

I know this because I walked past and saw him and kept walking. Some moments you don't interrupt. Some moments aren't yours.

**Caleb.** He was, remarkably, okay. Seven years old, orphaned, carried through a thousand Turned on a stranger's back, and he was drawing dinosaurs with crayons he'd found in a first-grade classroom in the education building and he was okay. Not undamaged — but okay the way children are okay when the adults around them are steady enough to build a floor. We were his floor. Dale's carvings, Marcus's stories, Jim's breathing lessons, Ruth's grammar corrections, Sienna's warmth, my presence — each of us a plank keeping Caleb above the water. He didn't know this. He didn't need to. He just needed to draw dinosaurs and hold the wooden beagle and fall asleep in someone's lap, and we provided these things because providing them was the only unambiguous good left in the world.

**Sienna.** She was running.

Running laps around the campus track — the university's outdoor oval, four hundred meters, visible from the science building's second floor. I watched her from the window. She ran in the mornings, alone, controlled, her breathing measured. She ran the way she'd trained before — stride long, arms pumping, the biomechanics of a state-qualifier in the 400-meter. But different. Slower. More deliberate. She was testing her limits, finding the line between exertion and activation, reclaiming the thing the organism had tried to take from her.

I watched her run laps and I thought about the edge — the dissolving she'd described, the warmth, the invitation to stop being yourself. She was running toward it now, then turning back, then toward it again. Each lap a calibration, each recovery a data point. She was building a map of her own threshold the way I'd built a map of the Turned's behavior — by observation, by iteration, by the willingness to approach the dangerous thing and document what you found.

She caught me watching once. Looked up at the window. I didn't look away. She didn't wave. The not-waving said enough — that the watching and the running were connected, that we were both working on the same thing: staying human in a world that was making it more expensive every day.

**Me.** I was different and I didn't know how. I'd lost weight — fifteen pounds, maybe, the walk stripping the excess the way water strips loose soil. My face looked different in the bathroom mirror of the dormitory — sharper, older, the softness replaced by something that wasn't hardness exactly but was adjacent to it. I was talking more. Deciding more. Standing in rooms where people looked at me as if I had answers, and sometimes I did and sometimes I didn't and the gap between those two states was closing.

I was not a hero. I was a fifteen-year-old with a responsibility I didn't want and a grief I couldn't process, dealing with both the only way I knew how: writing them down and trying to figure out what they meant.

What I was not doing was sleeping.

This was the thing I hadn't expected. In the trailer, on the trail, in the churches and campsites and exposed ridgelines — I'd slept badly, but I'd slept. The body's emergency systems kept sleep shallow, cycling through the lightest stages, ready to wake at any sound. Adrenaline and cortisol made a poor sedative but an effective alarm system. I'd spent six weeks in a state of perpetual half-rest, never dropping deep enough to dream fully, the animal brain keeping one ear open for the thing that might kill us.

Behind the emitter, in a real bed with a real mattress and a locked door and the frequency humming in the walls like a mechanical lullaby, my body finally let go. And everything I'd suppressed came flooding in.

The first night at the university, I had the worst nightmare of my life. Not the defining one — that had already broken me on the road — but worse because it was *comprehensive.* Complete, vivid, architectural. The trailer and the hospital and the roadblock and the septic tank and the herd — all of it, stitched together, the emitter's hum woven through every scene like a soundtrack, and in every scene I was too slow, too late, too small, and the people I loved were standing behind glass I couldn't break.

I woke at 3 AM with my heart at 114 and my hand already on my pulse and the counting was automatic now — 114, 108, 104, 98, 92, 86 — the descent taking longer than it used to because the dreams went deeper than the waking fears ever had. On the trail, the nightmares had been compressed, fragmented, starved of oxygen by the same adrenaline that kept me alive. In safety, they had room to breathe. They expanded. They furnished themselves. They took their time.

The second night was worse. The third was worse than that. By the fourth night I understood the paradox: the safest place I'd been since Day One was producing the most dangerous sleep of my life. My body, finally permitted to rest, was processing six weeks of unprocessed horror in high-definition, and each dream sent my heart rate climbing toward the threshold I'd spent six weeks learning to avoid.

I started sleeping with the blood pressure cuff on. Sienna's idea — the cuff was the watch rotation reduced to a single wrist, the whole protocol of checking and worrying and sitting in the dark watching people breathe, compressed into a pink inflatable band and a digital threshold. It beeped at 120, a failsafe, a mechanical ceiling. Three nights out of five, the beep woke me. I'd lie in the dark with the cuff inflating on my arm and the emitter humming in the walls and I'd count — four in, hold, six out — until the numbers came down, and then I'd stare at the ceiling and not sleep, because not sleeping was safer than sleeping, which was the same conclusion I'd reached in the trailer on Day One and which turned out to be true in every setting, in every bed, in every version of safety the world could offer.

I was not the only one. Marcus's dormitory door was open every morning — he slept with it open now, the enclosed space too much, the need for an exit route stronger than the need for privacy. Dale carved at 2 AM some nights, the knife and the wood and the muscle memory the only things that worked when the recovery dreams came back. Ruth's light was on at all hours. Even Sienna — who slept better than any of us, the runner's body efficient at recovery — told me once, quietly, that she dreamed about the dissolving. The edge. The warmth. And that in the dream, she didn't turn back.

Safety, it turned out, was when the bill came due.

From the campus perimeter, through the binoculars, I studied the Turned. The rooted stood at the four-hundred-yard line — the edge of the emitter's effective range — in a ring that was visible from any elevated point on campus. Hundreds of them, grey-green and motionless, feet embedded in the soil, root networks threading between them in dark webs across the ground. The population of Fayetteville and the surrounding area, accumulated over six weeks, drawn by the same instincts that had drawn them to the river valley and the highway interchanges — and then rooted in place, becoming permanent infrastructure, the organism's colony expanding in a ring around the campus like a besieging forest.

But I noticed things. The hunters — the two percent, the mobile ones — weren't just carrying food to the rooted anymore. Some of them were testing the perimeter. Moving in, retreating, moving in again. Crouching. The posture I'd first seen in the garden woman on Day One and had named *hunting* in the committee meeting — directed, purposeful, food-motivated. The emitter pushed them back, but the pushback was weaker here, at the edge, and the hunger was stronger than the discomfort. Moss had said hunting was metabolically driven, not communicatively driven. The emitter jammed the collective signal. It didn't jam the stomach. One of them made the bark — that short, sharp call — and two others, fifty yards apart along the perimeter, oriented and converged. Three hunters at the frequency edge, testing, probing, the caloric need overriding the disruption. They retreated after a few minutes, shaking their heads like dogs coming out of water. But they'd been closer than yesterday. And the root network was creeping closer too — I could see new tendrils pushing into the bare zone where the frequency had once kept the soil clear, the organism's wired connections advancing ahead of its wireless ones. The emitter's declining curve and the organism's ascending network were converging, and the intersection point was roots at our walls.

The rooted themselves were changing. The oldest ones — the first-week Turned, six weeks out — were less recognizably human than they'd been when we arrived. Their bodies were thickening, the skin darkening further, the limbs losing definition as the organism's growth subsumed the original form. They were becoming something else. Not dying. Growing. The organism didn't need the human shape anymore. It needed the human brain — the neuron — and the roots — the dendrites. Everything else was raw material.

This wasn't hope. The trajectory was growth. The organism wasn't dying. It was building.

I stood at the perimeter and watched the Turned sway at their line and I thought about time. The emitter's declining curve and the organism's ascending one and where they'd intersect. The medications that would run out and the knowledge that wouldn't. The people behind me — on the track, under the hood, in the library, at the whiteboard — rebuilding something that didn't have a name yet. Something you build when the old world is gone and the new one hasn't started and all you have is your skills and your damage and your willingness to keep writing things down.

I went inside to prepare for the broadcast.

Over breakfast that morning — real eggs, from chickens the botany grad student kept behind the greenhouse, the first real eggs in six weeks — Jim told me something. Casual. Smiling. The way Jim told everything, as if the telling were a gift he was handing you and the content were incidental to the giving.

"I had a dream last night," he said. Buttering toast. Not looking up. "A highway. Long, flat, one of those Texas ones that goes forever. A truck — a big rig, eighteen-wheeler — parked on the shoulder. And a little girl running toward it. Running fast, the way kids run when they see someone they love."

He took a bite of toast. Chewed. Swallowed.

"She was laughing," he said. "That's the part I remember. She was laughing and the sun was behind her and her shadow was longer than she was." He looked at me. The steady, luminous look. "It felt like a good dream. It felt like something that was going to happen."

Behind us, at the next table, Marcus went very still. His fork stopped halfway to his mouth. His face didn't change — the same flat, weathered expression he wore for everything — but his body went rigid in the way of a man who has just heard something impossible.

Ava was nine. She lived in Odessa, Texas. The highway Jim described was I-20 — the highway Marcus had driven ten thousand times, the highway that connected his routes to his daughter's birthday parties, the highway his phone had died on. Marcus had told no one about Ava except me, in a whisper, on a night when the dark was thick enough to hold a confession. Jim had never heard the name. Jim had never seen the photo on Marcus's phone. Jim had no way to know about a little girl in Texas or the highway that led to her.

Marcus set down his fork. He looked at Jim. Jim looked back. The look between them lasted three seconds and contained something I couldn't interpret and didn't try to.

"That's a good dream, Preacher," Marcus said. His voice was steady. His eyes were not.

Jim nodded. Went back to his toast. The morning continued. Nobody said anything else about it.

I wrote it in the journal. I underlined it twice. I had no interpretation — never had one for Jim's dreams. They operated somewhere my analytical brain couldn't reach, and his faith accepted them without needing them to make sense. Three dreams, now four. Water rising in a valley. A woman in a lab coat. A boy on a roof writing everything. A girl on a highway, laughing, running toward a truck.

Each one true. Each one impossible.

I underlined it a third time and turned the page.

Sienna found me in the hallway outside the radio room. I was sitting on the floor with the notebook open, reading my own handwriting, trying to figure out how to say the things I needed to say to people I couldn't see.

She sat down next to me. She'd been running — not the survival kind, the real kind. Moss had cleared a section of the track inside the emitter's perimeter and Sienna had been running it every morning, and the act of running without dying had done something for her that nothing else could. She was breathing hard and her skin was warm and she smelled like sweat and November air and the cheap soap from the university's emergency supplies.

"You ready?" she said.

"No."

"Good. Honest people live longer." Same thing she'd said on the morning we crossed Highway 21. A lifetime ago. Five weeks ago. Both.

She leaned her head against the wall. We sat in the hallway and didn't talk for a while. The hum of the emitter came through the floor. Somewhere downstairs, Caleb was laughing — an actual, genuine child's laugh, the first one I'd heard in weeks, and the sound of it went through me like sunlight through a window.

"Tell them about the Nesquik," she said.

"What?"

"The first night. In your trailer. The Nesquik and the canned milk. Tell them about that."

"Why would I tell them about that?"

"Because the people listening are alone. They've been alone for weeks. They're in their houses and their trailers and their basements and they haven't talked to anyone and they're running out of food and hope and they need to know that it's possible to sit in a kitchen with another person and drink something terrible and talk about your family and have it be — enough. Not a solution. Not a strategy. Just enough."

I looked at her. She looked at me. The hallway was empty and the emitter hummed and downstairs Caleb laughed again and Sienna's eyes were steady and certain and she was right, the way she was always right about the things that mattered, which were never the things I thought mattered.

"Okay," I said. "I'll tell them about the Nesquik."
