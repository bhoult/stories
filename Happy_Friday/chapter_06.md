# Chapter 6: Day Four, or How I Met Sienna

I woke on the hallway floor with a dead arm and a fever. The bite on my hand was swollen, red-streaked, hot. Cellulitis — the textbook was right about the timeline. I cleaned it with dish soap and wrapped it in a fresh sock and thought about the word *sepsis* and decided not to think about the word *sepsis*.

I was at the kitchen window eating peanut butter from the jar when the back door opened.

No knock. No warning. The handle turned and a girl was standing in the doorway with her hands raised, palms out. She was tall, lean, dark-skinned, hair pulled back in a knot, wearing track pants and a CLARKSVILLE PANTHERS hoodie. Her eyes were wide and her breath was fast but controlled — scared, not panicking.

"Don't scream," she whispered.

I was holding a spatula. I had grabbed it instinctively when the door opened, because apparently my survival reflexes had the tactical sophistication of a line cook. I was standing in mud-stained clothes with a swollen hand wrapped in a sock and a fever and a spatula, and Sienna Okafor was looking at me, and I became aware — suddenly, devastatingly — that I looked ridiculous. Fundamentally ridiculous.

"You're Nate," she said. "Delia's kid."

"Yeah."

My voice cracked. I'm being honest about everything in this journal, so: my voice cracked when a girl spoke to me on Day 4 of the apocalypse, because puberty doesn't pause for the end of the world.

She came in and closed the door — quietly, pressing it shut so the latch didn't click. We looked at each other and neither of us knew what to say because there is no social protocol for meeting your neighbor during the extinction of the human species.

"How did you get here?"

"Between the skirting panels. There's a gap between your trailer and Mrs. Watts's — you can move between lots under the trailers. I've been watching you."

"Watching me?"

"Watching everybody. You're the only one who watches back."

Sienna Okafor was seventeen. She ran the 400 and 800 for Clarksville High — state finals good, scholarship-talk good. Her parents had driven to Oklahoma City to get her brother Jaylen on Friday night. They hadn't come back.

She'd done what I'd done: watched. But she'd watched with different eyes. She could read the Turned's gait — which ones had been athletes, which ones were new arrivals based on coordination changes. She saw transitions where I saw positions. We were the same instrument tuned to different frequencies.

She was also the most distractingly present person I had ever been in a room with. My brain, which had been functioning as a passable survival computer for four days, immediately downgraded to a calculator with a dead battery. She moved through my kitchen with the economy of someone who'd spent her life in motion and I kept losing my train of thought mid-sentence because she'd turn her head or shift her weight and some useless ancient part of my brain would say *hey notice this* and I'd forget what I was saying and have to start over and she'd look at me like she knew exactly what was happening and was choosing not to comment on it, which was worse.

I am fifteen. I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds. I have never been on a date or kissed anyone or had a conversation with a girl that lasted more than two minutes without me finding a reason to leave. There are monsters outside and my mother is missing and something I don't understand is turning people into blank-faced herding machines. None of it matters to the part of my brain that has noticed that Sienna Okafor has very nice collarbones. I would like that part of my brain to shut up. It will not shut up. I am going to ignore it and focus on survival and hope that nobody ever reads this paragraph.

She had supplies from a Dollar General run — first aid, batteries, canned food. And a blood pressure cuff from the pharmacy aisle, pink, with a cartoon heart on the display.

"If the body is the variable," she said — she'd been thinking along the same lines I had, independently — "then we need to measure it. Heart rate, blood pressure. Data."

"That's what I've been —"

"I know. I saw your notebook through the window. You're measuring the wrong things. You're tracking their positions. You should be tracking ours."

She was right. And she'd arrived at it faster than me from less information, which produced a feeling I recognized from game theory: discovering that your model of the board is incomplete. In the prisoner's dilemma, the first move is to cooperate. Sienna was my first cooperator. The smart play was obvious. It was also terrifying because cooperation meant proximity, and proximity meant she would see me clearly, and that was a threat that had nothing to do with the Turned.

"Your hand," she said.

"It's fine."

"It's not fine. It's infected. You need —"

"I know what I need. I read the textbook."

"Then you know you need antibiotics, not a sock."

She wasn't wrong about this either and I hated it.

---

We argued. About everything. She paced while we argued — three steps to the counter, three steps back, her hands adjusting things that didn't need adjusting, unable to have a disagreement while stationary. She wanted to leave — find help, the National Guard, anyone with a plan. I wanted to stay and understand.

"We can't just sit here," she said. "The food runs out, the power's failing, and there's eleven of them out there and the number is going up."

"We leave and we die faster. You saw what happened to —"

"I saw. I also saw Jim walking around like it's Sunday morning. Whatever keeps him safe, we need to figure it out, and we're not going to figure it out in your kitchen."

"I am figuring it out. The textbook —"

"You've been *hiding.* There's a difference."

That landed. I'd been on the wrong side of the line between observing and hiding for four days and calling it strategy.

But the landing didn't stick. I had a reflex for this — a well-practiced move that deflected the blow before it could bruise. I did it without thinking: *I'm a hundred and eighty pounds. I can't run. I'm fifteen. What am I supposed to do — waddle out there and reason with them?* The self-deprecation was instant and complete and it felt like honesty, because it *was* honest — I really was fat, I really couldn't run, I really was fifteen — and the fact that it was honest made it invisible as a defense. You can't argue with someone's accurate self-assessment. You can only watch them use it as a reason to stay still.

She saw it on my face and didn't apologize. I respected that even as I wanted to crawl under the sink.

"I want to go back to the highway interchange," she said. "The military blockade. There were vehicles, equipment —"

"There were forty dead soldiers."

"There were forty *Turned* soldiers. And the vehicles they came in. Radios. Weapons. Medical supplies. We need those things."

"The interchange is a concentration point. You said it yourself — the highways funnel —"

"I said the perimeter collapsed. I didn't say the equipment disappeared."

This was Sienna's blind spot, and I would see it again: she defaulted to action the way I defaulted to analysis. Her instinct when trapped was to move, and moving was the thing most likely to kill her. She knew this — she'd watched it kill soldiers. But her body was built for the 400-meter sprint, not for sitting in a kitchen with a fat kid arguing about risk assessment while the world ended outside.

"Not yet," I said. "Not until we know more."

"You always want to know more. At some point you have to *do* something with what you know."

"And if what I know is that doing something will get you killed?"

She went quiet. Her jaw tightened. I watched her process this — the runner's frustration at being told not to run — and for a moment I thought she'd leave, just walk out the back door and go to the interchange herself, because that was the kind of person she was, the kind who'd rather be wrong and in motion than right and still.

She didn't leave. She closed her eyes, breathed, and when she opened them the fury had been replaced by something harder and more deliberate.

"I know what I am," she said quietly. "The gun fires and you go. That's been my whole life — the starter's pistol, the first stride, everything after is just physics. And now the gun fires and going is the thing that kills you, and I have to unlearn fifteen years of training in a week." She looked at her hands. "I'm working on it. But it's like asking a fish not to swim."

"Tell me what you know," she said.

---

She told me about the soldiers. I wanted to hear this. Part of me — the part still clinging to the movie — needed to hear that the military was out there, that the blockade was holding, that the system was functioning somewhere even if it hadn't reached us yet. The National Guard at the interchange was proof that somebody with authority and firepower was handling this. That was the last thread of the old framework: the cavalry exists, even if the cavalry is late.

"Six Humvees, two trucks. They set up at the interchange. Floodlights, barriers. Maybe forty soldiers."

Her hands were on the counter. I noticed they were shaking. This wasn't analysis anymore. This was memory costing her something.

"They engaged. Short bursts, disciplined. The Turned kept coming — you can hit one and it flinches and keeps walking. But the shooting was turning the soldiers. One dropped his weapon and stood there. Then another. Then three more. The combat was spiking their stress past whatever the line is, and the more they fought, the faster they crossed it. Twenty minutes. Forty soldiers. Gone."

She paused. Looked at the counter.

"The last one — a sergeant — he stopped shooting. Just stood there. Watched them walk toward him. And they walked right past him. He'd stopped fighting and they lost interest."

I sat with this. The last thread snapped. Forty soldiers with training and weapons and discipline, and the weapons were worse than useless — the combat itself turned them. The cavalry wasn't late. The cavalry was already gone. Nobody was coming. The people most equipped to fight were the most vulnerable, because fighting was the trigger.

"That sergeant figured it out," I said. "Under fire, in real time, he figured out that fighting was the problem. That takes —" I didn't have a word for what that took. Something harder than courage. Abandoning every instinct you have in the moment when those instincts are loudest.

Sienna was quiet for a while. Then she said something that had nothing to do with soldiers.

"I can't sit still. You know that. I'm a runner. My whole life is about moving, about doing, about — and now the thing that kills people is the thing my body is built for. The activation, the adrenaline, the physical intensity. My strengths are all liabilities. Everything I'm good at is trying to kill me."

She said this without self-pity — factually, with irritation. But underneath it I recognized something I'd felt from the opposite direction: the vertigo of discovering that the person you've been is the wrong person for the world you're in.

"I know," I said. "My thing is the opposite. I've been sitting still my whole life. Never thought it would be the useful version of me."

"It's not," she said. "Sitting still keeps you alive. It doesn't keep anyone else alive. You need to move eventually. You just need to figure out how to move without dying."

This was the beginning of us. Not the way I wanted it to be, but the way that actually mattered: two people with opposite broken pieces figuring out that the breaks fit together.

I handed her the blood pressure cuff.

"Test yourself," I said.

She strapped it on. Heart rate: 82. Blood pressure: 126/80. Higher than mine. The athlete's resting rate should have been lower than the couch potato's, but stress heart rate and resting heart rate are different systems, and Sienna was carrying a weight I wasn't: Jaylen, her parents, the fury of a body caged.

"We need to get that down," I said.

"Don't tell me to calm down."

"I wasn't going to. I was going to say that Jim walks outside every day and nothing happens to him and he's seventy years old with a bad heart, which means he's on medication that does chemically what you're trying to do through willpower. If we can figure out what he's taking —"

She looked at me. The expression was complicated — frustration, respect, the look people get when they realize the quiet kid in Lot 7 has been paying attention to things they missed.

"So we need to talk to Jim," she said.

"We need to talk to Jim."

Outside, the sun was going down. The Turned shifted their positions in that slow collective turn — tracking the sunset the way sunflowers track the horizon. Lisa Anderson was among them, face smooth and tilted toward the orange light.

We stayed up long into the night. I'm not going to narrate the whole conversation because some things are worth more as memories than as transcripts, but I want you to know it happened.

I talked about my mom. Not the ER nurse on night shift during the outbreak, not the probability calculation I'd been running since Saturday morning. The version where she lines up Saltines next to a Sprite before she leaves. Where she stumbles over her own last name on a voicemail and I never mention it. I told Sienna about the fears I'd been carrying — that the world was going to stay like this, that the systems weren't coming back, that every strategy I could think of ended in a timeline I couldn't survive alone. I told her this because that is what a strategist does when the map runs out: he names the dark squares so they stop being infinite.

She talked about Jaylen. The dinosaur quizzes. How he'd correct her with this gravity that only seven-year-olds can pull off, like the relative size of a Giganotosaurus was the most important fact in the universe. She talked about her parents and the drive to Oklahoma City and how she'd told her mom to text when they got there and her mom hadn't texted. She talked about running — how the 400-meter was her event because it was the perfect distance, long enough to require strategy but short enough to require fury, and how everything she'd built her life around was now the thing most likely to kill her. She said this without self-pity, the same way she said everything, but her hands were wrapped around her mug and they were tight.

We drank Nesquik mixed with canned evaporated milk, because that was what was left in the cabinet and neither of us wanted water. It was too sweet and slightly gritty and we both drank it slowly, not because it was good but because drinking it slowly meant the conversation lasted longer, and the conversation was the first interruption in the isolation either of us had felt in days, and we were not ready for it to end.

I'm not going to tell you what time we finally stopped talking. When we did, the trailer was less empty than it had been since Friday, and that's worth recording even if I can't measure it.

She took the couch. I took the hallway floor — my spot now, no windows, the narrowest part of the trailer where the walls were close enough to touch both sides. I lay there listening to the trailer settle and to the new sound layered over it: another person breathing.

Sometime after midnight I heard her twitch. A catch in her breath, then a sharp exhale, then the rustle of her shifting position. Then again, a few minutes later. A murmur that might have been "Jay" — the first syllable of a name she'd said seventeen times that evening. Her legs moved against the cushions, the runner's body running somewhere in the dark behind her eyes.

I lay on the hallway floor and listened and didn't go to her and didn't call out. In the morning she said nothing about it. I didn't ask. We were both carrying things that came out only when consciousness stepped aside, and the unspoken agreement — already, on the first night — was that we would not name each other's ghosts.

Tomorrow we would cross Highway 21.
