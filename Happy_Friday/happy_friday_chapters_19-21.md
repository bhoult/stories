# Chapter 19: The First Mile

The Ozark Highlands Trail does not believe in flat.

We rode bicycles to the trailhead. Eight people on eight bikes, pedaling twenty miles of two-lane blacktop through the Ozark foothills, packs strapped to rear racks and handlebars and, in my case, balanced on my lap like a pregnant belly made of nylon and poor decisions. Ruth and Jim had the e-bikes — Ruth because her knees couldn't pedal twenty miles, Jim because he was seventy-three and nobody argued with Ruth about getting one so nobody could argue with Jim either. Caleb rode on Marcus's handlebars, gripping the crossbar with both hands, the wooden beagle in his jacket pocket bumping against the frame.

The road was empty. Three weeks of no traffic and the pavement was already changing — leaves in the gutters, a branch down in the right lane, the first cracks where tree roots were starting to reclaim what asphalt had borrowed. We passed houses. Some had Turned in the yards — the head-turns tracked us as we pedaled past, the smiles following, but bikes were fast enough that none of them transitioned beyond passive interest. We passed Clarksville's city limit sign and the Dollar General and the shuttered Sonic Drive-In and the world we were leaving behind.

We reached the trailhead at midday — a gravel parking area off Forest Service Road 1003. The parking area was empty. No cars, no Turned. The first good sign in three weeks.

We leaned the bikes against a split-rail fence at the edge of the lot. Eight bicycles, two of them still showing a charge on their battery indicators. Machines we'd never use again. Marcus looked at them for a moment — the particular look of a man who'd spent his life around vehicles, who understood the value of anything with wheels — and then turned away. We were leaving the world of wheels. Everything after this was feet.

The trailhead marker was a brown post with a white blaze — an aluminum diamond nailed to the wood, catching the November light. Beyond it, the trail entered the forest like a thread being pulled into fabric: a two-foot-wide path of packed earth and leaf litter, climbing immediately, switchbacking up a hardwood hollow toward a sandstone ridge that was invisible from below.

"That's up," Caleb said. He was holding Dale's hand. Dale had given him the beagle to carry in his jacket pocket and Caleb had his other hand on the beagle and he was looking at the trail the way a seven-year-old looks at something that is clearly, obviously, unfairly tall.

"That's up," Marcus confirmed.

"All of it?"

"Most of it."

Caleb looked at me. I don't know why he looked at me — maybe because I was the biggest person who also clearly didn't want to walk uphill, and solidarity with the reluctant is comforting at any age.

"I don't want to," he said.

"Me neither, buddy. Let's go."

---

The first mile climbed six hundred feet. I know this because Marcus told me, and I know Marcus told me because I asked, and I asked because I am the kind of person who wants to quantify suffering, as if knowing the exact gradient of the switchback will make my lungs burn less. It does not.

Oak leaves covered the trail — ankle-deep, dry, hiding every root and rock beneath them. The path switchbacked up the hollow in tight turns, gaining elevation through a forest of white oaks and hickories that were shedding their canopy in sheets of bronze and amber. The leaves crunched under eight pairs of feet. Below us, through the thinning trees, the lowland we'd left fell away into haze.

The order of march: Marcus in front, because he'd crossed these ridgelines by road and had the best instinct for terrain. Then Sienna, setting pace, her stride shortened to match Ruth's but still fluid, still the athlete's economy. Then Jim and Ruth, side by side, Jim's hand occasionally steadying Ruth's elbow on the steeper grades. Then Dale and Caleb, Dale's knife out and a piece of wood in his other hand, carving as he walked, the shavings falling behind him like breadcrumbs. Then Maria, who walked with the precise, metronomic pace of a woman who had decided that sixty miles was a logistical problem and was solving it one step at a time.

Then me.

I was last because I was slowest. This was not a strategic decision. It was physics. A hundred and eighty pounds going uphill on legs that had never climbed anything steeper than the stairs to the school library, with thirty-two pounds of pack shifting on my back like a drunk passenger. The hip belt dug into the tops of my hip bones — a grinding pressure that started as discomfort and became pain within the first half mile. The shoulder straps pulled backward, hauling at my collarbones, making me lean forward on the uphills until my center of gravity was somewhere in front of my knees and every step felt like catching a fall. My back was soaked. The pack trapped heat against my spine and the sweat had nowhere to go and by the second switchback my shirt was plastered to my skin and the shirt was rubbing against the pack frame in a way that would, by nightfall, produce a raw stripe across both shoulder blades that would hurt for five days.

By the first switchback I was breathing hard. By the second I was sweating through my shirt despite the cold. By the third I was making sounds that were technically breathing but sounded more like a large animal being slowly inflated. And somewhere around the third switchback my inner thighs began to chafe — the fabric of my jeans, damp with sweat, grinding against skin with every step, a specific humiliation I was not going to mention to anyone, least of all Sienna, who was walking thirty yards ahead with the easy stride of a person whose body was designed for this.

I threw up on the fourth switchback. Just leaned over, hands on knees — the pack nearly tipping me forward onto my face — and threw up my breakfast onto the leaves beside the trail. Sienna glanced back. She didn't stop. She didn't comment. She looked, assessed that I wasn't dying, and kept walking.

This was the nicest thing she'd ever done for me.

I kept walking. Not because I'd overcome the nausea or the pain or the specific grinding misery of the chafing. Because the anger wouldn't let me stop. The anger I'd brought from Clarksville — from the hospital parking lot, from the truck ride back, from the laps around the church — was the only engine I had that didn't require oxygen. My lungs burned. My legs screamed. The anger said: *good. You earned this. You sat at a window while Lisa Anderson was taken. You sat in a basement while your mother stood in a parking lot with bare feet. The pain is what you owe.* And the pain became something I leaned into rather than something I endured, and the leaning-in looked like grit but it wasn't grit, it was punishment, and the punishment kept me moving when grit would have let me sit down.

Somewhere on the fifth switchback, Sienna dropped back. She'd been thirty yards ahead, setting pace, but now she was beside me, matching my labored stride.

"Hey," she said. "You okay?"

"Fine." I was not fine. I was covered in sweat and vomit residue and the inside of my thighs felt like they'd been rubbed with sandpaper and I was furious at everything that existed.

"You've got that look."

"What look."

"The one where you're three zip codes deep in your own head and you forgot to leave a forwarding address." She bumped her shoulder against my arm — a light contact, almost playful. Different from the fierce girl who'd walked laps with me at the church. Softer. "Talk to me."

"Nothing to talk about."

She studied me for a moment — the assessing look, the one I recognized from her reprimand speech, except this time it was gentler, searching rather than challenging. She didn't find what she was looking for.

"Okay," she said. She dropped back to her pace position. The trail went up. I followed.

Ruth was slow. Her knees — she'd mentioned them, dryly, in the way she mentioned all her physical limitations, as facts to be noted and then ignored — ground audibly on the steep sections, a sound like sand in a joint. Jim stayed with her, matching her pace exactly, his hand appearing at her elbow on the switchbacks and disappearing on the straights, the automatic choreography of a man who had spent a career walking beside people who needed him.

Caleb fell twice. The first time he tripped on a root hidden under leaves and went down hard, skinning both palms. He cried — briefly, sharply, the cry of a child who is hurt but not broken — and Dale picked him up and brushed the leaves off and said "What do we do when we fall?" and Caleb, still sniffling, said "Get up" and Dale said "That's right" and they kept walking. The second time was on a rock scramble near the ridgeline where the trail crossed exposed sandstone. Caleb's shoe slipped and he slid three feet before Marcus caught him — one hand, casual, the reflexes of a man who'd been catching things that slid for twenty years.

Dale's hands were shaking. Not the cold — the Suboxone. He'd taken his last dose that morning. The withdrawal wouldn't hit fully for another twelve to twenty-four hours, but the edge of it was there — a tremor in the fingers, a tightness in the jaw. He carved as he walked, and the carving was a little rougher than usual, the strokes a little less controlled, and I watched him the way I watched everything: from behind, measuring, cataloguing, unable to help.

---

On the last rock scramble before the ridge, Marcus stopped and cut a length of river cane from a thicket beside the trail — five feet long, thumb-thick, the kind of cane that grew along every creek bottom in the Ozarks. He stripped the leaves and handed it to Ruth.

"Walking stick," he said. "Use it."

Within an hour everyone had one. Marcus cut them from cane and small hardwood saplings, sizing each to the user. The difference was immediate — a third point of contact on the rocky sections, something to brace against on the steep descents, a way to test footing before committing weight. I hadn't known I needed one until I had it. Then I couldn't imagine walking without it.

We made the ridgeline by late afternoon. Seven hours for three miles. In the old world, an hour's walk. In this world, an odyssey.

The ridgeline opened up. The trail ran along the spine of the ridge, sandstone outcrops on both sides, the forest canopy thinning to let the sky through. And the sky was — I don't have the word. I'd been looking at sky through steeple louvers and kitchen windows for three weeks. This was sky without a frame. Huge and blue and cold, the late-autumn clarity that comes to the Ozarks in November when the humidity dies and the air turns to glass.

To the east, the river valley spread out below us — thirty miles of lowland, the river a silver thread, the towns invisible at this distance but present as smudges of grey where the roads converged. Down there, the world was ending. From up here, you couldn't tell. The valley looked the way it had looked for ten thousand years: patient, indifferent, the land not caring what happened on its surface.

To the west, more ridgelines. Rolling, forested, extending to the horizon in diminishing blue layers like a painting of itself. The OHT ran along those ridgelines — we could see the next rise, and the one after that, and the one after that, each one a day's walk, each one a promise and a threat.

The forest was quiet.

Not the quiet of the town — not the held-breath silence of a world monitoring itself for danger. This was living quiet. Wind in the remaining canopy leaves, a dry rattle that sounded like paper. A creek somewhere below, audible only as a texture in the air. The skitter of a squirrel or chipmunk in the underbrush — a real animal, doing real animal things, unbothered by the end of human civilization.

No Turned.

The population density up here was zero before the outbreak. The terrain — steep, rocky, pathless off-trail — was hostile to the collective behavior. The organism coordinated on flat ground and in built environments. Dense forest with ravines and bluffs broke the signal, scattered the herd, turned the Turned back into confused individuals who wandered rather than hunted. Marcus had been right. The mountains were empty.

"Camp here," Marcus said. He'd found a bluff overlook — a sandstone shelf jutting out from the ridge, fifteen feet wide, protected on three sides by rock and forest. The view ran east into the valley. The bluff face dropped fifty feet — nothing was climbing up. The trail continued along the ridge behind us, the only approach a narrow path through thick undergrowth.

We made camp. Marcus and Sienna strung tarps between trees at the edge of the bluff — the lightweight ones from Atwoods, rigged with paracord, angled to shed rain and block wind. We rolled out sleeping pads on the rock — thin foam, not much padding, but insulation between body and stone. The pads were narrow. The rock was uneven. Sleeping would be a generous description for whatever happened on those pads tonight, but they were better than bare sandstone, which was like sleeping on a cold shelf in a walk-in cooler.

Ruth sat on the folding camp chair Maria had insisted on carrying — three pounds of aluminum that Maria had defended against every objection about weight with the flat declaration "Ruth sits or Ruth doesn't walk tomorrow." Dale carved. The wood he was working was cedar — aromatic, reddish, he'd picked it up at the trailhead — and the smell of cedar shavings mixed with the cold stone and leaf rot of the ridge and made something that smelled like a world that was still possible.

We ate freeze-dried beef stew reconstituted with creek water heated on the camp stove. The portions were small. The portions were always going to be small. I could have eaten three of them and still wanted more. Everyone ate carefully, slowly, making the meal last, because making it last was the only way to pretend it was enough.

After dinner, the conversation nobody wanted to have: gear.

"We packed too much," Marcus said. He was looking at the pile of equipment we'd hauled up six hundred vertical feet. The extra water containers — unnecessary, since every hollow had a creek. The camp shovel. The hatchet handles that duplicated the ones on our belts. The second cooking pot. The heavy canned goods Maria had added as backup. Dale's second tarp. The extra paracord. "Every ounce we carry tomorrow, we carry up another ridge. And the ridge after that. For sixty miles."

The math was brutal: thirty-two pounds felt manageable in the church parking lot. It was not manageable on a switchback. My shoulders were bruised. My hips were raw. Ruth had barely made three miles, and her pack was the lightest.

We went through everything. The psychology of discarding was harder than the weight itself — everything felt essential until you'd carried it uphill. The shovel felt essential. The extra water felt essential. The big cans of soup that weighed twice what the freeze-dried meals weighed felt essential because they were *food* and food was the thing you thought about constantly and the thought of leaving food behind was physically painful.

We left the shovel. The extra water containers. The second pot. The heavy cans — we ate what we could that night, added them to the stew, forced ourselves full. Two of the three tents went; we'd keep one for Ruth and Caleb and sleep under tarps. The redundant paracord. A bag of tools nobody had used. By the time we were done, the discard pile looked like a yard sale on a sandstone shelf, and the packs were five pounds lighter, and five pounds was the difference between arriving and not.

"All you think about when you're walking is food," Marcus said, watching the pile. "All you think about when you're resting is gear. What you can drop. What you don't need. That's hiking. That's the whole thing."

Jim held a prayer. Short: "Thank you for this day. Thank you for these legs. Particularly Ruth's, which performed heroically."

Ruth: "My legs do not require divine commentary."

Jim: "They're getting it anyway."

Marcus lit a small fire — carefully, in a depression in the rock, the smoke rising into the canopy and dispersing. "No population up here," he said. "Nothing to attract. And the smoke disperses in the canopy before it clears the trees." He'd built fires on overnight hauls, sleeping by the side of his truck. He knew which fires were safe and which weren't, the same way he knew which roads flooded and which ridgelines were exposed.

Caleb fell asleep in Dale's lap, the beagle in one hand and the half-finished cardinal in the other. Dale's hands shook and he held the boy steady and the tremor in his hands didn't travel to the child, and the effort of keeping the two things separate — the shaking and the holding — was visible in his face as a tightness that nobody mentioned.

Marcus pointed at the sky. "Orion," he said. To Caleb, who was asleep and couldn't hear. "Rising in the east. See the belt — three stars in a line. And there —" He pointed. "The Pleiades. Seven sisters. My dispatcher used to call me the seventh sister because I was always the last one in." He said this to the sleeping boy and to nobody else, and the constellations were there — brighter than I'd ever seen them, brighter than I knew stars could be, because there was no light pollution for fifty miles in any direction and the sky was doing the thing it had always been doing and we'd just been too busy to see.

We talked for a long time that night. Not about the trail or the plan or the Turned — about before. Ruth told us about her husband, Gerald, who had died in 2019, and how he'd made the worst coffee in Johnson County and she'd drunk it every morning for forty-one years and never told him. Marcus described the first time he saw Ava walk — three steps from the coffee table to the couch, arms out, face split with a grin that was nothing like the grin the Turned wore because it was real, it was *for* something, and the difference between a smile that means joy and a smile that means nothing is the entire distance between us and them. Maria talked about growing up in El Paso and how her mother had organized the kitchen by color and how she'd thought it was crazy until she grew up and organized everything by system and realized she was her mother's daughter after all.

Jim said, "My wife's name was Eleanor. Not the same Eleanor. She made peach cobbler that could make you believe in God." That was all he said about her. It was enough.

Sienna leaned against my shoulder at some point and neither of us acknowledged it. The fire had burned low and the warmth was on one side and the November cold was on the other and the shoulder contact was a small, specific thing that didn't mean anything except that it meant everything.

"What are you thinking about?" she asked. Quiet. Just for me.

"Nothing."

"You're a bad liar." She said it without the sharpness — without the reprimand voice, the fierce-eyed challenge. She said it like someone who was worried. "You've been somewhere else all day. Even on the switchbacks. Like — you were there, but you weren't."

I almost told her. Almost said: *I'm angry all the time and I don't know what to do with it and the anger is the only reason I made it up the mountain today and that scares me.* But telling her would mean explaining the parking lot and explaining the parking lot would mean saying *my mother* out loud and saying it out loud would make it real and I wasn't ready and the anger said I didn't need to be ready because ready was another word for soft.

"I'm tired," I said. "First day."

She studied me. Then she let it go — not because she believed me, but because she understood that pushing wouldn't work. Not tonight. She settled her head back against my shoulder and stayed.

I am putting this in the journal because the journal should contain the truth, and the truth is that I was sitting on a rock in the Boston Mountains at eleven o'clock at night with a girl's head on my shoulder and the Milky Way overhead and I was happy. Briefly, unsustainably, illogically happy. And underneath the happiness, the anger was still there, patient and dense, waiting for the happiness to pass. It passed. The anger didn't. And I want both of those things on the record.

I wrote by firelight. The notebook was wrinkled from the septic tank and smelled faintly of things I wouldn't name. The pen was a ballpoint from Ruth's purse. The fire popped and the smoke rose and the stars were out and behind us the trail continued into the dark, climbing the next ridge, and the next, and the next.

I crawled into my sleeping bag on the foam pad and every muscle in my body announced its displeasure. Legs. Back. Shoulders. The specific, grinding ache of muscles that had been used for the first time and were now stiffening in the cold, contracting, turning into concrete. The pad kept me off the rock but didn't do much else — I could feel every contour of the sandstone through the foam, and the bag was warm enough but narrow, and I couldn't find a position where something wasn't pressing against something else.

The forest was not quiet. I'd thought forests were quiet — the peaceful silence of nature, the soothing sounds of the wild. This was a lie invented by people who had never slept in one. Something large crashed through the dead leaves thirty feet from camp — loud, thrashing, the sound of a body moving through undergrowth with no regard for stealth. My heart rate jumped before Marcus said, from his post by the fire, "Possum." A possum. A five-pound marsupial that sounded like a bear stampede when it walked through dry oak leaves. An armadillo followed twenty minutes later — the same thrashing, the same cardiac event, the same eventual identification. Then deer, their hooves cracking sticks in the dark. Then something unidentified that rustled and stopped and rustled and stopped and I never found out what it was and lay in the dark imagining options until my body surrendered to exhaustion and the imagination shut off.

We all smelled like smoke and sweat. The fire provided warmth for whoever was on watch — Marcus took first shift, Jim second — but the smoke got into everything. Hair. Sleeping bags. Clothes. The smell would be our constant companion. I'd stop noticing it by Day 3.

That night I dreamed I was in the trailer. Everything was right — the paneling, the counter, the burn mark. But the trailer was moving. Not on wheels — being dragged, the whole structure shuddering, the floor tilting, and through the kitchen window the trees were not the park's trees but the OHT forest, oaks and hickories scrolling past as the trailer was pulled through terrain it was never built for. I could hear the skirting tearing underneath, the vinyl shredding against rock, and I ran to the back door and opened it and the drop was not the gravel lot but a ravine, a hundred feet of empty air, and the trailer was sliding toward the edge and I couldn't stop it because you can't stop a house.

I woke to the sound of wind in the canopy and for three heartbeats I didn't know which world was real — the forest or the trailer — and my hand found my wrist and counted and the count was high, one-ten, one-oh-six, and I lay still and watched the fire embers and breathed until the numbers came down and the trailer dissolved and I was on a rock in the Boston Mountains and the stars were the only things that hadn't changed.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #13:**

*The trail is hard. Ruth is struggling. Caleb fell twice. I threw up on the second switchback and —*

*I was going to write "Sienna pretended not to notice, which is the nicest thing she's ever done for me." But I caught myself. The joke. The self-deprecating deflection. The bit where I'm the fat kid who can't handle a switchback and isn't it funny. Sienna told me to stop building the case for my own helplessness and I'm still doing it, automatically, the way you bite your nails — not because you decide to but because the hand finds the mouth before the brain intervenes.*

*So here's what actually happened: I threw up on the fourth switchback and then I kept walking. I kept walking because stopping wasn't an option and because the pack on my back was the heaviest pack in the group — thirty-two pounds that ground my hips raw and bruised my shoulders and turned my inner thighs into a chafing disaster I will never discuss with anyone — and I was carrying it because I could, because my body — the one I've been apologizing for since page one of this notebook — carried thirty-two pounds up a mountain switchback and didn't stop. The throwing up was what happened. The not-stopping was what I did. Those are different things. I'm trying to learn the difference.*

*I have identified a motivational resource I did not previously have access to. That's how I'm going to describe it in this journal because describing it accurately would require writing words I'm not ready to see in my own handwriting. The resource makes uphills easier. It makes the pack lighter. It converts physical pain into something I can use rather than something I endure. I don't know if it's sustainable and I don't know if it's healthy and right now I don't care because it kept me on the trail when everything else wanted me to stop.*

*Nothing tried to kill us today. Nothing used a familiar voice. Nothing stood in a parking lot wearing someone's face. The forest is empty of the thing that's ending the world, and the emptiness is the closest thing to safety we've found.*

*Dale is starting withdrawal. I can see it in his hands. He held Caleb through it and the boy didn't feel the shaking and I don't know how Dale did that but it's the bravest thing I've seen anyone do and I've seen Sienna sprint through a herd of Turned carrying a seven-year-old.*

*From the ridge you can see the valley. Down there, the world is ending. Up here, the oaks are going bronze and the stars are out and it's the most peaceful I've felt in a month. I think this is what normal is going to feel like for a while: exhausting and terrifying and better than the alternative.*

*We dumped five pounds of gear tonight. The shovel, the extra water, heavy cans, a tent. Everything feels essential until you've carried it up six hundred vertical feet. Then you'd leave your own shoes behind if they weighed an ounce less.*

*Fifty-seven miles of trail to go, then another thirty-five on the highway. At today's pace, three miles a day, the math is catastrophic. Ruth's medication runs out before we get there. But Marcus says the pace builds — that bodies adapt, that the first day is always the worst. The math never quite works. We walk anyway.*

# Chapter 20: The Trail

The second morning was worse than the first.

Not the walking — the getting up. Every muscle had stiffened overnight, the cold ground and the exhaustion conspiring to turn human bodies into something closer to wood. I sat up on the foam pad and my back seized and my legs cramped and my shoulders — bruised from the pack straps — screamed when I tried to push myself upright. Ruth couldn't stand without Jim pulling her up. Dale's hands were shaking hard enough that he couldn't grip the zipper on his sleeping bag. Caleb was the only one who bounced up without complaint, because seven-year-olds are made of rubber and injustice.

The stiffness faded as we walked. This was the first of many things the trail taught by repetition: the body lies in the morning. It says *you can't do this.* You do it anyway, and within a mile the joints loosen and the muscles warm and the lie becomes yesterday's pain rather than today's impossibility. By the third day I stopped believing the morning. By the fifth I stopped noticing it.

---

Days on the trail settled into a rhythm that was neither comfortable nor unbearable — just relentless.

The mornings were the same: stiff, cold, sore. Pack up the tarps and pads, stuff the sleeping bags, eat something — usually a handful of trail mix or a packet of instant oatmeal cooked on the camp stove with creek water. Never enough. The food was never enough. Freeze-dried meals were light and compact and tasted like salted nothing and the portions were designed for recreational hikers who would eat a real dinner afterward, not for people whose dinner was another freeze-dried packet. We ate everything heavy first — the canned goods that had survived the gear purge, the denser bars — to lighten the packs as quickly as possible. By Day 4, the packs were lighter. The hunger was not.

All you think about when you're walking is food. What you ate, what you'll eat, what you wish you were eating. Marcus talked about truck-stop diners — chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, coffee that was always too hot and never strong enough. Ruth described Gerald's meatloaf in a level of detail that should have been illegal. Caleb requested, repeatedly, "chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs." The conversations happened on the downhill, when breathing was easier. On the uphills, nobody spoke. The uphills were for breathing and suffering and the specific mental blankness that comes from putting one foot in front of the other on a forty-degree grade with twenty-five pounds on your back.

The trail was roots and rocks and more roots. The white blazes — aluminum diamonds nailed to trees — marked the path, and Marcus read them instinctively, the way he read road signs. Where the blazes faded or the path split, he stopped and studied the ground — boot prints, worn bark, the subtle compression of soil that said *people walked here* — and chose, and was always right. The trail crossed creeks every few miles, sometimes on stepping stones, sometimes on fallen logs, sometimes through the water itself.

The creek crossings were their own ordeal. The water was cold — November cold, the kind that made your bones ache on contact. The rocks were mossy and slippery and rounded in ways that invited exactly the wrong kind of trust. The protocol was: stop. Remove shoes and socks. Roll up pants or, if the crossing was deep, strip to underwear. Bag your dry clothes. Cross barefoot or in camp sandals, using the hiking poles for balance, helping each other across. Get to the far side, dry your feet, check for cuts, put on dry socks — carefully, no wrinkles, no pebbles, because a wrinkle in a sock becomes a blister in a mile and a blister becomes a limp in a day and a limp becomes the difference between making distance and not.

We became obsessive about socks. Socks were currency. Dry socks were gold. We carried extras in ziplock bags and we changed them at every crossing and we inspected our feet at every stop and the inspection was serious, meticulous, the way Maria was meticulous about everything — because a blister on Ruth's heel or a hot spot on Dale's arch was not a minor inconvenience. It was a pace reduction for the whole group and a medication timeline that tightened with every lost mile.

Sienna did not get blisters. Sienna's feet were the feet of a distance runner — callused, tough, accustomed to punishment. She crossed the creeks with the sure-footed grace of a person whose body and the terrain were on speaking terms. The rest of us plodded. Sienna sauntered.

At a creek crossing on Day 4, she brought me water. I was sitting on a rock on the far side, drying my feet, the routine sock inspection, and she appeared with her water bottle and held it out without saying anything. I'd drunk all of mine on the last uphill. She'd noticed. I hadn't asked.

"Thanks," I said.

"You push too hard on the uphills," she said. Not a reprimand — an observation. Different voice. "You don't have to punish yourself up every grade. A slower pace covers the same distance."

"I'm not punishing myself."

"You are, though." She sat beside me on the rock, pulling her socks on. Her hands were efficient, practiced — the sock smooth, no wrinkles, the motion automatic. "You walk like you're trying to hurt yourself. Like the pain is the point. It's not the point, Nate. The point is getting there."

I didn't answer because she was right and I didn't want her to be right and the anger said: *the pain IS the point. The pain is what you owe. Getting there is what you owe them.* She waited for an answer that didn't come, then touched my shoulder — briefly, lightly, the way you'd touch someone who might flinch — and went back to her position in the line.

She'd been doing this. Small things. The water. A hand on my arm at a steep descent. Walking beside me on the downhills even when the trail narrowed, talking about nothing — her track coach's obsession with split times, the specific physics of a 400-meter race, how the third turn was where you either committed or died. She was trying to pull me out of wherever I'd gone. She could see I was somewhere she couldn't reach, and her instinct — the same instinct that made her sprint through a herd of Turned to save Caleb — was to close the distance.

I let her talk. I gave her the half-smile she was looking for. The anger stayed where it was.

---

Dale was bad by Day 3.

The Suboxone had been gone for two days and the withdrawal was no longer a tremor in the hands. It was a full systemic event — sweating despite the cold, muscles cramping, a nausea that bent him double every thirty minutes. The textbook described opioid withdrawal as "profoundly uncomfortable but rarely life-threatening." The textbook had not considered a context where the symptoms of withdrawal — the anxiety spike, the autonomic activation, the flood of stress hormones — were the exact biochemical signature that could convert you from human to infrastructure.

We managed it. Propranolol for the heart rate. Clonazepam for the acute anxiety. Jim's breathing exercises, which Dale performed with the grim determination of a man who had spent twelve years in recovery and was not going to let pharmacology undo it. But the management was imperfect. Dale's resting heart rate was 94 — higher than anyone's in the group, dangerously close to the range where the organism might start paying attention.

He walked. He carved. The cedar piece had become a fox — ears back, body low, running. The strokes were rougher on the uphills, when the exertion layered on top of the withdrawal and his hands shook worse, but the shape was there. His hands shook and the fox emerged anyway.

The trail and the withdrawal were the same thing. Both were survived by putting one foot in front of the other. Both punished you for stopping. Both lied to you — told you the pain was permanent, told you the suffering was the destination rather than the road. Dale had been doing this for twelve years. The trail was just a new surface for the same walk.

"Rock bottom was just training," he said, on the fourth night, sitting by the fire with the fox in his hands. "Turns out every meeting I went to, every check-in, every time I sat with a craving and didn't use — I was practicing for this. The craving is the same thing. The fear, the chemical demand, the body screaming at you to do the thing that will kill you because it feels like relief. Same mechanism. Different substance."

That night he taught us HALT.

"Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired," he said. The fire was small — a depression in sandstone, the smoke threading up into the canopy. Dale's hands were shaking but his voice was steady — the voice he'd used in meetings, in the daily practice of staying alive. "You don't make decisions in those states. Any of those states. Your brain lies to you when you're hungry. It lies differently when you're angry. And when you're tired — when you're exhausted and scared and the whole world is wrong — your brain will tell you the stupidest idea you've ever had is the only option."

He looked around the fire. "How many of you are hungry right now?"

Everyone.

"Angry?"

Ruth raised her hand. Maria almost did.

"Lonely?"

Nobody raised their hand. Nobody needed to.

"Tired?"

Everyone.

"That's four for four. You're all in HALT right now. Every decision you make tonight is compromised. So here's what we do: we don't make decisions tonight. We eat, we sleep, we make decisions tomorrow when at least one of those four is resolved. In recovery we call this 'urge surfing' — you ride the urge without acting on it. The urge passes. It always passes. The bad decision doesn't."

He paused. The fire popped.

"Tired is the most dangerous of the four," he said. "Tired is the one that feeds the others. You can manage hunger, you can manage anger, you can manage loneliness — if you're rested. But tired means sleep, and sleep means your chemistry goes unsupervised. In recovery, we relapse at night. In this —" He gestured at the dark beyond the fire. "In this, tired means the watch rotation matters more than anything. The person who stays awake so the rest of us can sleep is the person who keeps the chemistry supervised. The most important job we have is the one nobody wants — sitting in the dark, watching people breathe, making sure nobody's brain decides to betray them while they're dreaming."

Jim, from his side of the fire: "That sounds like faith."

Dale looked at him. "It sounds like data. The relapse rate for decisions made in HALT states is over seventy percent. That's not faith. That's statistics."

"Statistics and faith aren't —"

"Mutually exclusive," the group said, more or less in unison, and Jim laughed — a real laugh, surprised and warm — and the fire popped and the stars turned and we didn't make any decisions.

On Day 5, the trail crossed Highway 23. A road crossing — the exposed moments Marcus had warned about. We descended from the ridgeline in the late morning, glassed the highway from the tree line, saw two Turned drifting a quarter mile south, waited until they'd moved further off, then crossed the pavement at a fast walk. Forty seconds of exposure. The asphalt felt alien underfoot after days of packed earth and rock.

Then the climb. The trail went straight up — steeper than anything we'd done, a relentless grade that switchbacked through hardwoods and then hit bare rock, hand-over-hand scrambling on sandstone ledges with packs threatening to pull us backward off the mountain. Ruth needed help. Marcus took her pack. Jim took her arm. She climbed with her teeth set and her walking stick jammed into every crevice and the sound of her knees was audible over the wind.

Near the top, the trail leveled and passed through a thicket of cedars, and the Rock House Shelter appeared.

It was built into the bluff — a massive natural rock overhang, thirty feet deep and sixty feet wide, the sandstone ceiling curving overhead like the inside of a wave frozen in stone. In the back, a spring seeped from the rock face, the water trickling down into a shallow basin someone had carved or enlarged generations ago. And across the front of the overhang, stacked stone walls — three walls with three doorways, the stones fitted without mortar, built by loggers in the early 1900s who had worked these mountains with crosscut saws and mule teams and needed somewhere to sleep. Some sections had collapsed — a pile of tumbled stones on the east end, a gap in the west wall where a tree root had pushed through. But the structure was mostly intact. Flat cement floor. A fire pit, blackened with a century of use. The ceiling was smoked dark from a hundred years of campfires.

"Oh," Ruth said. She said it the way you'd say it if you'd been sleeping on cold sandstone for four nights and someone showed you a room with a floor and a roof.

We stayed two nights. Marcus made the call — we were ahead of the medication schedule, barely, and Ruth needed recovery time and Dale needed the spring water and the flat floor and all of us needed the specific mercy of a place that wasn't open to the sky.

The shelter was dry when the rain came. It came on the second afternoon — a cold November storm, the kind the Ozarks produce without warning, the temperature dropping ten degrees in an hour and the rain falling in sheets that turned the trail into a creek. We sat inside the shelter with a fire in the pit and the rain hammering the forest outside and the water running past the doorways in rivulets and we were dry. For the first time in five days, nobody was wet or cold or sleeping on uneven ground.

The loggers had built this a hundred years ago. They'd cut timber, slept here, moved on. The shelter remained. Other people had come — their graffiti was on the walls, dates and initials, the oldest I could find reading 1947. People had been passing through these mountains and leaving temporary marks for a century, and the mountain absorbed them all and the shelter waited for the next ones.

We were the next ones. We wouldn't be the last.

Dale carved by firelight. The fox was finished. He'd started a turtle — the shell emerging in careful hexagonal plates. His hands were steadier. Not still — not yet — but the tremor was fading, the withdrawal's peak passing the way Dale had said it would: not all at once, but in increments, five minutes at a time.

"Recovery dreams," he said, quietly, turning the turtle in the firelight. "I dream about using. Every night. Not drugs — the knife. In the dream, the knife is the wrong shape. The blade curves where it shouldn't. And the wood won't hold a form — I carve and carve and the shavings fall and the shape underneath is always the same shapeless lump." He turned the turtle. The shell was precise. The real thing was more durable than the dream. "They don't stop. They just change what you're recovering from."

Maria put her hand on his knee. Deliberate, firm, the hand of a woman who had spent six years watching this man fight something invisible and had learned that the fight sometimes needed a physical anchor.

---

On Day 7 we encountered our first Turned on the trail.

Marcus spotted him first. A tree stand, twenty feet up in a white oak, fifty yards off the trail. The man was still in it — hunting camo, harness buckled, a compound bow across his lap. He'd been a hunter. He'd turned in the woods, probably in the first week, the fear catching up to him alone in his stand while the world below went wrong. He'd been sitting up there for weeks. The camo was filthy. His boots were still laced.

Marcus raised a fist — the stop signal — and we froze. Eight people on a narrow trail, packs on our backs, watching a Turned man in a tree stand watching us.

The head-turn was slow. The smile appeared. And then something I hadn't seen before: the hunter moved with purpose. Not the aimless drift, not the gravitational pull. He swung his legs off the platform and climbed down — hand under hand, the harness jerking against the tree as he descended, the compound bow falling from his lap and clattering through branches to the forest floor. His movements were fluid. Practiced. The muscle memory of a man who had climbed in and out of tree stands a thousand times, encoded so deep that even the organism couldn't erase it.

He hit the ground and stood. The smile was fixed. The head was tilted, tracking us the way it had tracked deer from the stand — that patient, predatory assessment, the hunter's calculation of distance and angle and approach. Then he began to move. Not toward us. Parallel. Through the trees, thirty yards off the trail, matching our pace, his boots silent on the leaf litter in a way that said he'd spent his whole life walking quietly in these woods.

"He's stalking us," I said.

Marcus nodded. "Hunting pattern. He's looking for the straggler."

The straggler was me. Or Ruth. Or Caleb. The weakest, the slowest, the one who fell behind. The organism had taken a man who knew how to hunt whitetail in these mountains and repurposed the skill. The patience, the positioning, the instinct for the vulnerable target — the hunter was hunting, and we were the herd.

We kept walking. He kept pace. Through the trees I caught glimpses — camo moving between trunks, the deliberate placement of feet, the tilted head tracking. He wasn't rushing. Hunters don't rush. They wait for the moment the prey separates, the instant the weak one lags, and then they close the distance.

"He's not going to stop," I said.

"No," Marcus said.

"If we keep walking, he follows. If Ruth falls behind, or Caleb — if anyone separates from the group for even a minute —"

"I know."

"We have to kill him."

The sentence came out and I heard it and the sound of it was flat and certain and the anger inside me said *yes.* Not the analytical assessment — the anger. The thing with edges that had been looking for a target since Clarksville. The hunter was a target. The hunter was the organism wearing a man's body and using a man's skills to stalk a seven-year-old boy, and the anger wanted him dead with a clarity that frightened me and also didn't frighten me enough.

Marcus looked at me. Something in my voice — the eagerness, maybe, the way I'd said "have to" when I meant "want to" — registered in his expression. A flicker of something. Not disapproval. Assessment. The look of a man calibrating whether the fifteen-year-old beside him was making a tactical decision or an emotional one.

"He's right," Sienna said, from behind us. Her voice was quiet. "He'll pick someone off. It's what they do when they're alone — they hunt. The collective ones herd. The solitary ones stalk." She'd been watching the Turned longer than anyone except me. She knew the behavioral modes. "If we don't deal with him now, we deal with him tonight. In the dark. When he has every advantage."

Marcus unslung the crossbow. None of us were experienced with it — Marcus had practiced in the church yard, hitting a target at twenty yards maybe six times out of ten, and a target that stood still in good light was not a man in camo moving through hickories at forty yards.

The hunter was circling — tightening the arc, closing toward the rear of the column where Ruth and Jim walked and Caleb rode on Dale's shoulders. Marcus stepped off the trail, found a shooting line between two oaks, raised the crossbow, and fired.

The bolt hit the hunter's shoulder. Not the chest — the shoulder, high, punching through the camo and spinning him sideways. He went down to one knee. And then the sound started.

I'd never heard a solitary Turned vocalize at full volume. In herds, the drone was collective — distributed, ambient, a sound that came from everywhere. This was one throat producing a sound that was not a scream and not a word and not anything a human larynx should have been able to sustain. A call. A signal, broadcasting to any collective within range: *here. Prey. Come.* The forest rang with it — birds erupted from the canopy, a squirrel bolted up the nearest oak, and the sound carried through the hollow like a siren.

"Again," I said. "Now."

Marcus was already reloading — fumbling the bolt into the rail, hands not quite steady, the cocking mechanism stiff. The hunter was back on his feet. The bolt in his shoulder didn't slow him — the Turned didn't process pain the way we did, the organism overriding the body's damage signals. He was moving toward us now. Not stalking. Charging. The patience was gone, replaced by the direct approach of a predator that had been wounded and was closing the distance before it could be wounded again.

Marcus fired. The second bolt hit the hunter's thigh. He stumbled, went down, got back up. The call was still going — that sustained, inhuman broadcast, and I was counting seconds in my head, calculating range, wondering how far the sound carried in these hollows and whether anything was close enough to hear and respond.

"There's nothing within range," Sienna said, reading my face. "We haven't seen Turned in two days. The nearest population center is twenty miles east."

She was probably right. The forest had been empty. But "probably" was not a word that kept people alive.

"Dale, take Caleb to the far side of the group," I said. "Ruth, Jim — stay behind Marcus. Sienna, with me."

I pulled the hatchet from my belt. The Atwoods hatchet — small, meant for splitting kindling, the handle wrapped in rubber grip tape. I'd been carrying it for seven days and hadn't used it for anything except chopping firewood. I walked toward the hunter.

He was on the ground, both bolts in him, dragging himself forward on his hands, the call still pouring from his throat. The camo was dark with blood. The tree stand harness trailed behind him, snagging on roots. His face was tilted up — the smile, always the smile — and his hands were reaching and the reaching was the hunting reflex, the grab, the instinct to close on prey that the organism had preserved and repurposed.

I hit him with the hatchet. Not cleanly — not the way Marcus handled tools, with precision and economy. I hit him in a way that was ugly and desperate and required a second swing and then a third, and the sound of it was the worst sound I had ever made, and his hand grabbed my ankle and the grip was strong — the grip of a man who had hauled deer out of ravines — and I hit him again and the grip released and he was still.

The call stopped. The forest was quiet. A bird — startled from its perch by the noise — returned to a branch overhead and sat there, watching.

I was breathing hard. My hands were shaking — not the grief shake, not the threshold shake. The exertion shake. The hatchet was in my right hand and my right hand was covered in — I'm not going to describe it. The journal should contain the truth but the truth has limits and this is one of them.

Sienna was beside me. She didn't touch me. She stood close enough that I could feel her presence and far enough that the closeness was a choice rather than an imposition, and she waited.

"Don't look," Dale was saying, somewhere behind us, his hand over Caleb's eyes, and Caleb was crying — not the sharp cry of a fall on the trail but the sustained, bewildered cry of a child who had heard sounds that children should not hear.

I looked down at the hunter. The camo. The harness. The compound bow, still lying where it had fallen from the tree stand. A man who had sat in a tree and waited for deer and who had been good at waiting and whose patience had survived the conversion and whose patience had almost been turned on a seven-year-old boy.

The hatchet in my hand. The blood. The body in the leaves. I hated it. The physical reality of killing — the sound, the resistance, the way a human body does not want to stop being a body — was nothing like the clean, analytical calculations I'd been making in the notebook. This was not math. This was meat and bone and the specific horror of doing violence with your hands rather than your mind.

And underneath the horror — the thing I need to record because the journal should contain the truth — satisfaction. Small, cold, precise. The organism had lost one body. One set of hunting skills it couldn't repurpose. One threat that would never circle back to Caleb in the dark. The satisfaction and the horror occupied the same space and neither one displaced the other and I held them both the way you hold two things that don't fit together and can't be put down.

Jim prayed. He knelt in the leaves beside the body and put his hand on the man's shoulder and prayed for a hunter who had died twice — once when the organism took him, once when a fifteen-year-old with a hatchet finished what a crossbow had started — and the prayer was for both deaths, and Jim's face when he stood up was the face of a man who was keeping a tab that was getting longer.

Then we waited.

Nobody said it. Nobody had to. The call had gone out — that sustained, inhuman broadcast — and the call had carried through the hollow for God knows how far, and if anything was in range, anything at all, it would be coming. Marcus held the crossbow loaded, scanning the tree line. Sienna stood at the edge of the trail, listening. I stood with the hatchet still in my hand because I hadn't figured out yet how to put it down.

Five minutes. The forest was quiet. Wind in the canopy. A creek somewhere below us, the sound of water over rock. Nothing else. No drone. No footsteps in the leaves. No head-turns through the trees. Sienna had been right — the nearest population center was twenty miles east, and the trail had been empty for days. The call had gone out and nothing had answered.

"Clear," Marcus said, after ten minutes. He lowered the crossbow. The word was a truck driver's word — the all-clear after checking mirrors, after verifying the lane was open. Professional. Final.

Marcus cleaned the crossbow bolts. He didn't look at me while he did it. Dale held Caleb and murmured the nothing-words that hold children together. Maria checked Ruth's pulse — routine, automatic, the nurse's instinct that kept running even when the world had stopped. I cleaned the hatchet on the leaves and put it back on my belt and my hand didn't want to let go of it and I made it let go.

I picked up the compound bow. It was where it had fallen from the tree stand — scuffed, the cam wheels caked with dirt, the string still taut. The quiver was on the platform above, and I climbed up to get it. Six broadhead arrows. The tree stand smelled like weeks of occupation — the specific, animal smell of a body that had sat in one place through rain and sun and the slow erasure of everything that had made it human. I slung the bow across my pack and clipped the quiver to the frame. Another weapon. Another weight. The pack dug harder into my shoulders and the extra pounds were a different kind of carrying — not gear, not food, not the logistical weight Maria had calculated and distributed. This was the weight of what I'd taken from the body on the ground, and I carried it the way I carried everything now: silently, without asking whether I should.

We walked on. Behind us, the hunter lay in a wash of late-afternoon light — the golden hour, the sun low enough to turn the oak canopy into stained glass, bronze and amber, the light falling in shafts through the thinning leaves and landing on the forest floor in warm pools. A breeze came through the hollow, cool and gentle, carrying the smell of dead leaves and cedar and the faint mineral sweetness of the creek below. A cardinal landed on a branch ten feet from the body. It sang — two notes, a pause, two notes — the territorial call, bright and clean and utterly indifferent. The forest was doing the thing it had always done: being beautiful. The golden light on the hillside. The birdsong. The cool November air that tasted like nothing had ever gone wrong. And on the ground beneath it, in the same light, the body — camo dark and wet, the hatchet marks visible, the tree stand empty above him like a pulpit nobody would use again. The beauty did not pause for what we'd done. The violence did not diminish the beauty. The two things existed in the same frame and the frame held them without comment, the way these mountains had held a century of logging and hunting and living and dying without ever changing their expression. I turned away. The image stayed — the cardinal singing over the body in the golden light, the blood splatterd on the fall leaves... and it would stay for a long time.

I walked and I thought about what I had done with my hands and what I had felt while I did it and I knew — with the clarity that the trail provided on the long, flat ridgeline stretches where the mind had nothing to do but think — that this was not what I wanted to become. The satisfaction was real. The hatred was real. The anger that had fueled me since Clarksville was real and useful and it had kept me on the trail and it had put the hatchet in my hand and it had made the swings possible. But there was a line. Somewhere between the necessity of what we'd done and the satisfaction I'd felt doing it, there was a line, and I needed to find it, because on one side of that line was a person who killed because he had to and on the other side was a person who killed because it felt like the world owed him violence, and those two people were standing very close together and I could not tell which one was holding the hatchet.

The mountains don't care what happens on their surface. That's not cruelty. That's patience. I needed some of that patience for myself.

---

The oaks were bronze and amber, the last of the fall color hanging on in the sheltered hollows where the frost hadn't reached. The hickories were bare — silver branches against blue sky, the kind of clean, geometric beauty that made you understand why people painted trees. The air was cold and clear and tasted like nothing — no exhaust, no generator fumes, no smoke from burning houses. Just air. The kind of air that had been here before people and would be here after.

On the ridgelines, the views opened up and the world was enormous. Layer after layer of blue ridges extending to the horizon, each one lighter than the last, the farthest ones almost indistinguishable from sky. It looked like a place where nothing bad had ever happened and nothing bad ever would, which was a lie, but it was a beautiful lie, and the beauty was not diminished by its dishonesty.

The cool weather was pleasant when it wasn't raining. On clear days, the walking was almost — I'm going to use the word — enjoyable. The rhythm of it. The breathing. The way the mind went blank on the long stretches, the flat ridgeline sections where the trail was easy and the pack was manageable and you could just walk and think about nothing. The nothing-thinking was a mercy. After weeks of hypervigilance — tracking Turned, monitoring heart rates, calculating thresholds — the absence of threat allowed the brain to idle, and the idling was rest, and the rest was necessary.

On the afternoon after the hunter, I caught Sienna looking at me. Not the assessing look — not the one she used when she was calibrating whether to push or to wait. Something else. She was walking ahead, in her usual position behind Marcus, and she glanced back over her shoulder and the expression on her face was one I hadn't seen before. Concern — yes, the same concern she'd been showing since the church, the gentle version, the water-at-the-creek-crossing version. But underneath the concern, or beside it, something that looked like fear. Not fear of the trail or the Turned or the distance ahead. Fear of me.

She'd watched me call for the hunter's death. She'd watched me walk toward him with the hatchet. She'd watched me swing it — not once, not cleanly, but the ugly repeated work of someone who didn't know how to kill efficiently and did it anyway. And she'd watched me afterward — the way I'd stood over the body and hadn't looked away, the way I'd climbed the tree stand and taken his bow, the way I'd cleaned the hatchet and put it back on my belt with hands that were steady when they shouldn't have been.

She was trying to reconcile two people. The boy from the trailer park — the one who sat at a window and wrote in a notebook, the one who got winded on stairs and made self-deprecating jokes, the one who'd laughed in the church yard and matched her pace and let her lean against his shoulder under the stars. And the boy on the trail — the one who'd said "we have to kill him" with an eagerness that didn't belong in a fifteen-year-old's voice, the one who was carrying a dead man's bow on his pack and walking faster because of it.

She turned forward without saying anything. The distance between us on the trail was thirty yards and the distance between us in every other way was something I couldn't measure and didn't know how to close.

Conversations happened on the downhill, when breathing was easier. Marcus told stories about hauling loads through these mountains — the grades that killed transmissions, the ice storms that turned the passes into skating rinks, the time he jackknifed a trailer on a switchback and had to wait six hours for a tow truck that never came. Ruth corrected everyone's grammar. Caleb asked questions about everything — why trees lost their leaves, why the creek water was brown, why rocks had stripes — and Jim answered each one with the patient, slightly inaccurate explanations of a man who cared more about engaging curiosity than being correct.

The pace built. Three miles the first day. Four on the second. By Day 7 we were making five, sometimes six, the bodies adapting the way Marcus had promised, the legs finding their strength, the lungs expanding, the rhythm settling into something sustainable. Even Ruth moved faster — not by much, but measurably, her walking stick planted with more confidence, her steps surer on the rocks.

I lost weight. Not dramatically — maybe five pounds, maybe eight — but enough that my pants were looser and the pack felt lighter and the uphills were incrementally less catastrophic. The chafing faded as the jeans broke in and my thighs toughened. The shoulder bruises hardened into something that hurt less. The body was adapting. The body I'd been apologizing for was doing the thing I needed it to do, and the doing was changing it, and the changing was its own kind of answer to the question Sienna had asked in the church parking lot.

In the mornings, everyone was stiff and sore. This faded within a mile. But on the long stretches, the mind went blank — or thought about food. You zone out. You walk and walk and the trail is the same and the trees are the same and your feet find their own way and you think about dinner, about the freeze-dried packet waiting at the end of the day, about how many bites you'll take and how slowly you'll eat them to make the meal last, and the thinking about food is its own kind of sustenance, a mental rehearsal that your stomach treats as a promissory note.

By Day 8, Dale's hands were steady. Not still — not completely — but the tremor had faded to something you'd only notice if you were looking for it, and I was always looking. The worst had passed. The sweating had stopped. The cramping had eased. His heart rate was down to 82 — still elevated, but manageable, safe. He carved the turtle with clean, controlled strokes, the hexagonal plates of the shell emerging with the precision his hands hadn't been capable of three days earlier.

"How long?" I asked. Meaning: how long have your hands been still.

Dale looked at his hands. Turned them over. Studied them the way you'd study a landscape you'd been traveling through and only now recognized.

"Two days," he said. "Maybe three." He held up the knife. "The trail helped. Keeping the hands busy. Keeping the body moving. It's the same thing my counselor taught me in year one: don't think about the craving. Think about the next five minutes. Do something with your hands. The craving passes. The five minutes become ten. The ten become an hour. The hour becomes a day you didn't use."

In the morning the world was slightly less wrong than it had been the night before.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #14:**

*Day 32. Eight days on the trail. Fifty-something miles behind us, and I've stopped counting because counting the miles is another version of the laziness — another way to measure how much suffering remains instead of accepting that the suffering is the method and the method is working.*

*Dale's hands are steady. The withdrawal peaked around Day 4 and broke. He taught us HALT. He taught us urge surfing. He told us rock bottom was just training. The worst thing that happened to Dale gave him the exact skills this world requires. Wrong reasons. Right answers. The pattern holds.*

*The forest is beautiful. I want that recorded because the journal has been a catalog of horrors and the forest deserves better. The oaks are bronze. The ridgelines are blue. The air tastes like nothing and nothing is the best thing I've tasted in a month.*

*A Turned hunter stalked us through the forest. Tree stand, camo, compound bow — he'd turned weeks ago and the hunting instincts survived the conversion intact. He was circling toward the rear of the column. Toward Ruth. Toward Caleb. Marcus shot him twice with the crossbow. It wasn't enough. I finished it with the hatchet.*

*I am not going to describe what that was like. The notebook has been a record of data and observations and the hatchet is not data. The hatchet is the sound and the feel and the way a body resists what you're doing to it and the way you do it anyway.*

*I told Marcus we had to kill him. I was right. The tactical assessment was sound — a solitary stalker, hunting skills intact, targeting our weakest. The group was at risk. The decision was correct. But I wanted it. When I said "we have to kill him," the emphasis in my head was on "kill," not "have to." The anger wanted a target it could reach and the hunter was the first one.*

*I hated it and it felt satisfying and both of those are true at the same time and the both-at-the-same-time is the thing I need to figure out because there is a line. Somewhere between the necessity and the satisfaction there is a line and I am standing on it and I don't know which side I'm facing. On one side: a person who does what has to be done. On the other: a person who wants to do it. I need to find that line. I need to know where it is. Because the person on the wrong side of it is not someone my mother would recognize, and she's already lost enough without losing me too.*

*Jim prayed for him. Jim always prays for them. Jim is the line. Jim is the person who does the necessary thing and carries the cost without letting the cost change what he carries it with. I am not Jim. But I need to learn what Jim knows, or the thing with edges will become the only thing I am.*

*I carry my mother in the sealed part of my brain. The envelope is open but the contents are not what I expected. I expected grief. I got grief and something else — something that paces where the grief sits still. The grief is a woman in blue scrubs. The other thing is what happened to the woman in blue scrubs, and what I want to do about it, and the wanting is not clinical and is not analytical and does not belong in a notebook that has been, until now, a record of data and patterns. The trail is not the place for this. But the trail is where I use it. Every uphill. Every switchback. The thing with edges makes the pack lighter and I am not going to examine that too closely because I need it to work and examination might break it.*

*Sienna knows something is wrong. She brings me water. She walks beside me on the downhills. She touches my arm on the steep sections. She is trying to reach me the way you try to reach someone on the other side of a window and she doesn't know the window is there and I don't know how to tell her.*

*We walk.*

# Chapter 21: The Overpass

Lake Fort Smith was a man-made lake at the bottom of the mountains — a dam, a spillway, a campground with bathrooms that still smelled like bleach and pine, and a gas station at the highway junction that had been looted for food but not for shopping carts. We took four. The wheels were stiff from sitting in the rain but they rolled, and rolling was the point: sixty miles of trail with packs on our backs had taught us the value of not carrying weight when you didn't have to.

The transition happened in an afternoon. We walked out of the forest and onto pavement and the difference was immediate — the shock of flat ground after two weeks of roots and rocks, the strange smoothness of asphalt under shoes that had molded to uneven terrain. Highway 71 stretched south toward Fayetteville, the old Pig Trail, two lanes of cracked blacktop winding through the mountains. It had been mostly abandoned since Highway 49 was built — the newer, wider road that bypassed the switchbacks and the small towns and the tourist traps that had once sold Ozark pottery and homemade fudge and wooden signs that said BLESS THIS MESS. The Pig Trail was a relic. Now it was our road.

Shopping carts on asphalt. The sound was absurd — that rattling, clattering grocery-store sound echoing off the mountain walls, announcing our presence to every Turned within a quarter mile. But the trade-off was worth it: packs in the carts, bodies upright, shoulders and hips finally unburdened after days of grinding. Ruth sat in her cart when her knees gave out, Maria pushing her, the two of them looking like the world's most unlikely grocery run.

The Turned were more numerous here. Closer to population centers, closer to the small towns strung along the highway like beads on a wire. We saw them in gas station parking lots, in the doorways of shuttered restaurants, wandering the center line of the highway in that aimless, gravitational drift. Mostly singles and pairs. We gave them wide berth, pushing the carts onto the shoulder, into the gravel, waiting for them to pass. The highway was exposed — no tree cover, no ridgelines to hide behind — but it was fast. Seven miles the first day. Eight the second. The flat ground and the cart wheels were doing what the trail couldn't.

On Day 37 I killed thirty people and I need to tell you about it in the way it actually happened, which is quietly, from a hillside, by doing math.

Highway 71 wound through a series of cuts and fills where the road had been carved through the ridgelines — blasted rock faces on either side, the old dynamite marks still visible in the limestone. At one of these cuts, a county road crossed over the highway on an overpass — a concrete span built in the 1970s, the kind of infrastructure that had been on a deferred maintenance list for twenty years. The concrete was crumbling at the expansion joints. The guardrails were rusted. On the upper deck, two semi-trucks had been abandoned — one a flatbed hauling lumber, the other a fuel tanker, its cylindrical tank catching the late-morning sun.

Under the overpass, in the shadow of the concrete span, a cluster of Turned had gathered. Twenty-five. Maybe thirty. Standing in the dim space where the highway passed under the bridge, milling in slow circuits, drawn to the infrastructure the way they were drawn to all human-built things — the echoes, the geometry, the residual smell of diesel and asphalt and a thousand cars that had passed through before the world stopped. The terrain funneled them: the highway rose on embankments to meet the overpass, creating a bowl beneath the span where the Turned collected like water in a drain.

I studied it from the hillside for an hour. Through the binoculars I could see the supports — four concrete columns, each maybe three feet in diameter, cracked where the rebar was corroding, where decades of freeze-thaw cycles had worked the concrete apart. The deck above was loaded: the two semis plus the weight of the road surface plus whatever water and debris had accumulated on the asphalt. The supports were holding all of it, barely, the way an old man holds a heavy door — upright, functional, but not by much.

The alternative was backtracking — north a mile, then east on a forest service road to bypass the cut, then south on a parallel road to rejoin the highway below the overpass. But the forest service road was unpaved, rutted, impossible with shopping carts. We'd have to carry the packs again. And the detour added half a day of exposed walking through open terrain where we'd already seen Turned drifting in from the surrounding towns. Ruth's atenolol supply was at four days. Four days of medication between her and a heart rate that would light up the organism like a signal flare.

I looked at the overpass. I looked at the supports. I looked at the Turned clustered under the span.

The idea arrived the way ideas arrive — complete, already too detailed to be unnamed. It was the thought I'd had watching the Lyles' house come apart, the one I'd written in the private journal and hadn't shown anyone. The roof section that took out six of them. The way they didn't dodge. The way the frenzy made them destroy everything in reach including each other. The quarry off Route 7.

I should say I didn't want it. That's what the journal should record — the reluctance, the moral weight, the boy who didn't want to become the kind of person who engineers a collapse on top of thirty human beings. And that boy existed. He was in there somewhere, behind the anger, behind the weeks of trail and the parking lot and the smile.

But the truth is more complicated than the boy.

Part of me had been waiting for this. The anger — the thing with edges that I'd carried since Clarksville, that had fueled every uphill, that had turned physical pain into something I used instead of something I endured — the anger had been looking for a target it could actually reach. Not the organism, which was everywhere and nowhere. Not the Turned in the hospital parking lot, who were beyond punishment. Not myself, whose self-inflicted suffering on the trail was satisfying but ultimately impotent. The anger wanted something it could *do.* An action. A consequence. A way to punish the thing that had taken my mother, even if the punishment landed on the bodies the thing was wearing.

The overpass was the first opportunity I'd had to hurt it.

The analytical brain provided the method — the compromised supports, the loaded deck, the frenzy mechanics. The analysis was sound. The math checked. But the eagerness was new. The eagerness was not the analytical brain. The eagerness was the thing with edges, and the eagerness said: *yes. Finally. Make it hurt.*

I want it recorded that this frightened me. The math and the rage arriving at the same answer and the impossibility of knowing which one I was listening to. The door opened and I didn't know if I was opening it out of necessity or desire, and the not-knowing was the most honest thing I'd felt in weeks.

---

I proposed it to the group at the hillside. Not dramatically. In the flat, analytical voice that was my default when the thing I was saying was too large for inflection.

"We set up a noise source — the hand-crank radio, or just banging on metal — about a hundred yards north of the overpass. It draws them out, concentrates them. When the count is high enough, the density tips them into frenzy. When they frenzy near the supports, they'll attack the structure. The supports are failing already. The load on the deck — the trucks, the tanker — it's too much for compromised columns. The overpass comes down. The trucks come down with it. We wait at distance. When it's over, we walk through."

Silence. The particular silence of people processing something they weren't prepared to hear.

Jim spoke first. "Those are people, Nate."

"They were people." The sentence came out and I heard it and the sound of it was the sound of a line being crossed. Not the words — the tone. The detachment. The way I said "were" without flinching. I wanted to flinch. I couldn't afford to.

"They're still people," Jim said. "Somewhere in there, they're still —"

"Jim, I know. I know they have memories. I know the organism uses those memories. I know that somewhere inside each of them is a person who had a name and a family and a life. I know all of this. And I also know that between us and Fayetteville are thirty of them blocking the highway, and Ruth has four days of atenolol, and we can't carry the packs on an unpaved detour, and we don't have half a day to go around."

"There's always another way."

"There isn't always another way. Sometimes the other way is worse and the only honest thing to do is say so."

The argument expanded. Sienna opposed it — not on Jim's grounds, not theology. Instinct. "It feels wrong. It feels like — Nate, you're talking about engineering a mass casualty event. You're talking about setting a trap."

"I'm talking about using the frenzy's own destructive behavior against a compromised structure in a controlled context. The frenzy happens without us — it's happened at the Lyles', at the ranch house, at every concentration point I've observed. We're not creating a new threat. We're directing an existing one."

"That's a rationalization."

"Maybe. But it's also true."

Marcus, from his position at the edge of the group: "The detour adds half a day. Half a day carrying packs on unpaved roads with no cover. Ruth can't do it — not with three days of medication left."

Dale spoke. He was holding the fox carving — finished now, the detail work clean, the strokes precise with steady hands. "When I was using," he said, "my counselor told me that recovery means choosing the hard thing that works over the easy thing that feels right. This is the hard thing."

The group looked at him. Dale — weeks past withdrawal, hands steady, standing straighter than he had since Clarksville — had reframed the moral question with the vocabulary of a man who'd spent a decade learning to distinguish between what felt right and what was right. In recovery, the thing that feels right is the relapse. The comfortable choice. The one your brain screams for. The hard thing — the meeting, the check-in, the daily grind of choosing not to use — is the thing that works.

"This is the meeting," Dale said. "This is the part where you sit in the folding chair and you don't want to be there and you do the thing anyway because the alternative is worse."

Jim looked at Dale. Something passed between them — the pastor and the addict, two men who had spent their lives in folding chairs in basements, arriving at the same place from opposite directions.

"I won't be part of it," Jim said. Not angry. Quiet. Certain. "I'll stay back with Ruth and Caleb. I'll pray."

"For us?" I asked.

"For them." He meant the Turned. He meant the thirty people under the overpass who were about to die because a fifteen-year-old with a notebook had done the math. "You do what you need to do, Nate. I'll do what I need to do. And if we're both right, God can sort out the difference."

Marcus and Sienna set up the noise source. The hand-crank radio, tuned to static, volume maxed, jammed into the passenger seat of a wrecked car on the highway shoulder a hundred yards north of the overpass. The static carried — that white-noise hiss, audible for a quarter mile in the silence. I could hear it from the hillside where Dale and I were positioned, two hundred yards south, above the interchange, looking down through the binoculars.

The Turned responded. The cluster under the overpass began drifting north — slowly, drawn by the sound, the collective orientation shifting like a compass needle. More came from the east, from the fields beyond the highway. More from a house I hadn't spotted, emerging from a garage in single file. The count climbed: twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. They converged on the area between the overpass and the noise source, milling, tightening, the density compressing as more arrived.

Marcus and Sienna withdrew — south along the highway shoulder, moving fast but not running, back to the hillside where Jim and Ruth and Maria and Caleb were waiting. I watched them through the binoculars. They were clear. The Turned were focused on the noise, not on the retreating figures.

I counted. Thirty-five. Forty. The cluster was directly under the overpass now, the density at its highest where the embankments funneled them into the bowl beneath the span. The behavior was changing — the twitchiness I'd first observed at the Lyles', the restless, jerky movements, the heads snapping toward nothing. The droning started. Low, resonant, building.

Dale was beside me. His hands were steady — had been for days now, the withdrawal broken somewhere on the trail behind us — but his breathing was measured, the recovery breathing, the slow counts he'd been practicing for twelve years. He was watching the Turned below and his face was the face of a man who understood craving in all its forms and was choosing, again, the hard thing.

"It's happening," I said. Meaning the threshold.

"I see it," he said.

The shudder. The phase transition. One moment they were milling, individual, restless. The next they were a single thing — a collective body, convulsing, the coordinated patience of the herd snapping into the undirected violence of the frenzy. The sound changed: not the drone but a roar, multi-throated, the sound of forty human vocal cords producing something that was not a human sound.

They hit the overpass supports. Not because they were aiming — because the supports were what was there. The nearest column took the first impact: bodies, dozens of them, pressing and pushing and tearing with the mechanical fury of the frenzy. Concrete cracked. I could hear it from two hundred yards — a sharp report, like a gunshot, as the rebar inside the column sheared. The column held. Then the second wave hit, and the column didn't hold.

The deck shifted. Two inches, then six, then a foot — the road surface tilting as the column gave way, the weight of the semis sliding toward the low side. The fuel tanker rolled first — slowly, massively, the cylinder turning on its axis, picking up speed as the deck tilted further. It went over the edge.

The impact was unlike anything I have a comparison for. Ten thousand gallons of diesel fuel in a steel cylinder falling twenty feet onto concrete and bodies. The tanker ruptured on impact — not an explosion, not at first, just a splitting of steel and a wave of fuel that spread across the highway in a dark sheet. Then the lumber truck followed, sliding off the collapsing deck, the flatbed hitting the road surface and shattering into a spray of pine two-by-fours and steel. Then the deck itself — the concrete span, crumbling at the compromised joints, falling in sections, each section a multi-ton slab of reinforced concrete dropping into the space where the Turned were frenzying.

The fuel ignited. I don't know what sparked it — friction, electrical, the impact of steel on concrete. The diesel went up in a rolling flame that I felt on my face from two hundred yards, a wave of heat that smelled like every truck stop Marcus had ever hated.

Dust. Fire. The sound of structural collapse — a grinding, crumbling, continuous sound that lasted maybe thirty seconds and then subsided into the crackle of burning diesel and the settling of rubble. The overpass was gone. The highway was buried under a mound of concrete, steel, lumber, and fire. The Turned who had been underneath were — I didn't look through the binoculars. I didn't need to. The physics were clear.

Some survived. They always did. I could see them at the edges — stumbling out of the dust and debris, broken, confused, the frenzy spent. A man with one arm hanging wrong, wandering into the field. A woman, face bloodied, sitting on the highway shoulder the way you'd sit after a car accident, dazed, absent. They'd disperse. The post-frenzy scatter. In an hour the highway would be empty except for the rubble and the smoke.

Dale's hand was on my shoulder. I hadn't noticed him put it there. The grip was firm — steady, grounding, the hand of a man who'd already survived his own collapse and was now anchoring someone else through theirs.

"Breathe," he said.

I breathed. I realized I'd been holding my breath since the deck shifted. How long? A minute? Two?

"It's done," he said.

"It's done."

The group walked through at dusk. The fire had burned itself out. The rubble was still warm underfoot — I could feel it through my shoes, the residual heat of diesel and concrete.

Nobody spoke.

I stepped over a hand protruding from the rubble. I saw it — the hand, the fingers, the wrist. I did not look at it and I did not look away from it. I looked at it the way I looked at everything: directly, completely, recording. The hand was female. The nails had dirt under them. There was a ring — a gold band, a wedding ring. Someone's wife. Someone's mother. Someone who had been a person before the organism made her part of a collective, and who was now buried under the ruins of an overpass because a fifteen-year-old had done the math and the math had said this was the optimal outcome.

Caleb was on Marcus's back, face buried in Marcus's shoulder. Marcus was talking to him — a low, steady murmur about nothing, about truck stops, about what kind of ice cream was best, keeping the boy's world small and warm while the real world burned and crumbled under their feet.

Jim walked last. He walked through the rubble with his head bowed and his lips moving and he was praying — for the dead, for the Turned, for the people who had been people before they were debris. I watched him and I understood that Jim's prayer and my math had arrived at the same event from different directions, and that the event was the same regardless of which road you took to get there, and that the difference between us was not in the outcome but in what we carried afterward.

Jim would carry the prayer. I would carry the hand.

That night, camped in a pulloff a mile south of the wreckage, I wrote by flashlight because the fire we built was too far from where I was sitting and I was sitting apart because I didn't want to be near people and I didn't want to be alone and both of these things were true at the same time.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #15:**

*We killed approximately thirty people today. I say "approximately" because I couldn't get an accurate count. I say "people" because I don't know what else to call them. I say "we" because it was my idea.*

*Jim wouldn't look at me during dinner. Sienna looked at me too much. Marcus gave me a cup of water and said "drink this" the way you talk to someone in shock, and I think maybe I am.*

*Here is what I know: we are all alive, including Caleb, including Ruth, and we are one day closer to the university.*

*Here is what I don't know: whether that math justifies what we did.*

*Here is what I'm afraid of: that I'll get used to it.*

*Here is what I'm more afraid of: that I need to.*

*Here is what I can't write and am writing anyway: part of me wanted it. Not the math — the math is neutral, the math doesn't want. The other thing. The thing with edges that I've been carrying since Clarksville. It wanted the overpass. It wanted the supports to crack and the deck to fall and the organism to feel, for once, what it felt like to be on the receiving end. The math provided the justification. The anger provided the willingness. And I don't know which one made the decision because they arrived at the same answer at the same time and the answer was: do it.*

*I told Jim "they were people" and heard the detachment in my own voice and the detachment was real but it was also a performance — the analytical boy performing analysis while the angry boy watched the columns crack and felt something that was not horror.*

*Dale sat with me for an hour after dinner. He didn't say anything. He carved the fox. His hands were steady — the withdrawal broken days ago on the trail — and the fox was beautiful and I thought about how the damage and the craft come from the same place and you don't get one without the other. Dale's hands had shaken for days and now they didn't and the fox was proof that the other side of suffering is precision.*

*Tomorrow we walk. The highway stretches south toward Fayetteville — twenty miles, maybe twenty-five. More Turned as we get closer to the city. More decisions. I'll have a plan because that's what I do now. I make plans that involve other people dying so that my people can live, and I write them in a notebook and I execute them from a safe distance and I carry the results in my chest like stones and the stones are getting heavier and I'm fifteen and I don't know how many more I can carry before the weight of them changes me into something I don't recognize.*

*Sienna asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said "Liar." She was right. She's always right about the things I don't say.*

The next day we found the town.

It wasn't much — a bend in the highway where a gas station, a general store, and a barbecue restaurant clustered around an intersection like survivors huddling for warmth. The kind of place that had survived on Pig Trail tourists: bikers on weekend rides, families stopping for pulled pork and sweet tea, college kids from Fayetteville driving up to see the fall leaves. A sign out front of the restaurant said WORLD FAMOUS SMOKED RIBS and the world that had made them famous was gone.

Someone had fortified the gas station. Plywood over the windows, reinforced with sheet metal from the restaurant's roof. A pickup truck parked sideways across the entrance, blocking the lot. Barbed wire — actual barbed wire, probably from a farm supply — strung between the gas pumps. And on the roof, behind a low wall of sandbags, a man with a deer rifle watching us approach.

"That's far enough," he called. We were fifty yards out. The shopping carts rattled to a stop.

Marcus raised both hands. "We're passing through. Heading south."

"Nobody passes through. You go around."

"There's no around. The highway is the road."

A pause. The man on the roof consulted someone below — I could hear voices, muffled, the acoustics of people arguing inside a metal-and-plywood box. Then a woman emerged from behind the truck barricade. Mid-forties, sunburned, a shotgun held at port arms with the casual competence of someone who'd grown up with guns.

"How many?" she asked.

"Eight. One child, one elderly."

She looked at us — really looked, the way you assess livestock or weather. Counting heads, reading posture, calculating threat. Her eyes lingered on Marcus's crossbow, on the hatchets at Dale's and Sienna's hips.

"You're armed."

"Lightly. We're not looking for trouble."

"Nobody's looking for trouble. Trouble shows up anyway." She lowered the shotgun half an inch. "What do you have to trade?"

This was Marcus's territory — the negotiation, the reading of a room. He stepped forward, slow, hands visible. "Medication. Blood pressure meds, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories. Some painkillers — prescription, from a pharmacy."

Interest flickered across her face. Medication was currency now — more valuable than food, more valuable than ammunition, because you couldn't grow it or reload it or find it in the woods. When the pharmacies were empty, the medication was gone.

"What do you want?"

"Food. Canned goods, dried meat, whatever you can spare. We're three days from Fayetteville."

They let us approach. Not inside — we traded through the barricade, items passed over the hood of the pickup truck. Maria handled the inventory, counting pills, portioning carefully, keeping enough of Ruth's atenolol for the remaining days while trading the surplus antibiotics and ibuprofen she'd stockpiled from the church's first-aid supplies. In exchange: twelve cans of beans, a bag of rice, a sleeve of beef jerky, and a gallon jug of water.

There were nine of them inside the gas station. I could see them through the gap in the plywood — faces in the dim interior, watching us the way the Turned watched from a distance, with that guarded, calculating patience. A teenager, roughly my age, stared at me from behind the counter. He had the look — the hollowed-out, too-old look that I recognized because I saw it in every reflective surface. We were the same age and we were both ancient.

I recognized the pattern. The Lyles' house. The fortified position, the barricade, the perimeter defense. The belief that if you built the walls high enough, the world would stay outside.

"How long have you been here?" I asked the woman.

"Since the beginning. Three weeks."

"How many were you when you started?"

She didn't answer, which was its own answer. More than nine. Maybe fifteen, maybe twenty. The attrition of a static position — the Turned pressing in, the supplies dwindling, the perimeter shrinking.

"You should move," I said. The words came out before the social calculus could stop them. "South. Fayetteville. We've heard there's a research group at the university — someone working on the frequency."

"We've heard a lot of things."

"The static defense doesn't hold. I've seen it. The Turned concentrate around fixed positions — the noise, the lights, the human smell. The longer you stay, the more of them gather. The density builds until it tips into frenzy and the frenzy destroys whatever you've built."

The woman looked at me. The way adults look at children who say things children shouldn't know. "How old are you?"

"Fifteen."

"And you're an expert on survival strategy."

"I'm an expert on what I've observed. And I've observed that everyone who fortifies dies. Everyone who moves survives. The math isn't complicated."

She didn't respond. Behind her, through the gap in the plywood, the teenager was still watching me. He'd heard. Whether he believed was a different question.

We left. Shopping carts loaded with the traded food, wheels rattling on the asphalt, the gas station shrinking behind us. Marcus walked beside me.

"You tried," he said.

"They won't move."

"No."

"They'll die there."

"Probably." Marcus adjusted the crossbow on his shoulder. "You can't save people who don't want to be saved. That's not a failure. That's a boundary."

I looked back once. The man on the roof was watching us go. The rifle was still in his hands. The barbed wire glinted in the afternoon sun. Nine people in a gas station, waiting for the world to come to them.

The world would come.
