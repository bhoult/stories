# Chapter 19: The First Mile

The Ozark Highlands Trail does not believe in flat.

We rode bicycles to the trailhead. Eight people on eight bikes, pedaling twenty miles of two-lane blacktop through the Ozark foothills, packs strapped to rear racks and handlebars and, in my case, balanced on my lap like a pregnant belly made of nylon and poor decisions. Ruth and Jim had the e-bikes — Ruth because her knees couldn't pedal twenty miles, Jim because he was seventy-three and nobody argued with Ruth about getting one so nobody could argue with Jim either. Caleb rode on Marcus's handlebars, gripping the crossbar with both hands, the wooden beagle in his jacket pocket bumping against the frame.

The road was empty. Three weeks of no traffic and the pavement was already changing — leaves in the gutters, a branch down in the right lane, the first cracks where tree roots were starting to reclaim what asphalt had borrowed. We passed houses. Some had Turned in the yards — the head-turns tracked us as we pedaled past, the smiles following, but bikes were fast enough that none of them transitioned beyond passive interest. We passed Clarksville's city limit sign and the Dollar General and the shuttered Sonic Drive-In and the world we were leaving behind.

We reached the trailhead at midday — a gravel parking area off Forest Service Road 1003. The parking area was empty. No cars, no Turned. The first good sign in three weeks.

We leaned the bikes against a split-rail fence at the edge of the lot. Eight bicycles, two of them still showing a charge on their battery indicators. Machines we'd never use again. Marcus looked at them for a moment — the particular look of a man who'd spent his life around vehicles, who understood the value of anything with wheels — and then turned away. We were leaving the world of wheels. Everything after this was feet.

The trailhead marker was a brown post with a white blaze — an aluminum diamond nailed to the wood, catching the November light. Beyond it, the trail entered the forest like a thread being pulled into fabric: a two-foot-wide path of packed earth and leaf litter, climbing immediately, switchbacking up a hardwood hollow toward a sandstone ridge that was invisible from below.

"That's up," Caleb said. He was holding Dale's hand. Dale had given him the beagle to carry in his jacket pocket and Caleb had his other hand on the beagle and he was looking at the trail the way a seven-year-old looks at something that is clearly, obviously, unfairly tall.

"That's up," Marcus confirmed.

"All of it?"

"Most of it."

Caleb looked at me. I don't know why he looked at me — maybe because I was the biggest person who also clearly didn't want to walk uphill, and solidarity with the reluctant is comforting at any age.

"I don't want to," he said.

"Me neither, buddy. Let's go."

---

The first mile climbed six hundred feet. I know this because Marcus told me, and I know Marcus told me because I asked, and I asked because I am the kind of person who wants to quantify suffering, as if knowing the exact gradient of the switchback will make my lungs burn less. It does not.

Oak leaves covered the trail — ankle-deep, dry, hiding every root and rock beneath them. The path switchbacked up the hollow in tight turns, gaining elevation through a forest of white oaks and hickories that were shedding their canopy in sheets of bronze and amber. The leaves crunched under eight pairs of feet. Below us, through the thinning trees, the lowland we'd left fell away into haze.

The order of march: Marcus in front, because he'd crossed these ridgelines by road and had the best instinct for terrain. Then Sienna, setting pace, her stride shortened to match Ruth's but still fluid, still the athlete's economy. Then Jim and Ruth, side by side, Jim's hand occasionally steadying Ruth's elbow on the steeper grades. Then Dale and Caleb, Dale's knife out and a piece of wood in his other hand, carving as he walked, the shavings falling behind him like breadcrumbs. Then Maria, who walked with the precise, metronomic pace of a woman who had decided that sixty miles was a logistical problem and was solving it one step at a time.

Then me.

I was last because I was slowest. This was not a strategic decision. It was physics. A hundred and eighty pounds going uphill on legs that had never climbed anything steeper than the stairs to the school library, with thirty-two pounds of pack shifting on my back like a drunk passenger. The hip belt dug into the tops of my hip bones — a grinding pressure that started as discomfort and became pain within the first half mile. The shoulder straps pulled backward, hauling at my collarbones, making me lean forward on the uphills until my center of gravity was somewhere in front of my knees and every step felt like catching a fall. My back was soaked. The pack trapped heat against my spine and the sweat had nowhere to go and by the second switchback my shirt was plastered to my skin and the shirt was rubbing against the pack frame in a way that would, by nightfall, produce a raw stripe across both shoulder blades that would hurt for five days.

By the first switchback I was breathing hard. By the second I was sweating through my shirt despite the cold. By the third I was making sounds that were technically breathing but sounded more like a large animal being slowly inflated. And somewhere around the third switchback my inner thighs began to chafe — the fabric of my jeans, damp with sweat, grinding against skin with every step, a specific humiliation I was not going to mention to anyone, least of all Sienna, who was walking thirty yards ahead with the easy stride of a person whose body was designed for this.

I threw up on the fourth switchback. Just leaned over, hands on knees — the pack nearly tipping me forward onto my face — and threw up my breakfast onto the leaves beside the trail. Sienna glanced back. She didn't stop. She didn't comment. She looked, assessed that I wasn't dying, and kept walking.

This was the nicest thing she'd ever done for me.

Ruth was slow. Her knees — she'd mentioned them, dryly, in the way she mentioned all her physical limitations, as facts to be noted and then ignored — ground audibly on the steep sections, a sound like sand in a joint. Jim stayed with her, matching her pace exactly, his hand appearing at her elbow on the switchbacks and disappearing on the straights, the automatic choreography of a man who had spent a career walking beside people who needed him.

Caleb fell twice. The first time he tripped on a root hidden under leaves and went down hard, skinning both palms. He cried — briefly, sharply, the cry of a child who is hurt but not broken — and Dale picked him up and brushed the leaves off and said "What do we do when we fall?" and Caleb, still sniffling, said "Get up" and Dale said "That's right" and they kept walking. The second time was on a rock scramble near the ridgeline where the trail crossed exposed sandstone. Caleb's shoe slipped and he slid three feet before Marcus caught him — one hand, casual, the reflexes of a man who'd been catching things that slid for twenty years.

Dale's hands were shaking. Not the cold — the Suboxone. He'd taken his last dose that morning. The withdrawal wouldn't hit fully for another twelve to twenty-four hours, but the edge of it was there — a tremor in the fingers, a tightness in the jaw. He carved as he walked, and the carving was a little rougher than usual, the strokes a little less controlled, and I watched him the way I watched everything: from behind, measuring, cataloguing, unable to help.

---

On the last rock scramble before the ridge, Marcus stopped and cut a length of river cane from a thicket beside the trail — five feet long, thumb-thick, the kind of cane that grew along every creek bottom in the Ozarks. He stripped the leaves and handed it to Ruth.

"Walking stick," he said. "Use it."

Within an hour everyone had one. Marcus cut them from cane and small hardwood saplings, sizing each to the user. The difference was immediate — a third point of contact on the rocky sections, something to brace against on the steep descents, a way to test footing before committing weight. I hadn't known I needed one until I had it. Then I couldn't imagine walking without it.

We made the ridgeline by late afternoon. Seven hours for three miles. In the old world, an hour's walk. In this world, an odyssey.

The ridgeline opened up. The trail ran along the spine of the ridge, sandstone outcrops on both sides, the forest canopy thinning to let the sky through. And the sky was — I don't have the word. I'd been looking at sky through steeple louvers and kitchen windows for three weeks. This was sky without a frame. Huge and blue and cold, the late-autumn clarity that comes to the Ozarks in November when the humidity dies and the air turns to glass.

To the east, the river valley spread out below us — thirty miles of lowland, the river a silver thread, the towns invisible at this distance but present as smudges of grey where the roads converged. Down there, the world was ending. From up here, you couldn't tell. The valley looked the way it had looked for ten thousand years: patient, indifferent, the land not caring what happened on its surface.

To the west, more ridgelines. Rolling, forested, extending to the horizon in diminishing blue layers like a painting of itself. The OHT ran along those ridgelines — we could see the next rise, and the one after that, and the one after that, each one a day's walk, each one a promise and a threat.

The forest was quiet.

Not the quiet of the town — not the held-breath silence of a world monitoring itself for danger. This was living quiet. Wind in the remaining canopy leaves, a dry rattle that sounded like paper. A creek somewhere below, audible only as a texture in the air. The skitter of a squirrel or chipmunk in the underbrush — a real animal, doing real animal things, unbothered by the end of human civilization.

No Turned.

The population density up here was zero before the outbreak. The terrain — steep, rocky, pathless off-trail — was hostile to the collective behavior. The organism coordinated on flat ground and in built environments. Dense forest with ravines and bluffs broke the signal, scattered the herd, turned the Turned back into confused individuals who wandered rather than hunted. Marcus had been right. The mountains were empty.

"Camp here," Marcus said. He'd found a bluff overlook — a sandstone shelf jutting out from the ridge, fifteen feet wide, protected on three sides by rock and forest. The view ran east into the valley. The bluff face dropped fifty feet — nothing was climbing up. The trail continued along the ridge behind us, the only approach a narrow path through thick undergrowth.

We made camp. Marcus and Sienna strung tarps between trees at the edge of the bluff — the lightweight ones from Atwoods, rigged with paracord, angled to shed rain and block wind. We rolled out sleeping pads on the rock — thin foam, not much padding, but insulation between body and stone. The pads were narrow. The rock was uneven. Sleeping would be a generous description for whatever happened on those pads tonight, but they were better than bare sandstone, which was like sleeping on a cold shelf in a walk-in cooler.

Ruth sat on the folding camp chair Maria had insisted on carrying — three pounds of aluminum that Maria had defended against every objection about weight with the flat declaration "Ruth sits or Ruth doesn't walk tomorrow." Dale carved. The wood he was working was cedar — aromatic, reddish, he'd picked it up at the trailhead — and the smell of cedar shavings mixed with the cold stone and leaf rot of the ridge and made something that smelled like a world that was still possible.

We ate freeze-dried beef stew reconstituted with creek water heated on the camp stove. The portions were small. The portions were always going to be small. I could have eaten three of them and still wanted more. Everyone ate carefully, slowly, making the meal last, because making it last was the only way to pretend it was enough.

After dinner, the conversation nobody wanted to have: gear.

"We packed too much," Marcus said. He was looking at the pile of equipment we'd hauled up six hundred vertical feet. The extra water containers — unnecessary, since every hollow had a creek. The camp shovel. The hatchet handles that duplicated the ones on our belts. The second cooking pot. The heavy canned goods Maria had added as backup. Dale's second tarp. The extra paracord. "Every ounce we carry tomorrow, we carry up another ridge. And the ridge after that. For sixty miles."

The math was brutal: thirty-two pounds felt manageable in the church parking lot. It was not manageable on a switchback. My shoulders were bruised. My hips were raw. Ruth had barely made three miles, and her pack was the lightest.

We went through everything. The psychology of discarding was harder than the weight itself — everything felt essential until you'd carried it uphill. The shovel felt essential. The extra water felt essential. The big cans of soup that weighed twice what the freeze-dried meals weighed felt essential because they were *food* and food was the thing you thought about constantly and the thought of leaving food behind was physically painful.

We left the shovel. The extra water containers. The second pot. The heavy cans — we ate what we could that night, added them to the stew, forced ourselves full. Two of the three tents went; we'd keep one for Ruth and Caleb and sleep under tarps. The redundant paracord. A bag of tools nobody had used. By the time we were done, the discard pile looked like a yard sale on a sandstone shelf, and the packs were five pounds lighter, and five pounds was the difference between arriving and not.

"All you think about when you're walking is food," Marcus said, watching the pile. "All you think about when you're resting is gear. What you can drop. What you don't need. That's hiking. That's the whole thing."

Jim held a prayer. Short: "Thank you for this day. Thank you for these legs. Particularly Ruth's, which performed heroically."

Ruth: "My legs do not require divine commentary."

Jim: "They're getting it anyway."

Marcus lit a small fire — carefully, in a depression in the rock, the smoke rising into the canopy and dispersing. "No population up here," he said. "Nothing to attract. And the smoke disperses in the canopy before it clears the trees." He'd built fires on overnight hauls, sleeping by the side of his truck. He knew which fires were safe and which weren't, the same way he knew which roads flooded and which ridgelines were exposed.

Caleb fell asleep in Dale's lap, the beagle in one hand and the half-finished cardinal in the other. Dale's hands shook and he held the boy steady and the tremor in his hands didn't travel to the child, and the effort of keeping the two things separate — the shaking and the holding — was visible in his face as a tightness that nobody mentioned.

Marcus pointed at the sky. "Orion," he said. To Caleb, who was asleep and couldn't hear. "Rising in the east. See the belt — three stars in a line. And there —" He pointed. "The Pleiades. Seven sisters. My dispatcher used to call me the seventh sister because I was always the last one in." He said this to the sleeping boy and to nobody else, and the constellations were there — brighter than I'd ever seen them, brighter than I knew stars could be, because there was no light pollution for fifty miles in any direction and the sky was doing the thing it had always been doing and we'd just been too busy to see.

We talked for a long time that night. Not about the trail or the plan or the Turned — about before. Ruth told us about her husband, Gerald, who had died in 2019, and how he'd made the worst coffee in Johnson County and she'd drunk it every morning for forty-one years and never told him. Marcus described the first time he saw Ava walk — three steps from the coffee table to the couch, arms out, face split with a grin that was nothing like the grin the Turned wore because it was real, it was *for* something, and the difference between a smile that means joy and a smile that means nothing is the entire distance between us and them. Maria talked about growing up in El Paso and how her mother had organized the kitchen by color and how she'd thought it was crazy until she grew up and organized everything by system and realized she was her mother's daughter after all.

Jim said, "My wife's name was Eleanor. Not the same Eleanor. She made peach cobbler that could make you believe in God." That was all he said about her. It was enough.

Sienna leaned against my shoulder at some point and neither of us acknowledged it. The fire had burned low and the warmth was on one side and the November cold was on the other and the shoulder contact was a small, specific thing that didn't mean anything except that it meant everything, and I am putting it in the journal because the journal should contain the truth, and the truth is that I was sitting on a rock in the Boston Mountains at eleven o'clock at night with a girl's head on my shoulder and the Milky Way overhead and I was happy. Briefly, unsustainably, illogically happy. It passed. But it happened. And I want that on the record.

I wrote by firelight. The notebook was wrinkled from the septic tank and smelled faintly of things I wouldn't name. The pen was a ballpoint from Ruth's purse. The fire popped and the smoke rose and the stars were out and behind us the trail continued into the dark, climbing the next ridge, and the next, and the next.

I crawled into my sleeping bag on the foam pad and every muscle in my body announced its displeasure. Legs. Back. Shoulders. The specific, grinding ache of muscles that had been used for the first time and were now stiffening in the cold, contracting, turning into concrete. The pad kept me off the rock but didn't do much else — I could feel every contour of the sandstone through the foam, and the bag was warm enough but narrow, and I couldn't find a position where something wasn't pressing against something else.

The forest was not quiet. I'd thought forests were quiet — the peaceful silence of nature, the soothing sounds of the wild. This was a lie invented by people who had never slept in one. Something large crashed through the dead leaves thirty feet from camp — loud, thrashing, the sound of a body moving through undergrowth with no regard for stealth. My heart rate jumped before Marcus said, from his post by the fire, "Possum." A possum. A five-pound marsupial that sounded like a bear stampede when it walked through dry oak leaves. An armadillo followed twenty minutes later — the same thrashing, the same cardiac event, the same eventual identification. Then deer, their hooves cracking sticks in the dark. Then something unidentified that rustled and stopped and rustled and stopped and I never found out what it was and lay in the dark imagining options until my body surrendered to exhaustion and the imagination shut off.

We all smelled like smoke and sweat. The fire provided warmth for whoever was on watch — Marcus took first shift, Jim second — but the smoke got into everything. Hair. Sleeping bags. Clothes. The smell would be our constant companion. I'd stop noticing it by Day 3.

That night I dreamed I was in the trailer. Everything was right — the paneling, the counter, the burn mark. But the trailer was moving. Not on wheels — being dragged, the whole structure shuddering, the floor tilting, and through the kitchen window the trees were not the park's trees but the OHT forest, oaks and hickories scrolling past as the trailer was pulled through terrain it was never built for. I could hear the skirting tearing underneath, the vinyl shredding against rock, and I ran to the back door and opened it and the drop was not the gravel lot but a ravine, a hundred feet of empty air, and the trailer was sliding toward the edge and I couldn't stop it because you can't stop a house.

I woke to the sound of wind in the canopy and for three heartbeats I didn't know which world was real — the forest or the trailer — and my hand found my wrist and counted and the count was high, one-ten, one-oh-six, and I lay still and watched the fire embers and breathed until the numbers came down and the trailer dissolved and I was on a rock in the Boston Mountains and the stars were the only things that hadn't changed.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #13:**

*The trail is hard. Ruth is struggling. Caleb fell twice. I threw up on the second switchback and —*

*I was going to write "Sienna pretended not to notice, which is the nicest thing she's ever done for me." But I caught myself. The joke. The self-deprecating deflection. The bit where I'm the fat kid who can't handle a switchback and isn't it funny. Sienna told me to stop building the case for my own helplessness and I'm still doing it, automatically, the way you bite your nails — not because you decide to but because the hand finds the mouth before the brain intervenes.*

*So here's what actually happened: I threw up on the fourth switchback and then I kept walking. I kept walking because stopping wasn't an option and because the pack on my back was the heaviest pack in the group — thirty-two pounds that ground my hips raw and bruised my shoulders and turned my inner thighs into a chafing disaster I will never discuss with anyone — and I was carrying it because I could, because my body — the one I've been apologizing for since page one of this notebook — carried thirty-two pounds up a mountain switchback and didn't stop. The throwing up was what happened. The not-stopping was what I did. Those are different things. I'm trying to learn the difference.*

*Nothing tried to kill us today. Nothing used a familiar voice. Nothing stood in a parking lot wearing someone's face. The forest is empty of the thing that's ending the world, and the emptiness is the closest thing to safety we've found.*

*Dale is starting withdrawal. I can see it in his hands. He held Caleb through it and the boy didn't feel the shaking and I don't know how Dale did that but it's the bravest thing I've seen anyone do and I've seen Sienna sprint through a herd of Turned carrying a seven-year-old.*

*From the ridge you can see the valley. Down there, the world is ending. Up here, the oaks are going bronze and the stars are out and it's the most peaceful I've felt in a month. I think this is what normal is going to feel like for a while: exhausting and terrifying and better than the alternative.*

*We dumped five pounds of gear tonight. The shovel, the extra water, heavy cans, a tent. Everything feels essential until you've carried it up six hundred vertical feet. Then you'd leave your own shoes behind if they weighed an ounce less.*

*Fifty-seven miles of trail to go, then another thirty-five on the highway. At today's pace, three miles a day, the math is catastrophic. Ruth's medication runs out before we get there. But Marcus says the pace builds — that bodies adapt, that the first day is always the worst. The math never quite works. We walk anyway.*

# Chapter 20: The Other Group

On Day 29, five days into the walk, the trail descended from the Boston Mountains to cross a state highway, and we found the other group.

We'd been warned — the OHT drops into lowland at road crossings, and road crossings were the danger. Marcus had mapped every crossing on the route, noted which ones had towns, which ones were isolated. This one had a town — a small highway settlement, the kind that exists because two roads intersect and someone built a gas station. Population: maybe eight hundred before. The trail crossed the highway half a mile east of the town center and climbed back into the forest on the far side.

We approached the crossing from the ridgeline, standard protocol by now: stop, observe, glass the terrain through binoculars before descending. I set up on a bluff overlook with the notebook and scanned the highway corridor.

The town was occupied. Not by Turned — by survivors.

A Walmart sat on the west end of town, the anchor of a small commercial strip. Vehicles had been arranged in a perimeter around the parking lot — trucks, SUVs, a school bus turned sideways to block the main entrance. Figures moved on the roof. Lights burned in the windows — generator-powered, the same telltale hum I recognized from the Lyles. Someone had strung razor wire along the vehicle perimeter. Someone had spray-painted SURVIVORS INSIDE on the side of the school bus.

I counted Turned: maybe twelve, scattered along the highway, drifting in the standard patrol pattern. Low density. The town's small population meant fewer Turned, and the commercial strip's open parking lots meant the herding behavior was dispersed rather than concentrated. The Walmart group was in a better position than the Lyles had been — more space, fewer Turned, a bigger structure.

But the pattern was there. I could see it the way you see a word you've already read: the perimeter, the noise, the armed patrols on the roof. The count was low now. It would climb. It always climbed.

"We need supplies," Maria said. She'd been counting our food for five days and the count was not good. "We're at seven days of rations. If we trade some medication —"

"We can't trade medication we need."

"We have surplus propranolol. We have hydroxyzine. We have benzodiazepines we're holding in reserve. Those have value to people who don't understand the mechanism yet — they'll trade for the tranquilizers because tranquilizers are what frightened people want." She paused. "I'm not proud of this. But the exchange rate between our surplus anxiolytics and their canned goods is favorable."

I looked at her. Maria had a gift for framing moral compromises as accounting problems, and the framing made them easier to accept and harder to argue with. Trading medications that would help these people survive in exchange for food we needed to survive was not a clean transaction. It was the prisoner's dilemma again: cooperate or exploit. Maria had found a middle path that was both.

---

We descended in the afternoon. Dale was bad.

The Suboxone had been gone for two days and the withdrawal was no longer a tremor in the hands. It was a full systemic event — sweating despite the cold, muscles cramping, a nausea that bent him double every thirty minutes. The textbook described opioid withdrawal as "profoundly uncomfortable but rarely life-threatening." The textbook had not considered a context where the symptoms of withdrawal — the anxiety spike, the autonomic activation, the flood of stress hormones — were the exact biochemical signature that could convert you from human to infrastructure.

We'd managed it. Propranolol for the heart rate. Clonazepam for the acute anxiety. Jim's breathing exercises, which Dale performed with the grim determination of a man who had spent twelve years in recovery and was not going to let pharmacology undo it. But the management was imperfect. Dale's resting heart rate was 94 — higher than anyone's in the group, higher than I was comfortable with, dangerously close to the range where the organism might start paying attention.

He walked. He carved. The cedar piece had become a fox — ears back, body low, running. The strokes were rougher than Dale's usual work, but the shape was there. His hands shook and the fox emerged anyway.

"How are you doing?" I asked. Stupid question. I asked it anyway.

"I'm doing the hard thing that works," he said. Quoting himself from the overpass argument we hadn't had yet — except he was already living it, had been living it for twelve years, the daily practice of choosing the painful correct thing over the comfortable wrong thing. Recovery had trained him for this. Addiction had given him the vocabulary. And the irony — which he laughed about, bitterly, once, on the third night — was that the worst thing that ever happened to him had become the reason he was still alive.

"Rock bottom was just training," he said. "Turns out every meeting I went to, every check-in, every time I sat with a craving and didn't use — I was practicing for this. The craving is the same thing. The fear, the chemical demand, the body screaming at you to do the thing that will kill you because it feels like relief. Same mechanism. Different substance."

He looked at the fox in his hands.

"I'm going to teach you something," he said. "All of you. When we stop tonight. The things I learned in recovery — they're survival skills. Nobody calls them that. But that's what they are."

---

We approached the Walmart from the highway, walking slowly, hands visible. A man on the roof — mid-fifties, heavy, wearing a store vest over a hunting jacket — shouted down through a bullhorn.

"Stop there. Identify yourselves."

"Survivors from the river valley," Marcus called back. His voice carried — the truck driver's projection, tuned for loading docks and rest-stop diners. "Eight people, including a child and an elderly woman. We're passing through. Looking to trade."

A conversation on the roof — I could see three figures conferring. Then the man with the bullhorn: "Come to the side entrance. Slowly. No weapons visible."

We went. The side entrance had been reinforced — steel shelving stacked as a secondary barrier behind the glass doors. A man opened them. He was maybe forty-five, balding, wearing a name badge that still said PHIL — STORE MANAGER. He looked at us the way you'd evaluate a delivery: assessing volume, checking for damage.

"How many?"

"Eight. Seven adults, one child."

"Armed?"

"No."

Phil's eyes moved across us. Jim in his flannel, Bible visible in his jacket pocket. Ruth, leaning on a walking stick Dale had carved her on Day 2 of the trail. Dale, sweating, jaw clenched. Maria, standing slightly apart, already scanning the interior with the eye of a woman who was inventorying their inventory. Sienna, coiled. Caleb, holding Dale's hand. Marcus, big and still. Me, fifteen, overweight, carrying binoculars and a spiral notebook.

"You don't look like a threat," Phil said.

"We're not."

"Then what are you?"

"Tired," Jim said. "And willing to trade."

---

Phil's operation was impressive in the way the Lyles' had been impressive — competent execution of the wrong strategy. He had forty people inside the Walmart. Work quotas: stocking, cleaning, perimeter watch. Rationed food from the store's own inventory, which was substantial — a Walmart's supply chain holds weeks of food even after panic buying. Armed patrols on the roof, four-hour shifts, shotguns and hunting rifles sourced from the sporting goods section.

He'd built a society in a box store. It had rules, hierarchy, order. The lights worked. The PA system worked. Someone had organized the clothing section into a dormitory, sleeping bags between the racks, a kind of textile refugee camp lit by emergency lights.

It was the Lyles at scale. And it would end the same way.

I tried to tell Phil. Not in the supply aisle — in a side conversation, near the pharmacy section, where I'd gone to check their medication stock. Phil followed me, suspicious, territorial, the way a store manager follows a shoplifter.

"Your perimeter is attracting them," I said. "The generator, the lights, the armed patrols. The Turned are drawn to human activity. The count around your store is twelve now. In two weeks it'll be thirty. In a month —"

"In a month we'll have this place fully fortified. We're building a second perimeter. We have enough ammunition to hold this position for six months."

"The ammunition won't help when the count hits threshold. The fortifications —"

"Son." He said it the way Craig had said it — patient, dismissive, the voice of authority addressing a child who doesn't understand how the world works. "I've managed this store for eleven years. I've handled Black Friday crowds, hurricane evacuations, and a tornado that took the roof off the garden center. I know how to manage a facility under pressure."

"This isn't a facility. This is a target."

Phil smiled. The smile was professional — the customer-facing smile of a man who had spent a decade managing complaints. "I appreciate the concern. Is there something you'd like to trade?"

I traded. Not the argument — the medications. Maria handled the negotiation: six bottles of hydroxyzine and four of lorazepam for three cases of canned goods, a box of energy bars, two sleeping bags, and a pack of children's cold medicine for Caleb, who had developed a cough.

Phil's people took the anxiolytics gratefully. One woman — a pharmacy tech, I think — looked at the hydroxyzine and said "Oh thank God" and the relief in her voice was the relief of a person who had been managing panic with nothing and now had something. The medications would help. They would help for exactly as long as the Turned's count stayed below threshold, and then they would help no more, and Phil's fortress would follow the Lyles into rubble.

I could have pushed harder. I could have stayed. I could have drawn the diagram, shown the notebook, explained the density threshold with the data I'd accumulated over a month.

I didn't. Because Craig hadn't heard it. Because Phil wouldn't hear it. Because the truth about fortification — that it accelerates the thing it's designed to prevent — is a truth that requires you to abandon everything that feels safe, and people don't abandon safety on the word of a fifteen-year-old with a notebook. They abandon it when the walls come down, and by then it's too late, and by then I'm miles away and I can't hear the collapse and I carry the knowledge of it like a stone in my chest.

---

We left the Walmart in the late afternoon and climbed back into the forest. The trail ascended quickly — back into the oaks, back onto the ridgeline, back into the empty quiet of the mountains. Below us, the highway town shrank to a cluster of rooftops, the Walmart a grey rectangle with tiny figures on its roof.

That evening, at camp, Dale taught us HALT.

"Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired," he said. We were sitting around a small fire on a sandstone shelf, the stars coming out above the canopy gap. Dale's hands were shaking but his voice was steady — the voice he'd used in meetings, in check-ins, in the daily practice of staying alive. "You don't make decisions in those states. Any of those states. Your brain lies to you when you're hungry. It lies differently when you're angry. And when you're tired — when you're exhausted and scared and the whole world is wrong — your brain will tell you the stupidest idea you've ever had is the only option."

He looked around the fire. "How many of you are hungry right now?"

Everyone.

"Angry?"

Ruth raised her hand. Maria almost did.

"Lonely?"

Nobody raised their hand. Nobody needed to.

"Tired?"

Everyone.

"That's four for four. You're all in HALT right now. Every decision you make tonight is compromised. So here's what we do: we don't make decisions tonight. We eat, we sleep, we make decisions tomorrow when at least one of those four is resolved. In recovery we call this 'urge surfing' — you ride the urge without acting on it. The urge passes. It always passes. The bad decision doesn't."

He paused. The fire popped.

"Tired is the most dangerous of the four," he said. "Tired is the one that feeds the others. You can manage hunger, you can manage anger, you can manage loneliness — if you're rested. But tired means sleep, and sleep means your chemistry goes unsupervised. In recovery, we relapse at night. In this —" He gestured at the dark beyond the fire. "In this, tired means the watch rotation matters more than anything. The person who stays awake so the rest of us can sleep is the person who keeps the chemistry supervised. The most important job we have is the one nobody wants — sitting in the dark, watching people breathe, making sure nobody's brain decides to betray them while they're dreaming."

Jim, from his side of the fire: "That sounds like faith."

Dale looked at him. "It sounds like data. The relapse rate for decisions made in HALT states is over seventy percent. That's not faith. That's statistics."

"Statistics and faith aren't —"

"Mutually exclusive," the group said, more or less in unison, and Jim laughed — a real laugh, surprised and warm — and the fire popped and the stars turned and we didn't make any decisions.

Dale was quiet for a while. Then he said, to the fire more than to us: "I dream about using. Every night. Not drugs — the knife." He held up the fox carving, the blade catching firelight. "In the dream, the knife is the wrong shape. The blade curves where it shouldn't. And the wood won't hold a form — I carve and carve and the shavings fall and the shape underneath is always the same shapeless lump. I can't make it into anything." He turned the fox in his hands. "Recovery dreams. You'd think they'd stop after three years. They don't stop. They just change what you're recovering from."

Maria put her hand on his knee. Not a gesture — a placement. Deliberate, firm, the hand of a woman who had spent six years watching this man fight something invisible and had learned that the fight sometimes needed a physical anchor.

"The carving is the opposite of the dream," Dale said. "In the dream, nothing holds its shape. In the morning, the wood is still the fox. The real thing is more durable than the dream. That's the lesson. That's always the lesson. But the dream doesn't know that, so it keeps coming back."

In the morning the world was slightly less wrong than it had been the night before.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #14:**

*Phil is going to die the same way the Lyles did and for the same reason and I couldn't talk him out of it either. Same pattern. Same cognitive dissonance. Same unshakeable conviction that the skills that worked before will work now. I've tried three times — Jim, Craig, Phil — and failed three times. Maybe the reason I keep failing isn't that I'm bad at talking. Maybe it's that the truth is something people have to arrive at on their own, and by the time they do, it's usually too late.*

*Dale is teaching us recovery skills. HALT. Urge surfing. Radical acceptance — the practice of acknowledging reality without trying to change it or deny it. "The situation is what it is," he says. "Your feelings about the situation are not the situation." This is the most useful sentence anyone has said to me in a month and it came from a man in opioid withdrawal who learned it in a folding chair in a church basement five years ago.*

*Rock bottom was just training. The worst thing that happened to Dale gave him the exact skills this world requires. Wrong reasons. Right answers. The pattern holds.*

# Chapter 21: The Overpass

On Day 33 I killed thirty people and I need to tell you about it in the way it actually happened, which is quietly, from a hillside, by doing math.

The trail descended from the Boston Mountains to cross State Highway 21 — one of the road crossings Marcus had flagged on the map. These crossings were the exposed moments: leave the forest, cross the lowland, climb back into cover. Most had been uneventful — empty roads, scattered Turned in ones and twos, easily avoided. This one had a problem.

The highway interchange included an overpass — a concrete span carrying a county road over the state highway. The overpass was old, built in the 1970s, the kind of infrastructure that had been on a deferred maintenance list for twenty years. The concrete was crumbling at the expansion joints. The guardrails were rusted. On the upper deck, two semi-trucks had been abandoned — one a flatbed hauling lumber, the other a fuel tanker, its cylindrical tank catching the late-morning sun.

Under the overpass, in the shadow of the concrete span, a cluster of Turned had gathered. Twenty-five. Maybe thirty. Standing in the dim space where the highway passed under the bridge, milling in slow circuits, drawn to the infrastructure the way they were drawn to all human-built things — the echoes, the geometry, the residual smell of diesel and asphalt and a thousand cars that had passed through before the world stopped. The terrain funneled them: the highway rose on embankments to meet the overpass, creating a bowl beneath the span where the Turned collected like water in a drain.

I studied it from the treeline for an hour. Through the binoculars I could see the supports — four concrete columns, each maybe three feet in diameter, cracked where the rebar was corroding, where decades of freeze-thaw cycles had worked the concrete apart. The deck above was loaded: the two semis plus the weight of the road surface plus whatever water and debris had accumulated on the asphalt. The supports were holding all of it, barely, the way an old man holds a heavy door — upright, functional, but not by much.

The alternative crossing was two miles south — a ford across the highway where the road dropped to grade level. But between here and there, the terrain was open: fields, pasture, a mile of exposure with no tree cover. And the Turned from the overpass cluster would be between us and the ford. Going around added a day — south to the ford, across, then north on exposed lowland to rejoin the trail. A day we didn't have. Ruth's atenolol supply was at five days. Dale's withdrawal was managed but precarious — his resting heart rate still hovered in the low 90s, and a day of exposed walking would push it higher.

I looked at the overpass. I looked at the supports. I looked at the Turned clustered under the span.

The idea arrived the way ideas arrive — complete, unwanted, already too detailed to be unnamed. It was the thought I'd had watching the Lyles' house come apart, the one I'd written in the private journal and hadn't shown anyone. The roof section that took out six of them. The way they didn't dodge. The way the frenzy made them destroy everything in reach including each other. The quarry off Route 7.

I didn't want the idea. I want that recorded. I want it known that the thought of using the overpass — of deliberately triggering a swarm and letting the resulting frenzy bring the structure down on top of them — arrived in my mind as something repulsive, something I immediately tried to reject, something that felt like a door I was not supposed to open.

The door opened anyway.

---

I proposed it to the group at the treeline. Not dramatically. In the flat, analytical voice that was my default when the thing I was saying was too large for inflection.

"We set up a noise source — the hand-crank radio, or just banging on metal — about a hundred yards north of the overpass. It draws them out, concentrates them. When the count is high enough, the density tips them into frenzy. When they frenzy near the supports, they'll attack the structure. The supports are failing already. The load on the deck — the trucks, the tanker — it's too much for compromised columns. The overpass comes down. The trucks come down with it. We wait at distance. When it's over, we walk through."

Silence. The particular silence of people processing something they weren't prepared to hear.

Jim spoke first. "Those are people, Nate."

"They were people." The sentence came out and I heard it and the sound of it was the sound of a line being crossed. Not the words — the tone. The detachment. The way I said "were" without flinching. I wanted to flinch. I couldn't afford to.

"They're still people," Jim said. "Somewhere in there, they're still —"

"Jim, I know. I know they have memories. I know the organism uses those memories. I know that somewhere inside each of them is a person who had a name and a family and a life. I know all of this. And I also know that between us and the trail on the other side of that highway are thirty of them, and Ruth has five days of medication, and Dale's heart rate is at 93, and we don't have a day to go around."

"There's always another way."

"There isn't always another way. Sometimes the other way is worse and the only honest thing to do is say so."

The argument expanded. Sienna opposed it — not on Jim's grounds, not theology. Instinct. "It feels wrong. It feels like — Nate, you're talking about engineering a mass casualty event. You're talking about setting a trap."

"I'm talking about using the frenzy's own destructive behavior against a compromised structure in a controlled context. The frenzy happens without us — it's happened at the Lyles', at the ranch house, at every concentration point I've observed. We're not creating a new threat. We're directing an existing one."

"That's a rationalization."

"Maybe. But it's also true."

Marcus, from his position at the edge of the group: "The ford crossing adds a day. A day of open exposure. Ruth can't do a day of open walking — not at her pace, not in this terrain. And Dale —" He looked at Dale. Didn't finish the sentence.

Dale finished it himself. "When I was using," he said, "my counselor told me that recovery means choosing the hard thing that works over the easy thing that feels right. This is the hard thing."

The group looked at him. Dale — shaking, sweating, five days into withdrawal, holding the fox carving in one hand and a knife in the other — had reframed the moral question with the vocabulary of a man who'd spent a decade learning to distinguish between what felt right and what was right. In recovery, the thing that feels right is the relapse. The comfortable choice. The one your brain screams for. The hard thing — the meeting, the check-in, the daily grind of choosing not to use — is the thing that works.

"This is the meeting," Dale said. "This is the part where you sit in the folding chair and you don't want to be there and you do the thing anyway because the alternative is worse."

Jim looked at Dale. Something passed between them — the pastor and the addict, two men who had spent their lives in folding chairs in basements, arriving at the same place from opposite directions.

"I won't be part of it," Jim said. Not angry. Quiet. Certain. "I'll stay back with Ruth and Caleb. I'll pray."

"For us?" I asked.

"For them." He meant the Turned. He meant the thirty people under the overpass who were about to die because a fifteen-year-old with a notebook had done the math. "You do what you need to do, Nate. I'll do what I need to do. And if we're both right, God can sort out the difference."

---

Marcus and Sienna set up the noise source. The hand-crank radio, tuned to static, volume maxed, jammed into the passenger seat of a wrecked car on the highway shoulder a hundred yards north of the overpass. The static carried — that white-noise hiss, audible for a quarter mile in the silence. I could hear it from the hillside where Dale and I were positioned, two hundred yards south, above the interchange, looking down through the binoculars.

The Turned responded. The cluster under the overpass began drifting north — slowly, drawn by the sound, the collective orientation shifting like a compass needle. More came from the east, from the fields beyond the highway. More from a house I hadn't spotted, emerging from a garage in single file. The count climbed: twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five. They converged on the area between the overpass and the noise source, milling, tightening, the density compressing as more arrived.

Marcus and Sienna withdrew — south along the highway shoulder, moving fast but not running, back to the treeline where Jim and Ruth and Maria and Caleb were waiting. I watched them through the binoculars. They were clear. The Turned were focused on the noise, not on the retreating figures.

I counted. Thirty-five. Forty. The cluster was directly under the overpass now, the density at its highest where the embankments funneled them into the bowl beneath the span. The behavior was changing — the twitchiness I'd first observed at the Walmart, the restless, jerky movements, the heads snapping toward nothing. The droning started. Low, resonant, building.

Dale was beside me. His hands were shaking but his breathing was measured — the recovery breathing, the slow counts he'd been practicing for twelve years. He was watching the Turned below and his face was the face of a man who understood craving in all its forms and was choosing, again, the hard thing.

"It's happening," I said. Meaning the threshold.

"I see it," he said.

The shudder. The phase transition. One moment they were milling, individual, restless. The next they were a single thing — a collective body, convulsing, the coordinated patience of the herd snapping into the undirected violence of the frenzy. The sound changed: not the drone but a roar, multi-throated, the sound of forty human vocal cords producing something that was not a human sound.

They hit the overpass supports. Not because they were aiming — because the supports were what was there. The nearest column took the first impact: bodies, dozens of them, pressing and pushing and tearing with the mechanical fury of the frenzy. Concrete cracked. I could hear it from two hundred yards — a sharp report, like a gunshot, as the rebar inside the column sheared. The column held. Then the second wave hit, and the column didn't hold.

The deck shifted. Two inches, then six, then a foot — the road surface tilting as the column gave way, the weight of the semis sliding toward the low side. The fuel tanker rolled first — slowly, massively, the cylinder turning on its axis, picking up speed as the deck tilted further. It went over the edge.

The impact was unlike anything I have a comparison for. Ten thousand gallons of diesel fuel in a steel cylinder falling twenty feet onto concrete and bodies. The tanker ruptured on impact — not an explosion, not at first, just a splitting of steel and a wave of fuel that spread across the highway in a dark sheet. Then the lumber truck followed, sliding off the collapsing deck, the flatbed hitting the road surface and shattering into a spray of pine two-by-fours and steel. Then the deck itself — the concrete span, crumbling at the compromised joints, falling in sections, each section a multi-ton slab of reinforced concrete dropping into the space where the Turned were frenzying.

The fuel ignited. I don't know what sparked it — friction, electrical, the impact of steel on concrete. The diesel went up in a rolling flame that I felt on my face from two hundred yards, a wave of heat that smelled like every truck stop Marcus had ever hated.

Dust. Fire. The sound of structural collapse — a grinding, crumbling, continuous sound that lasted maybe thirty seconds and then subsided into the crackle of burning diesel and the settling of rubble. The overpass was gone. The highway was buried under a mound of concrete, steel, lumber, and fire. The Turned who had been underneath were — I didn't look through the binoculars. I didn't need to. The physics were clear.

Some survived. They always did. I could see them at the edges — stumbling out of the dust and debris, broken, confused, the frenzy spent. A man with one arm hanging wrong, wandering into the field. A woman, face bloodied, sitting on the highway shoulder the way you'd sit after a car accident, dazed, absent. They'd disperse. The post-frenzy scatter. In an hour the highway would be empty except for the rubble and the smoke.

Dale's hand was on my shoulder. I hadn't noticed him put it there. His hand was shaking — the withdrawal — but the grip was firm.

"Breathe," he said.

I breathed. I realized I'd been holding my breath since the deck shifted. How long? A minute? Two?

"It's done," he said.

"It's done."

---

The group walked through at dusk. The fire had burned itself out. The rubble was still warm underfoot — I could feel it through my shoes, the residual heat of diesel and concrete.

Nobody spoke.

I stepped over a hand protruding from the rubble. I saw it — the hand, the fingers, the wrist. I did not look at it and I did not look away from it. I looked at it the way I looked at everything: directly, completely, recording. The hand was female. The nails had dirt under them. There was a ring — a gold band, a wedding ring. Someone's wife. Someone's mother. Someone who had been a person before the organism made her part of a collective, and who was now buried under the ruins of an overpass because a fifteen-year-old had done the math and the math had said this was the optimal outcome.

Caleb was on Marcus's back, face buried in Marcus's shoulder. Marcus was talking to him — a low, steady murmur about nothing, about truck stops, about what kind of ice cream was best, keeping the boy's world small and warm while the real world burned and crumbled under their feet.

Jim walked last. He walked through the rubble with his head bowed and his lips moving and he was praying — for the dead, for the Turned, for the people who had been people before they were debris. I watched him and I understood that Jim's prayer and my math had arrived at the same event from different directions, and that the event was the same regardless of which road you took to get there, and that the difference between us was not in the outcome but in what we carried afterward.

Jim would carry the prayer. I would carry the hand.

That night, camped on the ridgeline above the highway, I wrote by flashlight because the fire we built was too far from where I was sitting and I was sitting apart because I didn't want to be near people and I didn't want to be alone and both of these things were true at the same time.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #15:**

*We killed approximately thirty people today. I say "approximately" because I couldn't get an accurate count. I say "people" because I don't know what else to call them. I say "we" because it was my idea.*

*Jim wouldn't look at me during dinner. Sienna looked at me too much. Marcus gave me a cup of water and said "drink this" the way you talk to someone in shock, and I think maybe I am.*

*Here is what I know: we are all alive, including Caleb, including Ruth, and we are one day closer to the university.*

*Here is what I don't know: whether that math justifies what we did.*

*Here is what I'm afraid of: that I'll get used to it.*

*Here is what I'm more afraid of: that I need to.*

*Dale sat with me for an hour after dinner. He didn't say anything. He carved the fox. His hands were shaking and the fox was beautiful and the shaking and the beauty existed in the same hands and I think that's the truest thing I've learned about people — that the damage and the craft come from the same place and you don't get one without the other.*

*Tomorrow we walk. The trail climbs back into the mountains. The next road crossing is in four days. I'll have a plan by then. I'll have a plan because that's what I do now. I make plans that involve other people dying so that my people can live, and I write them in a notebook and I execute them from a safe distance and I carry the results in my chest like stones and the stones are getting heavier and I'm fifteen and I don't know how many more I can carry before the weight of them changes me into something I don't recognize.*

*Sienna asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said "Liar." She was right. She's always right about the things I don't say.*
