# Chapter 15: Sienna Runs

On Day 18, Sienna did the bravest and stupidest thing I have ever witnessed — and the septic tank only risked my own life.

I was in the basement inventorying the pharmacy haul when she came down the stairs from the steeple moving faster than I'd ever seen her move indoors.

"There's a kid," she said. "Two blocks south. In a yard. Alone. Crying."

The basement went still. Jim looked up from his Bible. Dale's knife paused. Maria, at the pantry, turned around.

"How old?" Jim asked.

"Young. Six, seven. A boy. He's sitting in the yard of that yellow house on Birch — the one with the swing set. He's just *sitting there,* and there are Turned on the next block and he's *crying,* Jim, he's crying and they're going to find him."

I was already moving to the stairs. "Let me see."

In the steeple, through the binoculars, I found him. A small figure in the yard of a yellow clapboard house — sitting in the grass next to a swing set, knees to his chest, rocking. I couldn't hear the crying from this distance but I could see it in his body: the shaking, the way his head dropped and lifted, the convulsive rhythm of a child who has been alone too long and has reached the end of whatever reserves a seven-year-old has.

Three Turned were visible on Birch Street. One block south of the child. Walking slowly, drifting, their standard patrol. They hadn't oriented toward him yet, but the crying — even at distance, even muffled by the glass of the steeple — was a sound that carried, and if I could see him from here, the Turned's network would register him soon. Crying is fear made audible. The organism would hear it the way a shark hears blood.

"We need to get him," Sienna said. She was behind me on the stairs, and her voice had a quality I hadn't heard before — visceral, primal. This was not a strategic calculation for her.

"We need to think about —"

"He's seven, Nate. He's Jaylen's age. He's sitting in a yard *crying* and there are three of them one block away and if we don't go now —"

"If we go now without a plan, we risk —"

"Then I go." She was past me on the stairs, moving down. "I go alone. I'm fast. I can get there and back in four minutes."

"Sienna, *stop.*"

She stopped. Not because I had authority — I had a notebook and a history of hiding in septic tanks. She stopped because something in my voice caught her, the same way her hand on my elbow caught me during the crossing.

"Running is the thing that kills people," I said. "You know this. You watched the soldiers. You told me yourself — the sergeant who stopped fighting was the one who survived. If you run two blocks, your heart rate goes to 160, 170, and you're carrying a crying child, and your adrenaline is spiking because of his fear and your fear feeding each other, and —"

"I know the mechanism, Nate."

"Then you know running is —"

"I know." Her eyes were bright — intensity, not tears. "I'm not going to let a seven-year-old die because I'm managing my heart rate. I know the math. I know the risk. And I can't."

Jim was at the bottom of the stairs. He'd heard everything. He looked at Sienna and something passed between them. Jim, who had put the sign in the window. Jim, who had made coffee. He recognized what Sienna was doing because it was what he'd been doing for two weeks, and the fact that the organism punished it didn't make it wrong.

"Go," Jim said. "Walk as far as you can. Run only if you have to. And Nate —" He looked at me. "Watch. Guide her back."

Sienna took the walkie-talkie from the charging shelf. Jim took the other. He didn't go to the steeple — he stayed on the ground floor, near the side door, because someone needed to be ready to open it fast and someone needed to be in the steeple, and I was already moving up the stairs.

---

I watched from the steeple. The walkie-talkie was in my left hand, the binoculars in my right.

Sienna left through the side door. She moved south on the residential streets, fast-walking — not running, not yet, but moving at the limit of walking speed, her athlete's body covering ground efficiently. Her posture was controlled. Her arms were at her sides. She was doing everything right.

Block one. Two Turned in a yard to the west.

"Two in the yard to your left," I radioed. "They're tracking but not moving. Keep your pace."

They tracked her — the head-turn. Didn't approach. She was moving fast but not panicking. The blood pressure cuff was on her wrist; I could see her glancing at it. Managing. Measuring. The runner who couldn't run, calculating her pace against her chemistry.

She reached Birch Street. The yellow house was there. The child was there — still in the yard, still rocking. From this angle, closer now, I could see his face: dark hair, light skin, streaked with dirt and tears. Seven, maybe six. Wearing pajamas and one shoe. He'd been alone for days — you could see it in the way he held himself, the fetal curl, the complete abdication of the vigilance that even children maintain when they believe someone is coming. He'd stopped believing.

Sienna approached him. Slowly. She crouched down. She was talking to him — I couldn't hear the words. The child looked up. His face changed — the blank despair breaking into something raw and desperate, the face of a drowning person seeing a hand.

He reached for her. She picked him up.

And the three Turned on the next block turned toward them.

---

Here is what I saw from the steeple and what I did about it.

I saw Sienna pick up the child. I saw the child clutch her neck and press his face against her shoulder and I saw his body convulse with sobs — real sobs, the kind that shake the whole frame — and I saw the sound of those sobs ripple outward like a stone dropped in water because the three Turned on the south end of Birch had stopped drifting and were walking toward the yellow house with a purpose that wasn't their standard patrol.

I keyed the radio. "Three incoming from the south. Moving with purpose. You need to go now."

I saw Sienna stand. I saw her assess — the child on her hip, the Turned incoming, the two blocks back to the church. I saw the moment she made the calculation and the moment the calculation said *run.*

She ran.

She ran the way she was built to run — long stride, balanced, the biomechanics of a girl who'd trained for the 400-meter since she was twelve. Even carrying a child, even with the wrong shoes and the cracked asphalt and the two blocks of residential street between her and safety, she was fast. She covered the first block in maybe forty seconds.

"Jim, she's running. One block out, coming fast. Get the door."

Through the binoculars I watched her face. Her mouth was open. Her chest was heaving. And her expression was the thing I'd been afraid of — something beyond fear, her body doing exactly what the organism needed. I could see the flush climbing her neck and her jawline, the exertion and the adrenaline merging into a single biochemical signal, and the Turned behind her were closing — more of them now, emerging from between houses, drawn by the crying and the scent of terror, five, six, seven.

"Seven behind her. Converging from side streets. She's fast but they're drawn by the kid's screaming."

The child was screaming. Not words — a continuous wail, the sound of a child who has been alone for days and has been picked up by a stranger and is being carried at a sprint through a world that has stopped making sense. The sound carried. Every Turned in a two-block radius was orienting toward it.

Sienna reached the church's block. Fifty yards to the side door.

"Fifty yards, Jim. Door open. She's coming in hot." She was sprinting flat out and the child was screaming and behind her the Turned were converging and I could see — through the binoculars, at magnification, in the kind of detail I didn't want — the moment something changed in her stride.

A hitch. A falter. Her right foot caught the asphalt wrong and she stumbled half a step and caught herself and kept running but the stumble wasn't fatigue. I'd seen her run — she didn't stumble. She was too good, too trained. The stumble came from inside — a disruption in the signal between brain and body.

She was at the edge.

She described it to me later — the warmth. A spreading heat that started in her chest and moved outward, into her arms, her face, her skull. A buzzing, subsonic, like the drone the Turned made but from inside, vibrating through the bones of her skull. The self loosening — as if the thing that held "Sienna" together was being gently pulled apart from the inside. The organism finding the gap between body and identity and pressing into it.

She was twenty yards from the door.

Jim had the door open. He was standing in the threshold with his arms out, the posture of a man catching something falling. Sienna crossed the parking lot. The child was screaming. She was running. The Turned were fifteen yards behind — close enough that I could see their faces through the binoculars, the smooth blankness, the absence of expression that was its own kind of expression.

She made it through the door.

Jim slammed it shut. I heard the bolt. From the steeple, two floors up, I heard the bolt engage and I heard Sienna hit the floor — not fall, collapse, the controlled descent of a body that has been pushed past its limit and is shutting down to protect itself.

Then I heard something else. A sound I couldn't identify — sharp, flat, like a book being slapped against a table. Then silence. Then the child crying again, but differently now, a scared cry instead of a desperate one. Then Jim's voice, low and urgent, words I couldn't make out from two floors up.

I watched the Turned arrive at the door. Seven of them. They stood in the parking lot. They didn't try the door. Below threshold — seven wasn't enough for the frenzy. They stood and they waited and after forty minutes they drifted away.

---

I came downstairs.

Sienna was on the basement floor. Ruth had a blanket over her. The child — later we'd learn his name was Caleb, Caleb Reeves, seven years old, from the yellow house on Birch, parents gone since Day 2 — was in Maria's arms, not Jim's. That was the first thing I noticed. The second thing was the bruise.

It was on Sienna's left jaw, below the ear. Fresh — the skin darkening from red to purple, the swelling just starting. The kind of bruise that comes from a closed fist, not a fall. I looked at it and then I looked at Jim and Jim was sitting in a pew with his hands between his knees, staring at the floor, and his right hand was wrapped in a wet cloth and he was holding it the way you hold something that has betrayed you.

Dale told me later. In pieces, the way Dale told everything — carved out slowly, the details emerging one at a time.

Sienna had come through the door and collapsed and Jim had caught her and the child, and Sienna was on the floor and she was safe and it should have been over. But it wasn't over. Her heart rate wasn't coming down. The sprint, the child's screaming, the Turned fifteen yards behind her — the adrenaline had momentum and being inside the church didn't stop the chemistry the way slamming a door stops a pursuer. She was on the floor and her eyes were wrong. Not closed — open, but unfocused, the pupils blown wide, and she was making a sound that wasn't words and wasn't the drone but was somewhere between them, a low continuous moan that Dale said made the hair on his arms stand up because it sounded like the beginning of something.

Jim had knelt beside her. He'd taken her face in his hands. He'd said her name — "Sienna. Sienna, look at me. You're safe. You're in the church. Sienna." And she'd looked at him but the look wasn't recognition. It was the blank, smooth, unfocused gaze of someone whose self was leaving the building.

"Her skin was hot," Dale said. "Jim touched her face and jerked back like he'd touched a stove. And her color — you could see it. Not green, not yet, but wrong. Flushed past red into something that didn't have a name. Like sunburn but from the inside."

Jim made the decision in less than a second. Dale said he didn't hesitate, didn't warn her, didn't wind up. He just closed his fist and hit her — a short, sharp blow to the jaw, the kind of punch that comes from someone who learned to fight fifty years ago and has spent every year since choosing not to. Sienna's head snapped sideways. Her eyes rolled back. She went limp.

The moan stopped.

Maria was already there with the blood pressure cuff. She'd strapped it on before Jim's hand had unclenched. "142 over 95," she said. Then thirty seconds later: "138 over 92." Then: "It's coming down. It's coming down."

Jim hadn't moved. He was kneeling beside an unconscious eighteen-year-old girl he'd just hit in the face, and his hand was shaking — not fear-shaking, not the kind the organism produces, but the deep tremor of a man whose body was rejecting what his brain had decided to do. Ruth brought him the wet cloth without being asked. He wrapped his hand and sat in the pew and didn't speak.

Sienna came to about four minutes later. Confused, disoriented, the bruise already spreading. Jim told her what he'd done before she could ask. "I hit you," he said. "You were past the breathing. You were past your name. I hit you because I didn't know another way to stop it and I am sorry and I would do it again."

She'd looked at him for a long time. Then she'd said, "Good."

That was it. Good. The word of a person who understood exactly what had almost happened and who was grateful to be conscious and bruised and alive and still herself, and who knew that Jim had done the hardest thing anyone had done since the world ended — not the punch, which was mechanics, but the decision.

Jim was still in the pew. He didn't look up. Ruth was beside him but not touching him — present, not intruding. The group had rearranged itself around the event the way water rearranges around a stone: Dale carving, Maria counting, Ruth attending, Jim sitting with the weight of what saving someone cost when saving them looked like violence.

Sienna's hands were shaking. Not the small tremor Marcus had shown during the pharmacy run — a full-body vibration, deep, the kind that starts in the core and radiates outward. She was wrapped in the blanket and shaking inside it and her eyes were closed and her face was wet and the bruise on her jaw was a dark purple now, vivid against her brown skin, and she was breathing in the pattern Jim had taught — four in, hold, six out — but the pattern was ragged, broken by the shaking, the breathing of a person who was holding herself together with technique because everything else had failed.

I sat next to her. On the floor. Not touching. Present.

"I felt it," she said. Eyes still closed. "The edge. I know where it is now."

"You came back."

"Barely." A breath. "It's not a line, Nate. It's not a threshold you cross. It's — it's a dissolving. You start to come apart. Not all at once. The edges go first. The parts of you that are optional — your name, your history, your preferences. They start to feel like clothes you're wearing instead of skin. And the thing that's dissolving them isn't violent. It's gentle. It's the most terrifying thing about it. It feels like being invited to stop being yourself. Like the organism is saying, 'You can put this down now. You can stop carrying all of this. Just let go.'"

I didn't say anything. I knew exactly what she meant — the warmth, the invitation, the loosening — and I didn't say so because the septic tank was mine to carry and hers was hers. I sat next to her and said nothing because anything I said would be insufficient.

"I almost did," she whispered. "For half a second. I almost let go. Not because I wanted to turn. Because I was so tired of being afraid and it was offering me a way to stop. And the only reason I didn't is that Caleb was in my arms and if I let go he'd fall."

She opened her eyes. They were red. She looked at me.

"You were watching."

"From the steeple. Yes."

"I heard you. On the radio. The whole time." A pause. "Three incoming from the south. She's coming in hot." She said it in my voice — flat, steady, the voice I'd used because steady voices keep other people steady and because controlling the voice was the only thing I could control. "You got Jim to the door."

"Yes."

"And you stayed in the steeple."

"Jim told me —"

"I know what Jim told you. And I know you guided me back and I know you called the Turned count and I know you got the door open. I'm not asking what you did with the radio. I'm asking what you would have done if the radio wasn't enough."

I didn't answer. The answer was: I don't know. From the steeple, through binoculars, I'd guided Sienna through two blocks of converging Turned, and I'd gotten Jim to the door. But she wasn't asking about the radio. She was asking whether I'd have come down the stairs and run into the street, and I didn't know. At least a coward has made a decision.

"You did the right thing," she said. "Staying. Watching. Not following. If you'd come after me, I'd have had to worry about you, and worrying about you would have pushed me over. You staying put kept me below the line."

"That's rational."

"It's also true. Are you going to accept it or are you going to punish yourself?"

"Both, probably."

She almost smiled. The ghost of the laugh she'd given me after the septic tank. Then the almost-smile faded and she closed her eyes again and the shaking continued and I sat next to her and didn't touch her, and the not-touching was its own kind of contact.

Caleb was asleep in Maria's lap — she'd taken him when Jim couldn't hold anything anymore, and the boy had curled against her with the instinct of a child who doesn't care whose arms they are as long as arms exist. Seven years old. Pajamas and one shoe. He'd survived for days alone in a house where his parents had turned, hiding under his bed, drinking water from the bathroom tap, eating cereal from the box. He'd come outside because he couldn't stand being alone anymore, and that was louder than the fear. He was crying in the yard because he was choosing company over safety.

Seven years old and he'd made a choice that most adults couldn't make. Sienna had honored that choice by running. I had honored it by not running. And the organism had learned — because it was always learning — that the small, crying ones could draw the fast, brave ones into range.

I didn't write this last thought in the journal. Some observations are too ugly to record.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #10:**

*Sienna almost turned today saving a kid. She did the right thing and it almost killed her — not killed her, worse than killed her. Killed is an ending. Turning is a continuation in a form that uses your face and your voice and your memories to hunt the people you loved.*

*I guided her from the steeple. Called the Turned positions, warned her when the three oriented, got Jim to the door. It wasn't nothing. I keep telling myself it wasn't nothing because "nothing" is the word that fits what it felt like. The safe thing. The smart thing. Sienna says I kept her below the line by staying put. I believe her. It was also the cowardly thing and I don't know if those are different things anymore.*

*The Turned don't punish bad people. They punish brave ones. They punish the ones who run toward the crying. They punish the instinct that makes humans human — the impulse to help, to connect, to risk yourself for someone else. The organism has designed a world where kindness is a death sentence and selfishness is a survival strategy. I don't know what kind of world that is. I don't know what kind of person survives it. I'm afraid the answer is: my kind. The kind who guides from a distance. The kind who calculates. The kind who stays in the steeple with a radio and calls it "enough."*

*Caleb is seven. He's asleep in Maria's lap. Jim is in a pew with a wet cloth around his hand because he punched an eighteen-year-old girl in the face to keep her from turning, and the punch worked and the cloth is for the shaking, not the knuckles. Dale is carving Caleb a dinosaur because Sienna asked him to and Dale would carve anything Sienna asked him to because everyone would do anything Sienna asked them to because she is the person who ran toward the crying while the rest of us watched from windows.*

*Eight people now. Fifteen days of food at current rationing. The cost of doing the right thing is 1.3 days. Maria was right about the arithmetic. She's always right about the arithmetic. The arithmetic is not the point.*

That evening I found Jim on the church steps. He was sitting on the concrete with his wrapped hand in his lap, looking at the parking lot where the Turned stood in their positions. The bruise on Sienna's jaw was upstairs. The hatchet blood was in the boiling pot. The two events — the punch and the kill — were sitting in Jim's body like stones, and I could see them in the slope of his shoulders.

I sat next to him. The concrete was cold.

"That was Gary Sutton," he said. Not looking at me. Looking at the lot. "The one Marcus killed. He coached Little League for fifteen years. Taught those boys to throw a curveball."

I didn't say anything. I waited.

"I watched him for three days before Marcus went out there. His hands." Jim raised his right arm, miming a motion — the wrist snap of a sidearm throw, repeated, mechanical. "Over and over. The same pitch. The organism is using his hands to repeat the motion because it's stored in his muscles, in his motor cortex, in the part of him that learned it so deeply it became automatic."

"Or the organism is just replaying a motor loop," I said. "The way a record plays a groove. It doesn't mean Gary was experiencing it."

"Tom Hadley conducts the choir. Gary threw curveballs. Pembrook stands at his mailbox. Every one of them is doing something they did when they were people. You don't think that means anything?"

"I think it means the organism has access to procedural memory. Motor patterns. Muscle memory. That's not the same as consciousness, Jim. A recording of a person isn't a person."

"At what point does the recording stop being the person?" He looked at me now. His eyes were red from the day and from the night and from the punch. "If I played you a recording of your mother's voice — her actual voice, saying something she actually said — would you tell me there's no part of her in that recording?"

The question landed wrong. He knew it landed wrong. He didn't apologize because the question wasn't about apology. It was about the line between a person and the residue of a person, and he was asking me to tell him where that line was because he'd just punched an eighteen-year-old girl to keep her on one side of it and a man he'd served coffee to had just killed a man who might have been on the other side of it and Jim needed to know — needed someone to tell him — that those two acts weren't the same thing.

"At what point does running on a loop stop being human?" I said.

Jim was quiet for a long time. The Turned swayed in the lot. Tom Hadley's hand twitched — the conducting motion, brief, automatic. Gary Sutton was gone. His position in the lot was empty. What Marcus had left on the gravel was bones now — scattered, picked clean, the durable architecture of a human being stripped of everything the organism could use. The organism disposed of its dead by consuming them. Jim had watched that too.

"At what point does killing someone who can't fight back stop being murder?" Jim said.

Neither of us won. Neither of us tried to. We sat on the church steps in the cold and watched the Turned repeat their loops and we held two positions that couldn't both be right and might both be true, and the space between them was the space where every hard decision in the next three weeks would live.

Jim stood up. He put his good hand on my shoulder.

"I don't know the answer," he said. "But I trust you to keep asking the question. Even when the answer scares you. Especially then."

He went inside. I stayed on the steps until the cold drove me in.

The next morning Ruth brought me tea — chamomile, from a box she'd found in the church kitchen, brewed over a candle. She sat across from me at the folding table and sipped hers and said nothing for a while, which was unusual for Ruth, who generally said things the way other people breathed — constantly and with conviction.

"I dream about Leonard," she said. Not looking at me. Looking at the tea. "Every night since this started. He's standing in the yard. Our yard, the house on Poplar Street. He's wearing his work clothes — the blue Dickies, the boots with the left heel worn down. And I know he's turned. In the dream, I know. His face is smooth and his posture is wrong and he's standing in the garden where he grew tomatoes for forty years, and he's one of them."

She sipped her tea.

"The worst part isn't seeing him. The worst part is that I'm *relieved* he's already dead." She said this calmly, the way she said everything — with the precision of a woman who'd spent thirty-nine years choosing words for a living. "He died in 2019. Heart attack on a job site. And every night I dream that he's turned, and every night I wake up relieved that the heart attack got him first, and the relief is — it's obscene, Nate. Being grateful that your husband died before the world ended. Being grateful that he's in a cemetery and not standing in a parking lot with a smooth face."

She set her cup down.

"I'm telling you this because you think you're the only one who doesn't sleep. You're not. None of us sleep. We just don't talk about it because talking about it means admitting that the things we carry at night are the things we can't carry during the day, and during the day we have to function." She stood. "Your tea is getting cold. Drink it. Chamomile is good for anxiety and it's better than that dreadful instant coffee."

She went upstairs. I drank the tea and wrote what she'd told me in the notebook and underlined *none of us sleep* because it was the truest thing anyone had said to me in weeks.
