# Chapter 8: The Church of Whoever's Left

## ACT TWO: CONGREGATION
### *"Turns out the apocalypse is mostly committee meetings."*

---

Jim made coffee. The church kitchen had a two-burner Coleman propane stove that someone had donated for fish fries. He lit it with a match and boiled water and poured three cups and the smell of it was so ordinary that my knees went soft. Sienna took hers black. I took mine with enough sugar to qualify as dessert because I was fifteen and had the palate of a fifteen-year-old and I did not care that Sienna watched me dump three packets of sugar in and raised one eyebrow.

Jim sat across from us and studied our faces. He took his time. He was deciding how much to tell us.

"How did you get here?" he asked. Not the route. He meant: how did you survive?

I told him. The window. The watching. The pattern — everyone who panicked turned, everyone who stayed calm didn't. I told him about the textbook and the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenaline cascade. I talked too long. I always talk too long when I'm nervous and I was nervous because this was the first adult I'd spoken to in five days who was alive and sane and I wanted him to take me seriously.

Jim listened without interrupting. When I finished he nodded once, slowly, the way you nod when someone confirms something you already believed for different reasons.

"The Lord protects the peaceful," he said. "That's what I've been telling myself. The meek shall inherit the earth — I always read that as a promise about the afterlife. Turns out it might be operational advice."

He'd been watching the same pattern I had. The people who prayed, who sat still, who surrendered to something larger than their fear — they survived. The people who fought, who panicked, who trusted their own strength — they turned. Jim had framed it as theology. God's hand, sheltering the faithful. His conclusion was identical to mine: *stay calm, don't fight, don't flee.* His reasoning was completely different.

"Jim," I said. "What medications are you on?"

He set his mug down. "That's personal, son."

"It matters."

He looked at me the way adults look at you when you've asked a question that forces them to take you seriously — the slight recalibration, the moment where "kid" becomes "person." "Metoprolol. Fifty milligrams, twice a day. For my heart."

"It's a beta-blocker. It suppresses the sympathetic nervous system — the adrenaline response. That's why they don't bother you."

Jim picked up his coffee. Sipped it. Put it down.

"Those aren't mutually exclusive," he said. "The medication and the peace."

He was right in a way I was too smart to understand at the time. The metoprolol kept his body under the threshold. His faith kept his mind there. His faith had produced the sign in the window, which saved at least three lives. My correct understanding of the mechanism had produced a notebook.

I would learn, later, to hold both truths at once — Jim's theology and my pharmacology, both incomplete, both functional, pointing at the same survival behavior from opposite directions. Most people resolve contradictions by collapsing one side — picking the explanation that feels better and discarding the other. Jim didn't. He held "God protects the peaceful" and "metoprolol suppresses the HPA axis" in the same hand and didn't flinch. That capacity would turn out to be more important than either truth alone. The people who survived this world would be the ones who could let their assumptions and their observations coexist long enough for something useful to emerge from the friction.

But I didn't understand that yet. I just thought Jim was wrong for the right reasons. Wrong reasons, right answers. I would see this pattern until it broke me.

Jim watched me process this. Then he made his decision.

"There are others," he said. "Downstairs."

He'd opened his door to us, given us coffee, listened to our story — but he'd kept the others hidden until he was sure. I understood later what Jim had been doing, because I watched him do it again with Marcus. He had a system, unwritten but consistent.

First: he'd watched us cross the highway. The Turned hadn't reacted. That was the minimum — proof we were under threshold, still human enough that the organism wasn't interested. But that was necessary, not sufficient. Turned could mimic. The Knock had taught me that.

Second: the coffee. Jim made coffee for everyone who came through his door, and it wasn't hospitality — it was a test. He watched your hands. How you held the mug. How you adjusted your grip when the ceramic was too hot, the tiny unconscious corrections a living brain does without thinking. Turned could mimic speech with disturbing fidelity. But sustained fine motor behavior — the sipping, the way a person sets a mug down and picks it back up with a slightly different grip each time — was harder to fake. Jim watched our hands the way I watched the Turned through binoculars: looking for the thing that didn't fit.

Third: the conversation. Not the content — the duration. Turned could produce fragments, targeted phrases. But extended back-and-forth? Sustained dialogue with appropriate responses and emotional modulation? Jim talked to us for thirty minutes before showing us the basement. He was running a diagnostic.

I understood this. I would have done the same thing.

"Let me see your hand," said a voice from the stairwell.

Ruth Fenn was seventy-two years old and she came down the stairs the way she apparently did everything: with complete authority and zero patience. She was five-foot-two, white-haired, wearing a cardigan over a floral blouse, and she looked at me the way she'd looked at a thousand seventh-graders who'd come to class without their homework.

"I said let me see it."

I held out my hand. She unwrapped the sock — her nose wrinkled at the sock — and examined the bite with the clinical attention of someone who knew exactly what she was looking at. "Cellulitis. Early stage. You're running a fever."

"How do you —"

"I taught for thirty-nine years. Do you know how many children I sent to the nurse's office with infected cuts, ringworm, impetigo, and one memorable case of scabies? I can spot an infection from across a classroom." She turned to Jim. "Antibiotic ointment. First aid kit. And something that isn't a *sock.*"

She cleaned the wound with hydrogen peroxide from the church's first aid kit, applied antibiotic ointment, and bandaged it with actual gauze and medical tape, all while narrating what she was doing and correcting my grammar.

"You bit yourself? Deliberately?"

"To keep from making noise."

"Hm. Resourceful. Unsanitary. The word is 'bit,' not 'bited,' if you were wondering."

"I wasn't."

"You were about to be." She taped the gauze with the precision of a woman who had applied approximately ten thousand Band-Aids in her career. I noticed — because I notice things, it's what I do instead of being useful — that her hands were not quite steady. A slight tremor, controlled by decades of classroom discipline, but there. Ruth Fenn was afraid. The grammar corrections, the brisk authority — all of it was armor. She corrected grammar the way Dale carved wood: to keep her hands busy with something she could control while the world came apart around her. "Your mother is Delia Carver. I taught her. Mediocre student, excellent human being. She would be appalled by this bandage."

"She would."

"She'd also be proud of you. Don't let that go to your head." She patted the bandage once — firm, not gentle — and returned upstairs to the sanctuary where she was, Jim said, reading a romance novel and had been for two days.

She came back ten minutes later with two capsules in her palm. Amoxicillin — from the church's emergency supply, the kind churches keep for mission trips. Expired, she said, by fourteen months. "Expired antibiotics lose potency but they don't become poison. Take one now, one tomorrow. It might slow the infection. It won't stop it. You need a real course from a real pharmacy."

I took them. The expired amoxicillin did what expired amoxicillin does — not enough. The fever broke on the second night but the red streaks held. Ruth changed the bandage every morning, inspected it, said "hm" in a tone that conveyed either satisfaction or disappointment and I could never tell which. The cellulitis didn't spread but it didn't retreat either — it sat there, hot and stubborn, a low-grade infection my immune system was fighting to a draw. It became one more item on the list of things we needed from the pharmacy.

After the pharmacy run — amoxicillin, real amoxicillin, a full ten-day course — the infection surrendered in three days. By then I'd been carrying it for two weeks and had mostly stopped noticing it, the way you stop noticing anything that hurts consistently enough. It scarred — a crescent of tooth marks on the meat of my palm that whitened as it healed. I still have it. I'm looking at it right now.

---

The Sotos were in the basement.

I learned about Dale and Maria Soto in fragments, sideways, through the small behaviors that replace conversation when the context for normal conversation no longer exists.

Dale carved. He sat in a metal folding chair with a chunk of two-by-four and a folding knife and he carved constantly — small, precise strokes, wood shavings collecting at his feet like a second skin. I watched him for ten minutes before I realized he was making something specific: a beagle, ears down, in the posture of a dog waiting.

"I'm on Suboxone," he said, without looking up, because he'd caught me looking. "Maintenance. For opioid use disorder, which is the polite way of saying I was a junkie for six years and now I take a pill that keeps me level. My counselor said I was 'chemically balanced.' What she meant was my emotions don't spike. In normal life that's a problem." Stroke, stroke, curl of wood falling. "In this, it's the only reason I'm alive."

Maria was reorganizing the food pantry closet. She'd taken everything off the shelves, sorted it by category and expiration date, and was reloading it according to a system that made sense only to her. Ruth appeared at the bottom of the stairs and watched for a moment.

"Alphabetical would be more practical," Ruth said.

"Caloric density per unit of weight," Maria said, without turning around. "The heavy, low-calorie items go in the front. You eat those first while you're stationary. The light, high-calorie stuff goes in the back — that's what you grab if you have to move."

"That's not alphabetical."

"No. It's correct."

They stared at each other. Two women whose response to the end of the world was to organize whatever was in front of them, now locked in a silent territorial negotiation over a closet full of canned corn.

"I suppose," Ruth said, "that 'fewer calories' is at least grammatically sound."

Maria almost smiled. It was a small, bitter thing — the kind of smile that says *I see you and I don't have the energy to fight but I'm not conceding.* "I was an office manager for nine years. I organized a filing system for a law firm with eleven attorneys who all had different ideas about what 'alphabetical' meant. I can organize a food closet."

"I'm sure you can, dear." Ruth went back upstairs.

Maria finished the closet. I noticed she'd arranged it so the heavy items — canned vegetables, jars of sauce, the things with the most weight per calorie — were at the front and bottom, easy to reach, meant to be consumed first while we were sheltering in place. The light, calorie-dense items — jerky, nuts, protein bars, dried fruit — were in the back and on the top shelf, packed tight and ready to grab. If we had to leave in a hurry, you'd sweep the top shelf into a bag and go, and what you carried would be light and would keep you alive the longest. It was the organizational logic of someone who had already accepted that staying wasn't permanent.

"How long will this last?" I asked. Meaning the food.

"Sixteen days at current rationing. Twenty if we cut portions. Less if more people arrive." She said this the way you'd read a weather forecast — factual, without opinion.

"More people will arrive."

"Then less." She closed the closet. "That's how it works. Every person we help is a day we lose. I'm not saying don't help. I'm saying know the cost."

---

That first evening in the church, with the seven of us gathered in the basement by candlelight because the overhead fluorescents hummed at a frequency Jim worried carried through the walls, something happened that I didn't expect and don't have a clinical term for: we became people to each other.

Not all at once. In pieces. Ruth told a story about a student who'd brought a live frog to class in 1987 and how she'd confiscated it and kept it on her desk for the rest of the year and named it Fitzgerald. Dale showed us the beagle he was carving and said it was for his daughter, who was in Fayetteville, who he hadn't spoken to in two years because of things he'd done when he was using, and who he was going to find. Maria described her filing system at the law firm — eleven attorneys, eleven different ideas about alphabetical order — and it was the closest thing to a joke she'd told since we met her, and Jim laughed, and the sound of Jim laughing in the basement of his church while the world ended outside was so incongruous and so human that I almost cried.

Sienna sat next to me. Not touching. Just near. She'd found a can of peaches in the pantry and was eating them with a plastic fork, and at one point she offered me one and I took it and the peach was sweet and cold and perfect and the conversation had moved on to something else and I ate the peach and didn't say anything and the moment didn't need me to say anything.

I want you to know about these hours because they matter as much as the crises. Surviving isn't just the running and the hiding. It's also the peaches. It's also the frog named Fitzgerald. Small ordinary moments that remind you what you're surviving *for* — a question the notebook and the binoculars can't answer.

---

Sienna couldn't sit still.

By the second day we'd established a protocol for the steeple — two-hour observation shifts, binoculars, the notebook for logging Turned positions. The steeple was the best tactical asset we had: a hundred-foot sightline in every direction, elevated, with louver openings on all four sides. The problem was communication. Seeing a threat meant nothing if you couldn't warn the people on the ground.

Jim solved it. He'd been cleaning out the children's ministry closet — Vacation Bible School supplies, construction paper, glue sticks, a felt Noah's Ark — and found a pair of walkie-talkies. FRS radios, the kind you buy at Walmart for twelve dollars so your kids can play secret agent in the backyard. Bright yellow plastic. Range: maybe a mile, less with walls. The batteries were half-dead. We had spares from the church's emergency kit.

"Toys," Maria said, looking at them.

"Radios," I said. "One in the steeple, one on the ground. The person watching can talk to the person moving. Range is short but we're working in a six-block radius. It's enough."

They were cheap and tinny and the transmission button stuck if you pressed it too hard. They were also the difference between a watcher and a guide. The steeple became a nerve center.

On the second day, Sienna announced she was going to scout the surrounding blocks. Not asked — announced. I opened my mouth to argue and she said, "I'm not asking," and took one of the walkie-talkies and left through the side door before Jim could finish saying "Be careful."

She came back three hours later.

I was in the steeple with the other walkie-talkie and the binoculars, and I'd tracked her for the first two blocks before she moved out of my sightline. We'd used the radios twice — once when I spotted a cluster of three Turned drifting south on Maple and warned her to detour east, once when she'd reached the interchange and I couldn't see her and her voice came through the static saying "I'm fine, stop asking" in the tone of someone who needed to not be managed. The radios weren't perfect. The range dropped in and out, the static was constant, and there were dead zones behind the larger buildings where the signal vanished entirely. But when I watched her cross Highway 21, moving well, I'd known she was coming because she'd radioed from two blocks out. Then I watched her face as she came through the side door, and I knew something was wrong — her expression flat, postponing whatever she'd seen.

She climbed to the steeple. We sat on opposite sides of the narrow space, the binoculars between us, the late October sun cutting through the louvers.

"The interchange," she said. "I went to the interchange."

"Sienna —"

"The military vehicles are still there. Humvees, trucks, the whole perimeter. Some of the Turned are still in the area — maybe fifteen, twenty. They're scattered. Not coordinated like the ones here." She paused. "The bodies are still there too. The ones who died in the firefight. Soldiers who were shot before they turned."

I waited.

"The Turned are eating them."

The steeple was very quiet. Below us, through the floor, I could hear Dale's knife on wood.

"It's methodical. They crouch over the bodies and they — they *take pieces.* One at a time. Carefully. Like they're rationing. There are maybe six bodies left out of what was probably — I don't know, however many died in the gunfire. There were more. You can tell. There were more."

Her hands were in her lap and they were steady. Her voice was steady. But her eyes said the floor had opened up beneath her last standing assumption.

"I was wrong," she said. "About going back there. The Turned are congregating around the bodies as a food source. Going there for equipment means going through them while they're feeding. And they noticed me. Not the herding behavior. They looked at me the way a dog looks at you when it's eating and you get too close. Protective. Territorial. I've never seen them do that before."

She paused. "And there was a sound. When the one closest to me looked up — it made a sound. Short, sharp, not like the drone. More like a bark. A chirp. And two others, maybe thirty yards away, immediately oriented toward it and started moving in my direction. Not the slow drift. Fast. Purposeful. Like the sound was a signal — *food here, come now.*"

"And the soldiers," she added. "The ones that turned — some of them had taken off their body armor. Kevlar vests, jackets, helmets, stacked in piles next to the vehicles. Not scattered — removed. Deliberately. Like the equipment was uncomfortable, or in the way of something."

"That's new," I said. "All of it. The herding behavior is about reproduction — about scaring you into turning. What you're describing is about calories. Those are different drives. And the sound — that's not the summoning drone. That's something else. Something directed."

"I know what it is, Nate. You don't need to categorize it for me. They were eating people."

She was right. But categorizing was what I did instead of feeling, and feeling would mean sitting with the image of Turned crouched over human remains and processing what it meant for the future — that when the Walmart food ran out, the Turned would remember that people are made of calories.

"The supplies," I said. "Was there anything accessible without going through the feeding area?"

"Maybe. The trucks at the back of the perimeter. I couldn't get close enough to check. I'd need to go back. With someone." She looked at me. "Not yet. I need to — I need to not think about it for a while."

I wanted to say something useful. Something analytical that would reframe the horror into data. Instead what came out was: "Are you okay?"

It was a stupid question. She wasn't okay. Nobody was okay. But she looked at me and her face did something I hadn't seen before — a crack in the composure, brief, quickly sealed — and she said, "No. But I'm here. That counts."

We sat in the steeple and watched the sun move across the parking lot. The Turned below shifted with it — that slow collective turn, faces tilting toward the light. I watched Sienna's profile against the louver slats and the sunset light caught her jaw and her throat and my brain did the thing again, the useless thing, the *notice this* thing, and I looked away.

"Jaylen's seven," she said. After a long silence. "He's obsessed with dinosaurs. He can name every species in the Cretaceous period. When I left for school in the morning he'd be at the kitchen table with his dinosaur books and he'd quiz me. 'Sienna, what's bigger, a T-rex or a Giganotosaurus?' I always got it wrong on purpose because it made him so happy to correct me."

She was quiet.

"I don't know if he's alive," she said. "Oklahoma City is big. The population density. If they didn't make it to my grandmother's before —" She stopped. Took a breath. "I can handle the Turned. I can handle what I saw today. I can't handle not knowing about Jaylen. That's the thing that's going to break me, if something does."

"It won't."

"You don't know that."

"No. But you walked through a military staging area full of — through *that* — and you came back and you're here and you're telling me about it. Whatever breaks you, it isn't this."

She looked at me. The expression was unreadable. Then she said, "You're not bad at this."

"At what?"

"At being a person. You think you're bad at it. You're not."

I didn't know what to do with that so I looked through the binoculars. The Walmart across I-40 had a cluster of Turned in its parking lot — twenty, twenty-five, more than I'd seen there before. They were milling in a pattern I didn't recognize, tighter than their usual spacing, and some of them were twitchy — small jerky movements, heads snapping toward nothing, a restlessness that felt different from their normal stillness. Like a voltage building up. Like static before a storm.

I wrote it in the notebook: *Walmart cluster. ~25. Agitated. Something different about the group dynamics at this density. Watch this.*

I underlined "watch this" twice.

Before heading down I tried something. There was a stack of hymnals on the steeple shelf — dusty, dog-eared, left from before. I picked one up and dropped it out the louver opening. It hit the parking lot asphalt below with a flat crack that was startlingly loud in the silence.

The three nearest Turned oriented instantly — heads snapping toward the sound, bodies shifting weight, the beginning of movement. They took two steps toward the noise. Then three. I counted: thirty seconds of sustained attention. Then the interest faded. Their heads drifted back. They resumed their positions, the sound already forgotten.

A single noise was a glance — brief, distractable. But the Turned at the Lyles' house responded to the continuous bullhorn. A sustained noise was a summons. The stare, not the glance, was what brought them in.

I wrote this down. It seemed like the kind of thing that might matter later.

---

Jim held a service on Wednesday. Six people in candlelight. He read a psalm, said a prayer, was quiet. Ruth sang "Amazing Grace" — first verse, thin soprano, cracks on the high notes. The silence after was the most sacred thing I'd ever experienced, and I don't believe in sacred.

Later that night I dreamed I was back in the trailer. Everything was right — the wood-grain paneling, the burn mark on the counter, the Sprite and Saltines lined up neat. But the front door was open and someone was standing on the step, facing in, and the someone was me. Not a mirror — a second me, standing in the gravel in my gym shorts and the too-small Panthers t-shirt, looking in with a face that was smooth and blank and tilted slightly toward the porch light the way the Turned tilt toward the sun. The me in the doorway raised one hand. Not waving. Reaching. And I understood, in the dream-logic way where understanding doesn't require evidence, that if I took the hand I would never be afraid again, and the price of never being afraid was everything else.

I woke gasping in the church basement. My heart was hammering — I pressed my fist against my sternum and counted, the way I'd learned to, ninety-eight, ninety-two, eighty-six. Around me, the others slept. Dale's knife had stopped. Ruth was breathing in the measured rhythm of a woman who'd been falling asleep to the same internal clock for seventy-two years. I lay there until the count dropped to seventy and the dream faded from image to residue, and then I got up because the alternative was closing my eyes and seeing myself standing in the doorway again.

I went to the sanctuary and found Jim sitting in a pew in the dark, hands folded, staring at the cross on the wall. He didn't look like a man at peace. He looked like a man holding something heavy.

"Can't sleep either?" I said.

"I sleep fine." A pause. "I pray poorly." Another pause. "Do you know what the hardest part of faith is, son?"

"No."

"It's not believing when things are good. It's not even believing when things are bad. The hardest part is believing when things are *meaningless.* When there's no plan, no purpose, no lesson. When it's just — some biology gone wrong. Some accident nobody caused and nobody deserved and none of it was aimed at us."

I sat down. One pew back. Giving him the space.

"I've been a pastor for thirty years and a soldier before that. I've buried children. I've held dying men. And in all of it I found meaning because I believed God was in it somewhere, working through the suffering toward something I couldn't see. But this." He gestured at the walls, the darkness, the world outside. "This isn't suffering toward something. This is just — biology. Indifferent biology. And I keep waiting for God to show me the meaning and He keeps not showing me and I keep having faith anyway and I don't know if that makes me faithful or just stubborn."

"Does it matter?"

He looked at me. "It matters to me."

"I mean — does it matter *functionally*? You put the sign in the window. People are alive because of it. You're here making coffee and holding services and keeping people together. Whether God told you to do that or your own decency told you — the result is the same."

"That's a very young thing to say."

"I'm fifteen. Everything I say is young."

He almost smiled. Then the almost-smile faded and he was just a tired old man in a dark church. "I told Ruth the Lord protects the peaceful. And I believe that. But I also know it's the metoprolol, and I know it's the beta-blockade, and I know that if the medication runs out I'll have to find out whether my faith is strong enough to keep my heart rate below whatever the number is. And I don't know if it is."

He said this to me and not to any of the adults because I was the one who'd named the mechanism, and naming it had made me the person he could be honest with, and I didn't want that responsibility and I had it anyway.

"Your faith got us here," I said. "That's data."

"Data." He said the word like it was a foreign food he was willing to try. "I suppose it is."

He was quiet for a while. Then he said, almost to himself: "I had a dream last night. Water rising in a valley. People walking single file along a ridge — our people, I think, though I couldn't see faces. And a sound. Not music. A frequency. Like a tuning fork pressed against the bones of the earth."

He shook his head. "Probably the tinnitus. Vietnam gave me a lifetime supply."

I didn't say anything. It was a dream. People dream about water and walking and strange sounds. It didn't mean anything.

But I wrote it in the notebook later, because I write everything in the notebook, and months afterward I would read that entry and the hair on my arms would stand up, because Jim had described — exactly, precisely, in details he had no way of knowing — the herd crossing in the river valley and the frequency emitter at the university. He'd dreamed it on Day 7. We wouldn't live it until Day 40.

He sat in the dark pew and I sat behind him and neither of us said anything else and after a while I went back to the basement and lay on a pew and looked at the ceiling and thought about faith and pharmacology and the place where they overlapped, and I didn't sleep but I was closer to sleeping than I'd been in a week.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #3:**

*Day 7. Seven people. Fourteen Turned outside. The number's growing.*

*Three behavioral modes. Three different signals. The drone says "something is happening here" — herding, reproduction, fear-farming. The short sharp call says "food here, come now" — coordinated feeding. And something changes at density — the Walmart cluster is at twenty-five and the behavior is twitchy, restless, something building. I'm building a taxonomy that's growing faster than my understanding.*

*The Turned are shedding clothing. Pembrook's robe. The soldiers' body armor. The scrub woman's top. The oldest Turned are the most exposed. The sun-facing and the undressing have to be connected — the exposed skin is always the skin facing the light — but I can't see the mechanism yet.*

*Jim doubts his faith in private and performs it in public and the performance saves lives. I understand the mechanism in private and fail to act in public and the understanding saves nobody. Being right is not the same as being useful. Knowing is not the same as doing.*
