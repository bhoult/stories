# Chapter 2: The View from the Window

I woke up because the laptop was overheating on my chest and the fan was making a noise like a small animal dying. The screen had gone to sleep. The game was paused. Sunlight was coming through the living room blinds in those horizontal stripes that mean mid-morning, and I lay there for a minute in that groggy state where you know you fell asleep somewhere you weren't supposed to, and my first thought was: *Mom's going to be annoyed about the couch.*

My second thought was: *Mom's not here.*

I sat up. The trailer had that specific quality it gets when no one else has been in it for a while — still. But it was more than that: the trailer felt wrong. My mom's presence is what makes this place a home instead of a metal box. Her coffee mug on the counter. Her reading glasses on the arm of the chair. All of those things were still there, but they were artifacts now — evidence of a person who should be here and wasn't.

The Sprite she'd left me was warm on the counter. The Saltines were still in their sleeve, lined up neat next to the Sprite because that's how she does things — she arranges. She lines things up for me before she goes. I looked at them sitting there and something behind my ribs contracted, and I had to look away.

She should be here. That was the whole thought. A kid standing in a kitchen at 9:42 in the morning understanding that "should" doesn't mean anything anymore.

Her keys weren't on the hook by the door.

She should have been home by seven. It was 9:42.

I called her. Straight to voicemail. Her voicemail message is the one she recorded four years ago, and she says her name wrong — "You've reached Delia Carver" — except she stumbles on "Carver" because she'd only had the name back for six months after the divorce and it still felt new in her mouth. I've heard this voicemail probably three hundred times. I never mentioned the stumble.

I called again. Voicemail.

I texted: **u ok? still at work?**

I put the phone down and went to the kitchen. Cereal. Frosted Mini-Wheats, same box as last night. I ate standing at the counter because I didn't want to go back to the couch — the couch was where Last Night Nate lived and I needed to be the version of myself who eats breakfast at the counter like a functioning person.

---

The TV was still on from last night, muted. I unmuted it.

Local news, continuous coverage. The morning team looked like they'd been called in early and hadn't had time to do whatever it is anchors do to their faces. Same loop: schools closed, shelter in place, National Guard activated, hospitals on diversion. But the scope had changed overnight. The ticker scrolled cities: New York, London, Tokyo, Mumbai, São Paulo, Lagos, Berlin, Sydney. The news was handling this the way news always handles things it doesn't understand: reporting on how much of it there was instead of what it was.

"The crisis has now been reported in over forty countries." Great. What crisis? "Authorities worldwide are urging calm." Wonderful. Calm about what?

They cut to a reporter standing in front of a hospital in Little Rock. Behind her, the parking lot was full and there were people milling around the entrance in a way that looked wrong but that I couldn't articulate yet. She was saying something about "overwhelmed emergency departments" and "unprecedented patient volume" and then the camera shifted slightly and in the background, behind a parked ambulance, I saw two people standing perfectly still while everyone else moved around them. They were facing the camera. They weren't blinking. The reporter didn't notice them. The camera cut away.

I stood there with my cereal and watched the TV and had the feeling you get when you're playing a game and you've just uncovered a section of the map and the fog of war has pulled back and what's underneath is worse than what you imagined, but also somehow less dramatic — not a massed army, just a landscape that's subtly, fundamentally wrong.

---

From the kitchen window I could see across the gravel drive to the other units. The park was quiet. Not peaceful-quiet — held-breath-quiet. The kind of quiet where the absence of sound is itself a pressure in your ears.

Mr. Pembrook was standing in his lot.

Mr. Pembrook lived three units down, a retired mail carrier, sixty-something, drank Busch Light on his steps and had opinions about the park management that he shared with anyone who came within range. My mom called him "harmless" in a tone that meant she'd considered the alternatives. Every morning he came out in his green terrycloth bathrobe — the one that was missing the belt — to get his mail or just stand there with a cigarette and squint at the sky like he was deciding whether to approve of the weather.

He was wearing the bathrobe now. Nothing else — just the robe, open, no shirt, no undershirt, nothing beneath it. He was standing in the gravel between his trailer and the next one, in the sunniest part of the lot — the one spot where the morning light came between the two units without shadow. I want to be clear about this because it mattered and I noticed: Mr. Pembrook was standing outside in October with his bathrobe hanging open and he was completely exposed, and it was not something he would ever have done — not because he was modest but because Mr. Pembrook was a man with a very specific sense of what was and wasn't acceptable in a public space. Standing naked in the lot was not acceptable. The fact that he was doing it anyway meant that the part of him that knew the difference was gone.

He was just standing there. Not getting his mail. Not smoking. Both hands at his sides. Facing the drive. Not moving. The bathrobe flapped a little in the breeze and he didn't reach for it.

I watched him for maybe a minute, chewing cereal, waiting for him to do something. He didn't do anything. My first thought was that he was sick — whatever was overwhelming the hospital had gotten to Pembrook. Some kind of neurological thing, a fugue state, maybe a stroke. He'd stand there for a while and then he'd snap out of it or collapse, and when the ambulances started running again someone would take him to Johnson Regional and they'd figure out what was wrong. That was the frame I put around it: a sick old man in a bathrobe. Temporary. Fixable.

But there was evidence around him that he'd done something during the night. The spigot on the side of his trailer was dripping — not broken-dripping, turned-on-and-not-quite-closed dripping. There was a wet streak on the gravel below it. And his garbage can, which had been upright by his steps yesterday, was on its side, the bag torn open, contents scattered. It could have been raccoons. We got raccoons sometimes. But the bag wasn't shredded the way raccoons shred things — it was pulled open from the top, the way a person would open it, and some of the contents were missing and others were spread across the gravel as if someone had sorted through them. I noticed this. I didn't understand it yet.

The lot across from his: empty. The Garcias' truck was gone — they'd left, or they were already at work when it started, or something else. Two units down from Pembrook, Mrs. Watts's door was closed, curtains drawn. Sienna Okafor's place, two lots over from ours: porch light on, no movement. The laundry building at the park entrance: door ajar, lights off. Highway 21 beyond it: nothing.

I stood at the window and catalogued all of this without knowing I was cataloguing it. In *Civ*, the beginning of every playthrough is the same: you have one settler, one warrior, and a circle of visible terrain surrounded by fog of war. Everything outside that circle is unknown. The first thing you do — always, before you build, before you commit to anything — is remove the fog. You explore. You figure out what's around you. Because committing before you understand the map is how you lose the game in fifty turns.

I wasn't consciously applying this. I was eating cereal and looking out a window. But part of me was already doing it: noting anomalies, filing them, building a picture from fragments the way I always do when I'm paying attention. The fog was pulling back, and what was underneath was very wrong, and I was the only one looking.

My lower back was killing me. I'd been standing at the window for over an hour, which doesn't sound like much except that I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds and my body is not designed for sustained anything — not standing, not walking, not sitting in one position. I shifted. I leaned against the counter.

I needed to pee but I didn't want to leave the window — leaving meant losing data, and the bathroom has no window, and being in a room where I couldn't see outside had become terrifying. I held it for another twenty minutes and then gave up because biology beats strategy every time. Forty-five seconds in the bathroom and my heart was hammering the whole time. When I got back to the window nothing had changed, but the relief was physical. I hated that I needed a window this much already.

I tried my mom again at 10:15, 10:30, and 10:47. Voicemail, voicemail, voicemail. I texted twice more. I called Johnson Regional main line and got a recording: "Thank you for calling Johnson Regional Medical Center. Due to an unprecedented volume of patients, we are unable to take your call at this time. If this is a life-threatening emergency, please dial 911. Please do not come to the emergency department unless your condition requires immediate medical attention. We appreciate your patience during this difficult time." It was the most polite way I'd ever been told that the hospital was drowning.

I tried the internet again. It was still working — the infrastructure was fine, the cell towers and fiber optics didn't care about behavioral crises — but the content had gotten worse. The Reddit megathread had passed 100,000 comments and fractured into chaos. The useful observations were buried under an avalanche of panic and ideology. A commenter with a medical username had posted a detailed theory about prion disease and gotten two thousand upvotes and a hundred replies explaining why it was wrong. Someone was insisting it was the vaccine. Someone else was insisting it was the people who didn't get the vaccine. A long post about chemtrails had been gilded three times.

Someone had posted cell phone video from what looked like a suburb in Ohio — a woman being slowly surrounded by four people walking toward her in perfect synchronization — and the top comment was "obviously staged."

The news sites were worse. Not because the servers were failing but because the reporters had nothing new to say and were required to keep saying it. CNN had updated its main article six times. Each update was longer and less informative than the last, bulked out with quotes from officials saying "we're monitoring the situation" in increasingly creative ways. The pattern was global: same reports from every continent, same behavioral descriptions, same total absence of explanation. The world's entire information infrastructure was functioning perfectly, and the information it was transmitting was: *We don't know. We don't know. We don't know.*

I am not a person who panics. I want to be clear about this because I think people imagine that when something bad happens, everyone either panics or doesn't, and the people who don't are brave and the people who do are weak. That's not how it works. I didn't panic because panicking wasn't what my body wanted to do. My body wanted to sit and gather information and wait for the picture to clarify, because that's what my body always wants to do. I am built for observation the way some people are built for action. In normal life this looks like laziness. In a crisis it looks like something else.

But I was scared. I was scared the way you get scared when you're watching a loading bar stuck at 83% and you know something's wrong but you can't figure out what. My mom wasn't home. My mom was always home by seven.

And there was the thought I wasn't letting myself think. The one that sat at the edge of every other thought like a shadow you see in peripheral vision and refuse to turn toward. She worked the ER. She was in the building where the "unexplained behavioral episodes" would arrive first, carried in on stretchers, stumbling through the sliding doors. She was in the room where people were afraid, where the adrenaline was highest, where — I didn't have the mechanism yet, but I had the shape of it — whatever was happening to people would happen fastest.

She was probably one of them. The math said so. An ER nurse on the night it started, in the building that was already on diversion before midnight. Probably.

But probably isn't certainly. And I held onto that gap — the space between "probably" and "definitely" — the way you hold onto a ledge when you can feel your fingers slipping. She could have gotten out. She could have locked herself in a supply closet. She was smart and she was calm and she'd spent four years managing emergencies in that building and she knew every exit and every closet and every room with a lock. She could have made it. I didn't believe she had. But I hadn't seen her turn, and until I saw it, the door stayed open. A crack. Enough to breathe through.

I tried her one more time. Voicemail.

At 2:15 my phone buzzed hard — an emergency alert, the kind that overrides Do Not Disturb and makes that sound that always makes me flinch:

**EMERGENCY ALERT: Shelter in place. Lock all doors and windows. Avoid contact with individuals displaying altered behavior. Do NOT approach. Do NOT attempt to restrain.**

I checked the locks. Front door — locked, already locked, Mom always locks it. Back door — locked. The windows were the cheap crank kind that barely sealed when they were closed; I cranked them tight. I closed the blinds in the bedroom and bathroom. In the living room I left them cracked just enough to see the drive.

I sat on the couch. The TV was still running its loop. Mr. Pembrook was still in his lot. The afternoon light was going flat and grey.

Then I noticed something that made my stomach clench. One of the two strangers by the laundry building had drifted closer. Not toward me specifically — toward this end of the park, toward the row of trailers where mine was. And I thought about what I'd been observing all day: how they oriented toward sound, how their heads tracked noise. The TV had been on for hours. It wasn't loud — my mom kept the volume low because the walls are thin and she was considerate about that — but it was the only sound in the park besides the wind and the occasional creak of siding. In this silence, even a low murmur of newscasters carried.

I turned it off. The click of the power button was the loudest thing in the trailer. The screen went dark and the silence rushed in like water filling a hole, and I sat there in the quiet and felt the absence of the one thing that had been connecting me to a world where people still talked and explained and tried to make sense of things. The TV had been a tether. Cutting it was the first time I chose the world outside the window over the world I wanted to still be living in.

The stranger by the laundry building stopped drifting. After a few minutes she turned and walked back toward the entrance. I couldn't prove causation. But I didn't turn the TV on again.

And the trailer was doing the thing again — the wrongness that had nothing to do with the Turned and everything to do with absence. My mom should have been asleep in her bedroom by now, blackout curtains drawn, white noise machine running. Instead: nobody to be quiet for. Her bedroom door was open and the bed was made — she'd made it Friday morning before her shift and no one had touched it since. It looked like a display bed. A bed nobody sleeps in.

I was fifteen years old and alone in a trailer and the world outside was broken and the world inside was empty. Old enough to understand what was happening. Not old enough to do anything about it.

---

The afternoon passed. The TV stopped looping and started getting worse.

By 2 PM the local anchors were gone — replaced by a national feed pulling in footage from everywhere. Most of it was the same: empty streets, Turned standing in clusters, the eerie synchronization of their movements. But some of it was different, and the different stuff was what stuck.

A traffic camera in Houston showed a group of Turned gathered around a fire hydrant that had been knocked open — one of them crouching, face in the stream of water, drinking. Not cupping their hands. Not bending to a fountain. Drinking the way an animal drinks, face-down, sustained. The anchor talked over it without mentioning it, as if the footage was just B-roll and the drinking wasn't the point. A news helicopter in Phoenix filmed what appeared to be Turned inside a grocery store — visible through the shattered front windows, moving between aisles, pulling things off shelves and consuming them standing up. The helicopter footage ran for maybe forty seconds before they cut away to an expert panel that had nothing to say.

I was watching. I was building a picture I didn't want to see. They drank. They ate. They were not statues. They were not frozen. They were something. Organisms. Things with needs. The standing, the stillness, the blank faces — that was their resting state, their default. But they had other states. They got thirsty. They got hungry. They maintained themselves.

Mr. Pembrook had moved. Not far — he'd drifted about ten feet from his previous position and was now closer to the spigot on the side of his trailer. As I watched, he reached out and turned the handle. Water ran. He bent to it, put his mouth to the stream, and drank for about fifteen seconds. Then he turned the handle back — not all the way, leaving it dripping — and returned to his position. The whole sequence was mechanical, purposeful, utterly without the self-consciousness that a human being would bring to the act of drinking from a garden hose in their front yard in an open bathrobe. He needed water. He got water. He went back to waiting.

I'd been telling myself they were deteriorating. Confused, disoriented, running on fumes — they'd wander around for a day or two and then collapse, and the CDC or whoever would come through and clean it up. That was the comfortable version. The version where this was a medical crisis with a timeline and an ending.

The woman eating green tomatoes off the vine killed that version. This was the moment I understood, without having the language for it yet, that these things were not going to just stop. They were not going to stand there until they fell over. They were taking care of themselves, the way any living thing takes care of itself, and whatever was running them had figured out — already, within the first twenty-four hours — how to keep the machinery going.

I ate Frosted Mini-Wheats and monitored the drive through the blinds and thought about this.

At some point in the afternoon I heard more gunshots — closer this time, maybe half a mile, the direction of the subdivisions down toward Highway 64. A burst of rapid handgun fire, then a gap, then two heavier rifle shots, then shouting that I could hear but not understand, and then nothing. The dogs at the far end of the park had been silent all day. They hadn't barked since last night, when they'd all stopped at once. I didn't see any dogs in the park. I didn't see any dogs anywhere. I tried not to think about what that meant.

At 7 PM, with the light almost gone, I checked the news one more time. The FEMA website had posted an updated advisory:

**SHELTER IN PLACE. Lock all doors and windows. Avoid contact with individuals displaying altered behavior. Do NOT approach. Do NOT attempt to restrain. Avoid strenuous physical activity and high-stress situations. Remain calm.**

*Avoid strenuous physical activity and high-stress situations.* I read that three times. Why would FEMA care about your stress level? In a fire you run. In a tornado you take cover. In a flood you get to high ground. Physical activity keeps you alive in every other emergency. Why was this one different?

I didn't figure it out that night. But I remembered it. And remembering it, later, kept me alive.

The movie in my head was still running — the one where you board up, hold out, and the cavalry arrives. But the movie was starting to skip. In the movie, FEMA tells you to shelter in place because help is coming. They don't tell you to manage your stress level. In the movie, the sick people shamble and deteriorate and fall down eventually. They don't eat from gardens and drink from hoses and sort through garbage with the efficiency of someone who plans to be here next week. The movie was wrong. I didn't know how wrong yet.

I ate the leftover pasta cold, standing at the kitchen counter in the dark. My mom's recipe — garlic, tomatoes, the cheap pasta from Dollar General that she insists tastes the same as the expensive kind. She's right. It tasted like Tuesday. Three days ago. A different century.

I washed the fork and put it in the drying rack because that's what she does.
