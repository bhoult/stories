## 2. Sienna Okafor

**Age:** 17
**Height:** Tall (5'8"–5'10")
**Weight:** ~135 lbs (lean, athletic)
**Build:** Lean, muscular. Runner's body — long stride, powerful legs. "The biomechanics of a state-qualifier in the 400-meter."
**Hair:** Black, pulled back in a ponytail
**Skin:** Tan brown. "Bruise on her jaw was a dark purple, vivid against her brown skin."
**Face:** Asian Strong features, expressive
**Clothing:** Track pants, CLARKSVILLE PANTHERS hoodie, canvas sneakers (church donation)
**Distinguishing features:** Moves like an athlete even when standing still. Feet are callused, tough — distance runner's feet. Bruise on jaw (mid-story, from Jim's punch to prevent her turning).
**Personality:** Action-oriented, impatient with inaction. Brave, impulsive, physically fearless. The thing that makes her exceptional (athletic intensity, elevated heart rate) is also the thing that makes the organism most dangerous to her. "Everything I'm good at is trying to kill me." Warm but direct. Reads people faster than Nate reads situations.

## 3. Jim Whittaker — "Preacher Jim"

**Height:** Tall (6'1"–6'3"). "Big man gone thin."

**Build:** Once imposing, now gaunt. Frame suggests he was a powerful man decades ago.
**Hair:** White, cropped military-short
**Skin:** White, weathered
**Face:** Luminous eyes. "The steady, luminous look." Red-rimmed from exhaustion by late story.
**Clothing:** Flannel shirt, khakis
**Health:** Bad heart. Takes metoprolol (beta-blocker). In visible decline by campus chapters — heavier breathing, hand always finding door frames and chair backs for balance. "His color was off."
**Distinguishing features:** Vietnam veteran bearing beneath the pastor's gentleness. Hums a tuneless melody while walking. Makes coffee as ritual. Has prophetic dreams he doesn't explain.
**Personality:** Faithful, calm, diplomatic. Holds both faith and pharmacology without contradiction. Patient, wise, protective. Tells stories as gifts. Never raises his voice. Punches Sienna in the jaw when necessary to save her life, then prays about it. Dying slowly and pretending he isn't.

## 4. Marcus Webb

**Age:** 42
**Height:** 6'0"–6'2"
**Weight:** ~220 lbs (large, physically imposing)

**Hair:** Not specified — assume dark, short
**Skin:** White, weathered/road-worn
**Face:** "Flat, weathered expression he wore for everything." Doesn't show emotion on his face; shows it in his body (goes rigid).
**Clothing:** Jacket, trucker wear. Practical, worn.
**Equipment:** Dented stainless steel flask (early — stops drinking mid-story), CB radio (Cobra 29), wrench and tools (late story)
**Distinguishing features:** Carries a phone in his pocket — dead for weeks, then charged at the university. Lock screen: daughter Ava, age 9, purple birthday frosting on her face. Hands always working on something.
**Personality:** Calm from depression rather than training. Observant, practical. Knows every road within 300 miles. Recovering alcoholic — the anxiolytics bridged the withdrawal, and now the wrench and truck replaced the bottle. Quiet grief for his daughter in Tulsa. "Logistical brilliance" directed at the wrong compass point — every mile north is a mile from Ava. Picks Nate up and carries him when Nate breaks down, because that's what Marcus does.

## 5. Ruth Fenn

**Skin:** White, aged
**Face:** Fine tremor in hands, controlled by discipline. Sharp eyes.
**Clothing:** Cardigan over floral blouse. Proper dress — maintains appearance standards even post-apocalypse.
**Health:** Takes atenolol (beta-blocker). Knees are the group's pace-limiting factor on the trail. Cannot sprint.
**Distinguishing features:** Corrects grammar constantly. Reads romance novels and her Bible. Carries medical knowledge inherited from her late husband Leonard (plumber who died 2019).
**Personality:** Sharp-tongued, authoritative, no-nonsense. "I taught for thirty-nine years." Uses humor and control as armor. Afraid but hides it with discipline. The group's moral compass — they move at her pace because leaving people behind means they've already lost. Catalogues library books at the university and notes grammar errors in biology textbooks.

## 6. Dale Soto

**Age:** 40s–50s
**Height:** 5'10" (average)

**Hair:** Not specified
**Skin:** Not specified
**Face:** Quiet, watchful expression
**Clothing:** Casual, practical
**Equipment:** Carving knife, blocks of wood. Always carving — a beagle, a cardinal, a turtle, a pill bottle. Each one a meditation.
**Health:** Recovering from opioid use disorder (6 years of addiction). Was on Suboxone maintenance — ran out on the trail. Withdrawal hit hard: sweating, cramping, nausea, heart rate at 94. Survived with propranolol and clonazepam bridge. Three weeks clean by campus.
**Distinguishing features:** Hands. They tell his whole story — tremoring during withdrawal, then gradually steadying, then completely still. "His hands were steady. They'd been steady for days now." Carves at 2 AM when the dreams come.
**Personality:** Quiet, introspective, creative. Carries deep guilt about his daughter in Fayetteville (hasn't spoken to her in 2 years). Honest about his vulnerabilities. Uses carving as emotional regulation. "In recovery, they say 'the only way out is through.' Turns out it's just accurate."

**Personality:** Practical, calculating, organized. Office manager for a law firm with 11 attorneys for 9 years — that's her superpower. Not cold, but disciplined. Sees resources as line items. "I'm not saying don't help people. I'm saying know the cost." The person who tells you how many days of food you have left. Empathetic but refuses to let empathy override arithmetic.

## 8. Dr. Eleanor Moss

**Age:** ~30 ("Young, maybe thirty")
**Height:** Average
**Weight:** Thin. "Thin in the way of someone who'd been too focused to eat properly for weeks."
**Build:** Slight, underfed
**Hair:** Short, black
**Skin:** Not specified
**Eyes:** Sharp, tired. Glasses.

**Clothing:** Lab coat over flannel shirt and jeans
**Equipment:** Whiteboard, dry-erase markers, laboratory equipment, frequency emitter, broadcast transmitter
**Distinguishing features:** The squint. Never quite relaxes her face. Draws diagrams constantly. Speaks in precise, careful sentences — a scientist who chooses every word.
**Personality:** Brilliant, focused, exhausted. Research biologist who has been alone (with Howard and grad students) studying the organism for six weeks. Correct about the organism's biology — except for one crucial thing: she says it's not intelligent, just emergent complexity. She's right at rooted scale. She'll be proven wrong at colony scale. "The hardest thing a scientist can do" — revise her model.

## 9. Caleb Reeves

**Age:** 7
**Height:** Small (average for 7)
**Weight:** Small child's build
**Build:** Small, slight
**Hair:** Dark
**Skin:** Light
**Clothing:** Found in pajamas and one shoe. Later: whatever donated children's clothes are available.
**Equipment:** Crayons, paper (draws dinosaurs). Wooden beagle carved by Dale.
**Distinguishing features:** Asks questions about everything — why trees lose leaves, why creek water is brown, why rocks have stripes. Cries in his sleep with "small, hitching sounds" and doesn't remember in the morning.
**Personality:** Remarkably okay. "Not undamaged — not unaffected — but okay in the way that children are okay when the adults around them are steady enough to build a floor." Orphaned (parents turned Day 2), survived alone for days under his bed. Attaches to the group as a whole rather than any single person. Draws dinosaurs because dinosaurs are safe and knowable and extinct, which means they can't hurt you.

## 10. Delia Carver — Nate's Mother

**Age:** 40s
**Height:** Average
**Weight:** Average
**Build:** Working nurse's build — on her feet for 12-hour shifts

**Skin:** White
**Clothing:** Sheriff's department jacket (worn as authority symbol, no longer official)
**Equipment:** Rifles, shotguns, bullhorn, generator, plywood fortifications, American flag (oversized, car-dealership style)
**Distinguishing features:** The bullhorn. Uses it to broadcast authority. The flag. The generator humming. Everything about his defense strategy is loud, visible, and wrong.
**Personality:** Competent, confident, authority-driven. 20 years as sheriff's deputy. Not stupid — wrong. Refuses to hear that his competence is the problem. "I know how crowds behave." He doesn't. These aren't crowds. His house falls in a swarm frenzy. The flag ends up in the mud.
**Status:** Turned or dead when his house falls.

**Height:** Average

**Face:** "Grin — too wide. It involved too many muscles, pulled back too far, showing too many teeth."
**Distinguishing features:** First Turned Nate observes in detail. Stands motionless in the trailer park lot for 20+ hours. Nate's mother called him "harmless." He drank Busch Light on his steps and squinted at the sky in judgment.
