# Chapter 4: The Knock

I spent the afternoon reading my mom's nursing textbook.

My mom kept two textbooks from her associate's degree on a shelf above the washer-dryer unit: *Fundamentals of Nursing* and *Brunner & Suddarth's Medical-Surgical Nursing*, which is the size and weight of a cinder block. She'd never gotten rid of them because, she said, "Nursing school was the hardest thing I ever did and those books are my trophies." I'd never opened them.

By Day 2 my phone was dead, the laptop was dead, the TV was off, I'd read every magazine in the house, and the textbooks were there. I pulled *Brunner & Suddarth* off the shelf and started reading about the autonomic nervous system because the alternative was sitting in the dark replaying the sound of Lisa Anderson screaming.

I didn't understand half of it. I understood enough. The sympathetic nervous system ran on chemicals: epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol. Produced by the adrenal glands in response to perceived threat. The system was involuntary — you didn't choose to activate it any more than you chose to digest food. I read about beta-blockers. I read about the feedback loop between the amygdala and the hypothalamus — the cycle where fear triggers chemicals that trigger more fear.

That night I learned the worst thing about them.

It was dark. I was in the hallway with *Brunner & Suddarth* open on the floor beside me and a flashlight I wasn't using because light is visible through thin walls.

The knock came at 10:47 PM. Three knocks. Front door. Polite.

"Nate? Honey? Your mama asked me to check on you."

Lisa Anderson's exact voice — the nasal quality, the stretched vowel in "mama." I had watched her turn six hours ago. Whatever was on the porch was using her voice the way you'd use a key against a lock.

"Nate, are you in there? I brought you some dinner."

Lisa knew my mom worked at the hospital. Lisa had actually brought us food before. The organism had access to her memories and was rummaging through them like a drawer full of keys, trying each one, not understanding which lock it was standing in front of. It happened to pull two that fit — checking on the neighbor's kid, bringing food. Familiar voices activate the brain's reward pathways before the cortex can evaluate them. It wasn't trying to fool my thinking brain. It was reaching for the layer underneath.

Knowing this did not help.

Then it stopped. Ten seconds of silence.

When it came back, it wasn't Lisa's anymore.

"Nate? Baby? It's Mom. I'm home."

I put my hand over my mouth and bit down hard enough to leave marks. The sound trying to come out of me would have carried through the walls.

"I got off early. The roads were bad but I made it. Open the door, bud."

It was perfect. The warmth. The tiredness underneath. The pause before "bud."

"I brought Chick-fil-A. Come on, open up."

She doesn't bring Chick-fil-A. She brings Whataburger. Mom turns left out of the Johnson Regional Medical Center parking lot, passes the Taco Bell, and a mile down hits the Whataburger. Patty melt with jalapeños and a Dr Pepper. Every time. The closest Chick-fil-A is twenty-five minutes away in Russellville — Lisa Anderson's commute, not Mom's. Lisa drove to Russellville for work. The organism was using Lisa's neural architecture to puppet Mom's voice, and Lisa's brain associated "bringing dinner home" with the Chick-fil-A she passed every day on 64. The organism didn't know the difference. It grabbed the strongest food-plus-homecoming association it could find and it grabbed the wrong woman's.

The only reason I didn't open the door was a fast food restaurant. The margin between surviving and not was the difference between a Whataburger and a Chick-fil-A. I am alive because an alien organism used the wrong woman's memory of a drive-through.

"Happy Friday, bud."

Her exact voice. The inflection that rises on "Friday" and falls on "bud." I cried without making a sound. The thing on the porch said it again — "Happy Friday, bud" — and again — like a record skipping. It didn't understand that the reason the key fit was the same reason the door would never open.

Then Lisa's voice came back — the same warm tone, the same cadence, but the words were wrong.

"Honey, did you remember to call Dr. Patel about the referral?"

It said it exactly the way you'd say it standing in a kitchen doorway, car keys still in your hand, picking up a conversation from that morning. Lisa's voice. Lisa's inflection. But it wasn't for me. It was for her husband. It was a sentence from a Tuesday in September, or a Thursday in August — some ordinary night when Lisa came home and asked about something that mattered to their life and nobody else's. The organism had reached into the drawer again and grabbed something that felt like *coming home and talking to someone on the other side of a door*, and it didn't know the difference between a husband and a fifteen-year-old stranger.

"The co-pay's going to be ridiculous if he's out of network."

I almost laughed. The worst night of my life (so far), a dead woman's voice on my porch, and the organism was worried about insurance co-pays. It kept going — same tone, same warmth, each sentence a perfect little fossil of a life that didn't exist anymore, delivered to a door that had nothing to do with any of it.

Forty-five minutes. 10:47 to 11:32.

I sat for another hour. Then I washed my hand. The bite was deep — human mouths are bacterial ecosystems, infection rate above 10%. *Brunner & Suddarth*, chapter on wound management. My mom would have cleaned it properly. She would have said "Nate, honestly" in that exasperated voice, and fixed it.

I wrote in the notebook:

*She used Mom's voice. They access memories. The mimicry isn't targeted — it's a handful of keys thrown at a lock. Some fit. Most don't. The insurance co-pay didn't fit. "Happy Friday, bud" fit so well it almost killed me. They find the thing you miss most by accident, mixed in with someone else's grocery list and dental appointments, and they put it on the other side of a door.*

*I miss her so much I can't breathe and the thing that used her voice knows that.*

I did not sleep. My brain had the Knock on a loop and the loop had no off switch. Forty-five minutes of audio playing behind my eyes every time I closed them. Lisa's voice. Then Mom's voice. "Happy Friday, bud." Over and over. I tried to think about something else and my mind returned to the loop the way a compass needle returns to north.

Around 3 AM I realized the loop itself was dangerous. Each replay spiked cortisol — chronic stress activation. The organism didn't need to scare me all at once. It could do it in installments. The Knock wasn't just an attempt to get me to open the door. It was a seed planted in a brain that couldn't stop replaying. My brain was doing its work for it, for free, in the dark.

I pressed my palms against my eyes and counted backward from a hundred by sevens. A cognitive interrupt — the kind of task that forces the prefrontal cortex to override the amygdala. It worked, partly. The loop dimmed to background noise. It didn't stop.
