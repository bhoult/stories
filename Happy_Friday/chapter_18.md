# Chapter 18: The Map

## ACT THREE: THE WALK
### *"The hardest thing I've ever done was go slow."*

---

Marcus spread a road map on the church floor.

An actual paper map — an Arkansas Department of Transportation fold-out from 2019, retrieved from the glove box of his truck two blocks east. The internet was a memory. GPS was a memory. The satellites were still up there, orbiting a planet that had stopped listening, but the map on the floor was the most advanced navigation technology we had.

Marcus knelt over it with a carpenter's pencil, tracing routes. I knelt across from him with the notebook. Sienna stood behind me, looking over my shoulder, close enough that I could feel the warmth of her. I ignored this. The lying was functional.

"Here's us." Marcus put a dot on the map — the Arkansas River valley, south of the Boston Mountains, in the stretch of lowland between the river and the first ridgeline. "Here's Fayetteville." Another dot, northwest, on the far side of a dense contour cluster that represented the mountains. "Sixty miles as the crow flies. Except we're not crows. We're eight people, one of whom is seventy-two, one of whom is seven, and one of whom —" He looked at me. "Gets winded on stairs."

"I'm aware."

"Just making sure it's in the model." He turned back to the map. "The obvious route is I-40 west to Alma, then 71 north. Highway the whole way. Flat-ish. Fast."

"And impossible," I said.

"And impossible. Every highway interchange is a congregation point. I-40 funnels through the river valley like a cattle chute — the terrain pinches the road between the river and the bluffs, and every pinch point is a truck stop or a rest area or a gas station, and every one of those is a concentration of Turned. I drove through it three weeks ago and it was already bad. It'll be worse now."

"Back roads?"

"Better. But back roads connect to highways, and the connection points are where it gets bad. Also — vehicles."

"No vehicles," Sienna said. She'd heard Marcus's argument before, in the basement, but she repeated it for the room. "A car engine is the loudest thing in a silent world. Start a truck and every Turned in a half-mile knows where you are."

"Could we push a vehicle?" Dale asked. He was standing by the stairs, empty-handed — he'd left the knife and wood with Caleb. His hands kept flexing.

"Downhill, maybe, for short stretches. But the terrain between here and Fayetteville doesn't do 'short downhill stretches.' It does ravines and ridgelines and creek crossings that would stop a tank." Marcus traced a line on the map, north from our position, into the contour cluster. "The Ozark Highlands Trail."

Sienna went still.

"My dad hiked sections of it," she said. Quiet. The sentence had weight — her father, the man who'd driven to Oklahoma City to get Jaylen and hadn't come back. "He was a section hiker. He'd do weekends, ten or fifteen miles at a time. He took me once. I was twelve."

"What do you remember?"

"Ridgelines. The trail follows the ridgelines mostly — up and down, up and down, but the path stays high. Oak forest. Sandstone bluffs. You can see forever from the top." She paused. "I remember my dad saying the nearest road was sometimes ten miles away. That was the point. He went to get away from roads."

Marcus nodded. "The OHT runs through the Ozark National Forest. I've crossed it hauling timber loads — the forest service roads intersect the trail every ten, fifteen miles. Once you're up in the mountains, there's nothing. No population. No highways. No towns. The Turned congregate where people were. People weren't in the deep woods."

I looked at the map. The contour lines in the Boston Mountains were dense — tight switchbacks of elevation, creek drainages cutting deep V-shapes into the ridgelines. The OHT was marked as a thin dashed line, barely visible, threading along the ridge tops like a crack in a wall.

"It solves three problems," I said. "Population density — zero in the forest. Terrain advantage — the Turned's coordination is optimized for open ground and built environments. Dense forest with ravines disrupts the signal. And navigation — the trail is blazed. White aluminum markers on trees. We don't need a GPS. We need eyes."

"And it creates three problems," Marcus said. He wasn't arguing against it. He was completing the analysis. "Physical difficulty — the OHT gains and loses thousands of feet of elevation. Ruth can barely do a flat mile. Caleb is seven. You —"

"Get winded on stairs. You've mentioned."

"— will struggle. Second: exposure. It's November. The Ozarks in November mean cold nights, frost, possible ice. We have no tents. Limited clothing. A seven-year-old in pajamas." He looked at Caleb's sleeping form on the pew, visible through the stairwell. "Third: isolation. If something goes wrong on a ridgeline twenty miles from the nearest road, there's no help. No pharmacy. No shelter. Just forest."

"The alternative is staying here and watching the clocks run out."

"I know. I'm not arguing. I'm listing the ways we could die so we can plan around them."

---

The planning took three days. In those three days, the Turned count near the church went from twenty-three to twenty-six. The clock was audible.

**Day one: route.** Marcus and I disagreed.

I wanted the shortest path — pick up the trail at the nearest access point, a forest service road eight miles south, and take the most direct line northwest to Fayetteville. Shortest distance, fastest timeline. I had the map. I'd calculated mileage. I was certain.

Marcus looked at my route and said: "That section drops into Hurricane Creek valley. I've hauled loads on the roads above it. The drainage is tight, the hollows are deep, and if there's a herd in that creek bottom, you've got cliff on one side and water on the other and nowhere to climb."

"The map doesn't show any population in that valley."

"The map doesn't show a lot of things. The creek crossings flood in October — I've seen the water marks on the bridges, three feet above the road. The ridgeline above Hare Mountain is exposed for two miles with no tree cover. And every trailhead parking area is exactly the kind of place people would have fled to when the roads failed — a dead-end in the woods where you could hide your car. Those parking areas are going to be occupied."

"You don't know that."

"I know what panicked people do when they're running out of highway. I've been watching them do it for fifteen years. They take the exit. They follow the road to where it ends. They park and they wait. And now they're Turned and they're standing in a trailhead parking lot and your 'shortest path' walks right through them."

We argued. I argued with data — "the map contours suggest the drainage is seasonal, Marcus, the elevation profile clearly shows —" and Marcus argued with experience. He waited until I'd finished mapping a creek bed I'd never seen, then said, "Have you ever been to a creek?"

"I've seen maps of creeks."

He stared at me. The stare lasted long enough that I heard how that sounded.

The argument was the first real authority clash in the group — the kid with the map versus the man who'd driven the roads — and it ended the way it had to end: I conceded. Not because Marcus pulled rank. Because he was right, and being right was more important than being in charge. Though I want the record to show that the elevation profile *did* clearly show what I said it showed. The elevation profile just turned out to be irrelevant. This is a distinction I cared about at the time and that nobody else cared about at all.

Marcus's route was longer — an extra day, maybe two, approaching from the south on higher ground, avoiding the creek bottoms, staying on ridgelines with sightlines. Less efficient. More survivable.

"A map is a picture of a place," Marcus said. "It is not the place."

I wrote this in the notebook and underlined it.

**Day two: supplies.** Marcus proposed the truck.

"Atwoods is south of town," he said, tracing the route on the map we'd taped to the sanctuary wall. "Three miles down the highway. We drive there, we pull every Turned between here and the store toward the south end of town. By the time we leave tomorrow morning, the north side — our exit route — should be cleaner."

It was the first time anyone had proposed using the engine noise as a weapon instead of a liability. The truck drew Turned — we'd known this since Day 1. But drawing them *away*, pulling them south toward the highway while the church sat north, that was Marcus thinking like a driver. You don't just haul a load. You read the road ahead.

"We need everyone who can carry," Maria said, already working the logistics. "We can't haul everything in one truck run if we're parking at a distance. Everyone goes except Ruth, Jim, and Caleb."

Six of us went. Marcus drove. Maria rode shotgun with her list. Sienna, Dale, and I sat in the truck bed with the tailgate down. As the truck pulled onto Highway 21, I watched the Turned in the church parking lot — the half-dozen that had been orbiting our sanctuary for three weeks — pivot toward the sound. Head-turns. The slow gravitational drift. Then, as the truck moved south, they followed. Not fast. But south, toward the highway, away from the church. That was the point.

Marcus parked a quarter mile from Atwoods — close enough to walk, far enough that the sound would draw Turned to the truck rather than the store. He left the engine running. He put a CD in — one of Ruth's husband Gerald's old Merle Haggard albums that had been sitting in the glove box since before the world ended — and turned the volume up. Merle Haggard singing "Mama Tried" to an empty highway, the speakers buzzing, the engine idling underneath. A beacon of noise. Everything within a quarter mile would drift toward it.

"Move," Marcus said.

Atwoods was a farm and ranch supply — the kind of place that sold feed corn and fence posts and hunting rifles and had a camping section in the back that smelled like canvas and rubber. Marcus had been there a hundred times hauling shelving. He knew the layout.

"Walmart's picked clean," he'd said the night before. "Two weeks of panic buying and then the Turned moved in. Atwoods is different. People raided the food and the guns. Nobody thought to grab sleeping bags."

He was right. The front windows were broken but the store was largely intact. The gun cases were empty, glass shattered, every rifle and shotgun gone in the first week. The ammunition shelves were bare. But the camping aisle was almost untouched. In the logic of panic, people had grabbed weapons and food and left behind the things that would actually keep them alive in the woods.

We moved fast. Maria had her list, written on the back of a church bulletin. Backpacks — real hiking packs with internal frames and hip belts, not the canvas military surplus we'd been planning on. Eight of them, sized as close as we could manage. Sleeping bags rated to twenty degrees. Tarps — lightweight, waterproof, the kind hunters used for ground blinds. Sleeping pads, the thin foam rolls that wouldn't do much but would keep you off the cold ground. A water filter and purification tablets. Two camp stoves and fuel canisters. A cooking pot and a skillet. Headlamps with extra batteries. Fire starters. First aid kits. Paracord. Duct tape.

Marcus lingered in the hunting section. The gun cases were empty but the archery wall still had stock — compound bows too complex for panicked looters to figure out, and three crossbows in their boxes. He took a crossbow, a case of bolts, and a sharpening kit. "Quieter than a gun," he said. "And bolts are reusable." He also grabbed hatchets — small ones, the kind you'd use to split kindling — and a hunting knife for everyone. Eight blades. We weren't going into the mountains unarmed.

In the camping food aisle, we loaded freeze-dried meals. Mountain House, Backpacker's Pantry — the kind of food that weighed nothing and lasted forever and tasted like salted cardboard and would keep you walking. We took everything on the shelf. We also took energy bars, trail mix, instant oatmeal, powdered drink mixes. Calories that were light enough to carry and dense enough to matter.

We loaded up — six people carrying what we'd normally throw in a truck bed. Packs on our backs, sleeping bags under arms, the freeze-dried meals distributed between us in plastic bags. The crossbow across Marcus's shoulders. The hatchets clinking in Dale's pack. Three miles back to the church, on foot, loaded like mules.

We could hear the truck before we saw it. Merle Haggard was still playing — "Silver Wings," now — but the sound was different, muffled, coming through bodies. The Turned had found it. A dozen of them, maybe fifteen, clustered around the truck in the slow gravitational drift, drawn to the engine and the music, standing in the road with their heads tilted toward the speakers. Some were touching the truck — hands on the hood, on the fenders, the patient, purposeless contact of organisms drawn to vibration. The truck had done its job. It had pulled them south, away from the church, and now they stood around it like congregants at a service none of them understood.

Marcus looked at the cluster. "Leave it," he said. "We go around."

We gave the truck a wide berth — two hundred yards east, cutting through a strip mall parking lot, moving fast and quiet with our loads. The Turned at the truck didn't notice us. They were focused on the music, on the engine, on whatever residual pattern the sound activated in whatever was left of their brains. Merle Haggard singing about silver wings to an audience that would never leave.

The route east took us past the hospital. I hadn't been thinking about it — hadn't let myself think about it, the way you don't let yourself look at the sun. But the hospital was only six blocks east of the highway, and as we cut through the parking lot of a shuttered insurance office, the hospital's lot was visible across the road, and the cluster of Turned in the lot was visible from there, and among them — in blue scrubs, in the ponytail she wore for night shifts, standing in the November sun with bare feet and nothing behind her eyes — was my mother.

I stopped walking.

Marcus saw what I was looking at. He put his hand on my shoulder — firm, the grip of a man who understood that the next ten seconds mattered. "I see her," he said, quietly. "Keep moving."

"That's my mom."

"I know. Keep moving, Nate."

The group kept walking. I kept walking. My legs moved because Marcus's hand was on my shoulder and the group was moving and stopping would mean looking and looking would mean — I kept walking. But I saw her. She was standing near the ambulance bay with maybe fifteen other Turned — former staff, still gravitating to the place where they'd worked. Her hands were at her sides. Her face was tilted toward the sun. The smile. The vacant, patient, terrible smile.

I'd known since Day 1. Night shift, first night, a hospital filling with panicking patients and panicking staff. She never had a chance. I'd carried this the way you carry a sealed envelope — knowing what's inside, not opening it, because at least the envelope is containable.

The envelope was open now. The contents were a woman in blue scrubs who had said "Happy Friday, bud" three hundred times and who brought home Whataburger after every shift and who kept two nursing textbooks on a shelf like trophies and who had taught me by accident everything I needed to survive. She was standing in a parking lot with bare feet and the organism had taken everything that made her my mother and replaced it with the smile.

We walked. The hospital fell behind us. My hands were shaking on the pack straps — not the adrenaline shake, not the threshold shake, the grief shake, the one that comes from holding something sealed for twenty-three days and watching it crack open on a sidewalk at walking pace with fifty pounds of camping gear on your back.

Nobody else had seen her. Marcus had. He walked beside me and said nothing, which was the right thing.

The shaking stopped. Something harder replaced the grief. Something dense, with edges. The grief was an open wound. This was the wound closing around a piece of metal.

I was angry.

Cold. Structural. The anger of a machine recalibrating. The organism had taken my mother. The organism operated through fear — human fear, human biology, the panic response that turned hospitals into conversion factories and neighborhoods into herds. The organism hadn't chosen my mother specifically. It had built a system where a night-shift nurse in a hospital full of terrified patients had zero chance of survival. The system had worked exactly as designed, and my mother was standing in a parking lot with bare feet because she had been inside it when it activated.

I wanted to burn the parking lot. I wanted to burn the hospital. I wanted to walk back there and — what? What would I do? Hit them? They were Turned. They didn't feel it. Scream at them? They'd smile. The anger had no target it could reach and no action it could take and it sat in my chest like a hot coal with nowhere to go.

And underneath — something less rational, something I recognized as unfair even as I felt it. Anger at the Turned themselves. At the fifteen people standing in that parking lot who had been nurses and orderlies and patients and who had *let the fear take them.* I knew — I knew with the analytical part of my brain, the part that had read the textbook — that they hadn't chosen it. That the conversion mechanism was biological, involuntary, a cascade of neurochemical responses that no amount of willpower could override once the threshold was crossed. I knew this. The anger didn't care. The anger said: they panicked. They let the fear win. Their fear fed the cascade that took her. Their weakness killed my mother.

It was not rational. It was not fair. I did not care.

And deeper — anger at myself. I'd known since Day 1. I'd done the math. Night shift, first night, a hospital. I'd known and I'd sealed it in an envelope and I'd sat in a church basement writing in a notebook while she stood in a parking lot with bare feet. I was too slow. Too comfortable. Too willing to sit at a window and calculate instead of act. If I'd been faster — if I'd been someone other than a fat fifteen-year-old who got winded on stairs — would it have mattered? Probably not. The math said no. But the anger said *you didn't even try.*

We walked the three miles back to the church. I carried two packs — mine and one of the extras — and the sleeping bags and the hatchets and the weight of what I'd seen. None of it was as heavy as it should have been. The anger was doing something unexpected — it was making the weight lighter. Every step, the anger lifted with me. Not grief. Grief makes you heavy. Anger makes you fast. I noticed this, the way the anger functioned as fuel, and the noticing disturbed me, and I took the next step anyway.

I didn't tell anyone what I'd seen or felt. Grief I could have shared — grief has a script, people know what to say. But this anger had no script. I carried it the way I carried everything: sealed, sorted, filed.

---

Maria took command of the packing.

In twenty-two days she'd turned the church's pantry from a disorganized food bank closet into a precision logistics operation. Now she applied the same ruthless accounting to the Atwoods haul. She laid everything out on the sanctuary floor — eight packs, eight sleeping bags, the tarps, the pads, the stoves, the food, the blades — and counted and weighed and organized. Every ounce miscalculated had a human cost.

Calories per person per day: 1,800 minimum, 2,400 for the walking pace we'd need. Weight per person: fifteen pounds maximum for Jim and Ruth, twenty for Marcus and Sienna, ten for Caleb, who would carry nothing because he was seven and would need to be carried himself when the trail got steep.

I would carry twenty-five. Maria decided this without consulting me.

"You're the heaviest and the youngest besides Caleb. You carry the most."

"I'm the one with the worst cardio."

"Then improve your cardio. You have two days." She handed me a pack — one of the Atwoods hiking packs, green, with a frame that dug into my lower back before I'd even loaded it. "Start walking laps around the church yard. Now."

I walked laps. Sienna walked with me. We walked in loops around the church, the gravel crunching under our shoes — the truck had drawn most of the Turned south, but a few had drifted back, two or three in the parking lot tracking us with their slow head-turns — and we walked and walked and Sienna set the pace and I matched it and my lungs burned and my legs ached and she didn't slow down and I didn't ask her to because asking would have meant admitting I couldn't keep up and admitting I couldn't keep up would have meant — well. I didn't want to admit it. Not to her.

Sienna thought I was sulking. I could feel it in the way she kept glancing at me — the sidelong assessment, the small frown, the expression of a girl who'd seen me retreat into my own head before and was calibrating whether to push or wait. She'd seen the version of me that withdrew. The quiet, passive version that sat at a window and watched. She was looking at me and seeing that version, the one she'd spent three weeks learning to identify.

She was wrong. I wasn't withdrawing. I was burning. The anger from the hospital parking lot was still in my chest, hot and dense, and the walking wasn't making it smaller — the walking was feeding it, because the walking hurt, and the pain felt earned. My lungs burning and my legs aching and the Turned in the parking lot tracking us with their slow head-turns — the smiles, always the smiles — and every smile was the smile in the hospital parking lot, the one on my mother's face, and the anger flared at each one like a match touched to gasoline.

On the sixth lap, the impulse to stop hit me like a wall. Not pain — laziness. The specific, philosophical laziness that says *this is enough, you've proven the point, sit down.* The belief that the world owed me the right to quit when I was tired. I recognized it the way you recognize your own handwriting — familiar, personal, mine. I'd been carrying this particular lie my whole life, the one that said effort had a reasonable limit and I'd reached it and anything beyond was someone else's job. In the old world, that lie had cost me grades and friendships and the respect of people who'd tried to push me. In this world, it would cost me my legs on day three of the trail and everyone else's survival along with them.

I didn't stop. Not because I overcame the laziness — not because Sienna was watching — because the anger wouldn't let me. The anger said: *you don't get to stop. You sat at a window. You sat in a church basement. You sat while she stood in a parking lot with bare feet. You don't get to sit anymore.* The pain in my legs was something I owed. The burning in my lungs was a debt. Mercy for myself was the same weakness that had kept me at the window on Day 1, and mercy for myself was over.

"You're doing fine," she said, on the fourth lap.

"I'm dying."

"You're not dying. I've seen dying. You're just out of shape."

"Is this your version of encouragement?"

"My version of encouragement involves a stopwatch and a coach screaming at you from the infield. This is gentle."

We walked another lap. The Turned tracked us. The gravel crunched. My breathing was loud enough to qualify as a broadcast.

"Nate."

"Yeah."

"The Lyles are dead."

I didn't say anything.

"Three people are dead. You saw it coming. You told Craig. He didn't listen. And right now, in your head, you're building the version where that's not your fault. Because you warned him. Because he had a gun and you had a notebook. Because you're fifteen and you're fat and what were you supposed to do — you did everything you could. Right?"

"I did do what I could."

"No. You did everything you were *comfortable* doing. You walked over there once, said your piece, and walked back. When he didn't listen, you filed it under 'not my problem' because you'd already decided you weren't the kind of person who could make someone listen. You decided that before you walked over there. You decided it before you decided to go. You decided it on Day One, when you sat at your window and watched Lisa Anderson get taken and said 'I'm fifteen and I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds' like those numbers were a verdict instead of a starting point."

I stopped walking. She stopped with me.  She didn't know I had already given myself this talk.

"I couldn't save Lisa Anderson." It came out of me automatically, an old habit. I hated it.

"Maybe not. But you could have done something you hadn't already decided was impossible. You could have banged on the window. You could have thrown something. You could have screamed — not to save her, maybe, but to try, so that the trying was on the record, so that the next time you looked in the mirror you'd see a person who tried and failed instead of a person who calculated that trying wasn't worth it." She was breathing hard too — not from the walking, from the saying. "You keep using your body as an excuse. 'I can't run. I'm out of shape. I get winded on stairs.' But you also figured out the fear mechanism. You also read the textbook. You also walked to the Lyles' house and back through nine Turned. Your body does things, Nate. You just won't take credit for them because taking credit means taking responsibility, and taking responsibility means the next failure is *yours*."

"It was mine. The Lyles —"

"Yes. It was yours. And mine. And Jim's. And everyone's who saw what was coming and accepted Craig's 'no' like it was the end of the conversation." She looked at me and her eyes were fierce and wet at the same time. "In the best case scenario, Nate — the absolute best case — everything that goes wrong is your fault. Because if it's your fault, that means you had the power to prevent it, which means you have the power to do better next time. If nothing is your fault — if you're just a fat fifteen-year-old kid who can't run and can't help and can't change anything — then you're powerless. And you're not powerless. You're the person who figured out what's happening when the entire rest of the world couldn't. So stop building the case for why you can't do things and start building plans for how to do them better."

The Turned in the parking lot swayed. A bird — an actual bird, a real one, alive — crossed the parking lot and landed on the church sign. We stood in the gravel and my lungs burned and my legs ached and the thing Sienna had just said was sitting in my chest like a stone, heavy and cold and true.

But true in a way she didn't intend. She meant: *be brave. Try harder. Take responsibility.* She was talking to the passive boy who watched from windows and decided the odds weren't worth it. She was right about that boy. But the boy standing next to her was holding an anger she couldn't see, and her words were landing in it like stones in a furnace.

*Stop building the case for why you can't do things.* Yes. Stop being weak. Stop flinching. The Turned want to eat you, and what was human in them is gone, and mercy is the comfortable lie, and the comfortable lie will get you killed.

*You sat at your window and watched Lisa Anderson get taken.* Yes. I sat. I calculated. I was too slow, too soft, too willing to be comfortable while the world burned. I deserved the pain in my legs and the burning in my lungs and the chafing and the exhaustion because the pain was what I'd earned by being the version of myself that sat and watched.

She didn't know what she was feeding. She thought she was lighting a fire under a passive kid. She was pouring accelerant on a blaze she couldn't see.

"The old world could afford what you're doing," she said, quieter now. "The comfortable lies. The *I'm not that kind of person* excuse. The old world had margins — room for people to hide inside their own limitations and still survive. This world consumes people who don't adapt. You know this. You wrote it in the notebook. You just haven't applied it to yourself."

*This world consumes people who don't adapt.* The Turned in the parking lot, smiling. The fifteen people in the hospital parking lot, smiling. My mother. They hadn't adapted. They'd panicked — let the fear take them — and the world had consumed them. Sienna meant something humane by "adapt." She meant: grow, push yourself, become who you need to be. But the anger heard something else. The anger heard: *what was human is gone. The ones who couldn't adapt are gone. Mercy is what the old world could afford. This world can't.*

I started walking again. She walked with me. The next lap was faster. The pace was punishment and the punishment was fuel and the fuel made me faster and the faster I walked the more my legs burned and the more my legs burned the less I thought about the parking lot and the less I thought about the parking lot the angrier I got that the only way to stop thinking about it was pain.

I laughed. It was the second laugh since before the Turned. Genuine — because the absurdity of everything, the walking in circles, the gravel, the girl next to me who thought she was curing my passivity when she was sharpening something she wouldn't recognize until later. She looked at me when I laughed and something in her expression shifted — surprise, pleasure, the brief illumination of a person who had forgotten that sounds like that existed. Then she looked forward and set a slightly faster pace and I matched it and my lungs burned worse and I was alive and angry and the two things felt like the same thing.

**Day three: preparation.** Jim held a final service.

In the basement, by candlelight, the eight of us plus Caleb's zoo of wooden animals lined up on the folding table. Jim read from Isaiah. Ruth sang something I didn't recognize — older, simpler, a melody that felt like it had been composed by people in a situation like ours. Dale sat with his hands on his knees, still, the first time I'd seen him fully still without tension. Maria was beside him, her shoulder touching his. They'd been fighting about rationing two hours ago. Now they were touching. The distances people traverse in the space of an evening.

During the reading, I saw Marcus lean toward Sienna. He was speaking low — below the candlelight, below Jim's voice, the murmur of a man delivering information he didn't want overheard. Sienna's face changed. Not dramatically — a tightening around the eyes, a stillness in the jaw, the controlled rearrangement of someone receiving news they have to absorb without reacting. Marcus glanced at me as he spoke. The glance was brief and it contained pity and I hated it — hated the pity, hated that Marcus had decided this was information Sienna needed, hated that he was right, hated that the information was *my mother is standing in a parking lot six blocks from here and the organism took her* and that someone other than me was saying it because I couldn't.

Sienna didn't look at me. Not during the reading, not during Ruth's song, not during the prayer. She was careful about it — the deliberate not-looking of a person who understood that the wrong kind of attention at the wrong moment would crack something that was barely holding. She knew she couldn't help. The knowing was in her posture — the way she sat slightly forward, slightly toward me, without turning, without reaching, the body language of someone standing at the edge of a wound they can see but can't touch.

Jim prayed. The prayer was short: "Lord, we're leaving tomorrow. We don't know if we'll make it. But we're going because staying is the slower way to die and You didn't make us for sitting still. Walk with us. Or if You won't walk with us, at least walk ahead of us and flatten the trail for Ruth. Amen."

Ruth said, "The trail doesn't need flattening. I need better knees."

Jim said, "I'll pray for those too."

During the planning days Jim mentioned a dream. Casual, over coffee, the way he mentioned everything — as if the thing he was saying was less important than the act of saying it and the act of saying it was less important than the coffee.

"I dreamed about a woman in a lab coat," he said. "She was standing at a desk covered in papers — printouts, graphs, numbers I couldn't read. She showed me one of the printouts and said, 'The numbers are wrong but the math is close.' Then she took the printout back and corrected something and showed it to me again and said, 'Closer.'" He sipped his coffee. "She had kind eyes. Tired. The eyes of someone who's been working too long on something that matters too much."

I looked at him. "You've never met Dr. Moss."

"I've never met anyone in a lab coat, son. The closest I've come to a laboratory is the church kitchen, and Ruth's the only one running experiments in there." He smiled. "Probably just my brain filling in details. I've been listening to her broadcasts. The subconscious builds a picture."

He was probably right. The brain does that — takes scattered data and assembles it into narratives during sleep. It didn't mean anything. Except that Jim had described a woman at a desk correcting printouts, and when we reached the university five weeks later, Dr. Moss's desk was covered in exactly the printouts he'd described, and she did have kind eyes, and she did say something about the math being close, and Jim looked at me when she said it and said nothing, and I said nothing, and neither of us needed to.

Marcus and Dale made a second run — the bike shop on Main Street. They came back with eight bicycles, two of them electric with charges that Marcus estimated at fifteen to twenty miles. Ruth and Jim got the e-bikes. The plan was simple: ride twenty miles to the OHT trailhead on Forest Service Road 1003, leave the bikes, start walking. Twenty miles of road we wouldn't have to hike. Twenty miles of pavement before the real suffering began.

Marcus packed the CB radio. He'd been listening every evening, catching fragments of Moss's broadcasts, confirming she was still there, still transmitting, still offering what she had. The last fragment, caught the night before: "— the frequency emitter has a range of approximately eighty meters. Within that radius, the Turned's collective coordination is disrupted. They become individuals again. Disoriented. Passive. The emitter buys time. It is not a solution. But time is what —" Static.

Eighty meters. A circle of safety in a world that had none. It was waiting for us on the other side of the mountains, and all we had to do was walk sixty miles of trail and another thirty-five of highway through the most rugged terrain in the state at the pace of a seventy-two-year-old woman without anyone's heart rate crossing a line that none of us could see.

The last night at the church, Jim held a service. Not the brief candle-and-psalm services he'd been doing on Wednesdays — a real one. Hymns. A reading from Ecclesiastes. A silence at the end that lasted so long I thought he'd forgotten what came next, and then I realized the silence *was* what came next, and that the silence was the sermon.

Afterward, nobody went to bed. We sat in the basement and talked about things that had nothing to do with tomorrow. Ruth described her first year of teaching — the room she was given, the chalk that was always the wrong color, the principal who called her "dear" until she told him to stop. Marcus talked about Ava's birthday party and the purple frosting and how she'd insisted on a theme of "dogs in space" and he'd built her a cardboard rocket ship with a stuffed beagle inside. Maria said the filing system at the law firm was the only beautiful thing she'd ever created, and the way she said "beautiful" — serious, without irony — made everyone go quiet for a moment because she meant it.

Dale gave Sienna the cardinal he'd carved. She turned it in her hands, feeling the feathers he'd cut into the wood, and said, "My mom has a cardinal that comes to our feeder every morning," and Dale said, "I know. You told me," and I didn't know when she'd told him that, which meant there were conversations happening in this basement that I wasn't part of, which meant the group had grown its own connective tissue without me organizing it, and that was the best thing I'd learned in three weeks.

Sienna and I ended up on the stairs, which was our spot when we needed to talk without an audience. She had her knees pulled up, her chin resting on them. I sat one step below because the stairs were narrow and proximity required negotiation.

She knew. I could feel it — the silence between us had changed. Before, her silences were tactical, the pauses of a girl choosing her next challenge. This one was careful. She was sitting next to a thing she'd been told not to touch.

She didn't mention my mother. She didn't ask if I was okay. She said:

"I'm scared." Not a confession. A measurement. The way she'd report a heart rate.

"Me too."

"Good. Honest people live longer." She bumped her knee against my shoulder. "We're going to make it."

"You don't know that."

"No. But I'm saying it anyway. And you're going to remember I said it on day three of the trail when your legs are gone and you want to quit. Deal?"

"Deal."

She went to the basement. I sat on the stairs for a while longer, listening to the sounds of people settling — blankets rustling, whispered goodnights, the small coughs and sighs that mean a room full of humans is transitioning from awake to asleep. These were the sounds of my congregation, and I use that word deliberately because Jim would understand it and because it's the right one.

I sat in the steeple one last time. The parking lot, the road, the trailer park across Highway 21. My trailer was still there — Lot 7, the one with the dented mailbox and the propane tank I'd knocked with my hip on the night of my first mistake. Somewhere inside it, on a shelf above the washer-dryer, *Brunner & Suddarth's Medical-Surgical Nursing* sat where I'd left it, open to the chapter on the autonomic nervous system, the passage about cognitive dissonance circled in pencil.

I wouldn't go back for it. The textbook had taught me what it could. Everything after this would be learned on the trail.

Tomorrow we walked.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #12:**

*Day 24. Marcus's route, not mine. His is longer and safer and he's right. "A map is a picture of a place. It is not the place." I'm going to tattoo this on my brain.*

*My pack weighs thirty-two pounds. Maria said twenty-five. The extra seven are food I added because I know what hungry feels like and I'd rather carry it than feel it.*

*I saw my mother today. She was standing in the hospital parking lot in her blue scrubs. She was smiling. The organism's smile, not hers. I am not going to write about this yet. I am going to carry it the way I carry everything — in the part of my brain that processes data without feeling it. The data is: she is gone. The feeling is: I can't.*

*There is something else. Not grief. Something with edges. I expected sadness and I got that, but underneath the sadness is something harder, something that does not sit still the way grief sits still. I am not going to write about that either. Not yet. It is useful in a way that frightens me.*

*I am terrified. My resting heart rate is 68. The gap between those two facts is the only thing keeping me alive.*
