# Chapter 10: The Lyles

We heard the bullhorn on Day 10.

I was in the steeple on morning watch — 6 AM, early October light catching frost on the parking lot gravel, sixteen Turned in their positions like chess pieces on a board I was learning to read. The newest arrival was a woman in hospital scrubs who'd walked in from Highway 21 sometime in the night. She stood near the road, swaying faintly, face tilted toward the eastern horizon. Her scrub top was gone — just the pants and a sports bra, her torso bare to the morning air. The skin across her shoulders had the greenish cast I'd been tracking, darker than Pembrook's at the same stage. She'd removed the top herself. It was folded on the curb behind her, neat, the way you'd fold laundry.

Then, from the north — maybe three blocks — a voice, amplified, distorted by distance and cheap electronics:

"THIS IS A SECURE ZONE. SURVIVORS WELCOME. WE ARE ARMED AND DEFENDED. COME TO THE AMERICAN FLAG ON CEDAR STREET."

I put the binoculars to my eyes and found it: a house, two-story, three blocks north and one east. Plywood over the windows. A generator humming — I could hear it now, a low mechanical drone that carried in the silence. An American flag hung from the roof gutters, oversized, the kind you'd see at a car dealership. And on the front porch, a man with a bullhorn and a rifle slung across his chest.

I watched the Turned react. Every head in the parking lot turned toward the sound. Several began walking — not toward the church, toward the noise. The woman in scrubs drifted north. Two others followed. The bullhorn was a magnet, and it was pulling Turned away from us and toward whoever was up there broadcasting their position to every organism in a half-mile radius.

I went downstairs.

"Craig Lyle," Jim said. He was sitting at the folding table with his coffee, his metoprolol, and his Bible. He didn't look surprised. "Sheriff's deputy. His wife Tammy runs the range on Highway 64. Son Brett, plays linebacker for Clarksville."

"He's using a bullhorn," I said.

"Craig would."

"He's drawing them. I watched three Turned start walking toward his house in the last five minutes."

Jim sipped his coffee. "Craig is a good man. He protected this town for twenty years. He's doing what he knows how to do."

"What he knows how to do is drawing every Turned in a half-mile radius to his front yard. I don't know what happens when enough of them show up in one place, but I don't want to find out."

Jim set his mug down. He looked at me with the patient, measuring expression that I'd learned meant he was about to say something I needed to hear and didn't want to.

"You might be right," he said. "And if you're right, that doesn't give you the right to sit here and watch without trying."

"I'm not saying —"

"You're saying stay away because he's loud and he's wrong and his wrongness is useful to us because it draws Turned away from the church. You're calculating the strategic value of another man's mistake."

The kitchen was very quiet. Ruth, at the top of the stairs, had stopped pretending to read.

"I wasn't —" But I was. The thought had been there — half-formed, ugly — that the Lyles' noise was pulling Turned north and that was good for us. I hadn't articulated it because that would mean being the kind of person who calculates the value of another family's danger. I didn't want to be that person, but I was, and Jim had seen it before I had.

"We need to talk to them," Jim said.

Sienna, who'd been doing push-ups against the wall — her morning routine, the athlete's body demanding movement — stopped and turned around. "They have guns and a generator. We have canned corn and a pastor."

"We have information," I said.

"Information they won't want to hear." She looked at me. "You're going to walk up to an armed sheriff's deputy and tell him his survival strategy is wrong? You?"

The "you" carried weight. She didn't mean it cruelly. She meant: you, the kid who won't make eye contact at the grocery store, who couldn't order food at a restaurant without rehearsing the sentence. That "you."

"Not me," I said. "Jim and Marcus. They're adults. Craig will listen to adults."

"Craig will listen to authority," Marcus said from his corner — sitting, listening, saying nothing until he had something worth saying, the way Marcus always did. "He's law enforcement. He respects rank. Jim's a pastor, I'm old enough to not be dismissed. We go."

---

They went at noon, when I'd observed the Turned were most dispersed. I watched from the steeple, walkie-talkie in hand, the same setup as every mission since we'd found the radios — I called down the positions, they adjusted their route. Jim and Marcus walked north on the residential streets behind the church — side streets, quiet, a few Turned visible at distance but none close. They moved at Jim's pace, which was the pace of a man who'd been walking calmly through a dangerous world for two weeks and had elevated it to an art form.

I had the binoculars. Sienna was beside me — she'd insisted on steeple duty during the mission — and we were sitting eighteen inches apart in the narrow space and I was acutely aware of every one of those eighteen inches because I was fifteen and the person next to me was Sienna Okafor.

She smelled like soap. The church had bar soap in the bathroom and she used it and she smelled like Ivory soap and I hated my brain for noticing this during a surveillance operation.

"They're there," Sienna said. She had sharper eyes than me. Through the binoculars I found them: Jim and Marcus at the Lyles' porch. Craig Lyle had come out — big man, crew cut, sheriff's department jacket, rifle in his hands but pointed down. Body language: wary, not hostile. He shook Jim's hand.

They talked for twenty minutes. I couldn't hear it. I could read posture: Jim leaning forward, earnest, palms open. Marcus standing back, arms crossed, the body language of a man offering backup, not argument. Craig listening. Head tilting. The small adjustments people make when they're processing information that doesn't fit their model.

Then Craig shook his head. Politely. He clapped Jim on the shoulder. He said something. Jim said something back. Craig went inside.

Jim and Marcus walked back. Twenty minutes there, twenty minutes home. My heart rate was elevated the entire time and when they came through the side door I realized I'd been clenching my jaw so hard my teeth ached.

"He listened," Jim said. "He didn't hear."

"What did you tell him?"

"That the noise draws them. That the fortifications create a target. That the mechanism is about physiology, not firepower."

"And?"

"He said he appreciated the concern. He said he had a duty to protect his family. He said he'd survived twenty years in law enforcement by trusting his training and he wasn't going to stop now." Jim paused. "He's not wrong about any of that. He's just applying it to the wrong situation."

"He can't hear you," I said. "Because if you're right, then everything he's done — the boards, the guns, the perimeter — all of it was wrong. And if that's wrong, he doesn't know how to protect his family. That's scarier than the Turned."

Ruth's voice came from the top of the stairs. "Cognitive dissonance. The brain rejects new information that contradicts existing belief because revising the belief is more painful than the danger of keeping it." She had her novel in her hand, finger marking her page. "I taught high school psychology for six years before I switched to English. Craig Lyle isn't stupid. He's protecting himself from a thought he can't afford to have."

Jim looked at her, then at me. "Knowing why he won't listen doesn't help him listen."

"No," Ruth said. "But it tells you what you're up against. The human brain is its own obstacle, and it might be the bigger one." She went back to her book.

That afternoon, Ruth did something that changed my model of her.

We had a problem. The church's water supply was gravity-fed from the municipal tower, and the pressure had been dropping for days. The tank on the roof — a supplemental cistern Jim had installed years ago for the baptistery — had a float valve that regulated inflow, and the valve was stuck. No pressure meant no refill. We had maybe two days of stored water.

Dale offered to climb to the roof. Marcus said he'd go. Jim said it was his church and his roof. I started calculating whether we could rig a manual pump from parts in the building.

Ruth walked past all of us, went to the utility closet, and came back with a pipe wrench, a roll of Teflon tape, and a pair of channel-lock pliers. She climbed the access ladder to the roof hatch — seventy-two years old, bad knees — and we heard her up there for about fifteen minutes. Clanking. One muffled curse. Then the sound of water running.

She came back down with grease on her hands and her cardigan askew.

"My husband was a plumber," she said, to the room's collective silence. "Forty-one years. I helped him on jobs every summer. The float valve was corroded — I freed the stem and re-seated the gasket. It'll hold for now. The Teflon tape is a temporary fix; you'll want to replace the entire assembly when circumstances permit." She looked at our faces. "What? You thought all I could do was correct your grammar?"

"I thought —" I started.

"You thought I was an old woman with a pill bottle and a sharp tongue. That's fair. I cultivated that impression. It's useful — people who underestimate you leave you alone, and being left alone is my preferred state." She washed her hands at the kitchen sink. "Leonard — my husband — died in 2019. Heart attack on a job site. I learned more from him than from any education course I ever took, and I took all of them. He could fix anything." She dried her hands. "I can fix *most* things."

She went back upstairs to her novel.

I updated my mental model of Ruth Fenn: a woman who'd spent forty years alongside a tradesman and absorbed a skillset none of us had thought to ask about because we'd been too busy being corrected about grammar.

The assumptions you don't question are the ones that kill you. I'd written that in the notebook about the Lyles. It applied closer to home than I'd realized.

That evening, Maria and I had a conversation that I didn't expect and didn't like.

She was doing inventory — counting cans, updating the rationing spreadsheet she'd scratched onto a church bulletin. I was at the folding table with the notebook, mapping Turned positions.

"The Lyles have food," she said. Not looking up from her count.

"The Lyles have a lot of things."

"If something happens to them — if that house gets overrun — their supplies will still be in there. Canned goods, ammunition, the generator fuel."

I put my pen down. "You're planning to scavenge the Lyles' supplies."

"I'm planning for the group to survive. Those are the same thing." She turned a can of green beans label-out and placed it on the shelf. "Every person who joins us costs us 1.3 days of food at current rationing. Marcus cost us 1.3 days. The next person will too. If we take in survivors without replenishing supplies, we starve together instead of separately. That's not compassion. That's arithmetic."

"Maria —"

"I'm not saying don't help people. I'm saying know the cost. And I'm saying that if something happens over there, the supplies in that house become available and we need to be ready to get them before the rain ruins them or we lose the chance."

She was right. I hated that she was right. I hated more that the thought hadn't occurred to me — that Maria had looked at the Lyles' situation and calculated the caloric contingency before I had.

"That's cold," I said.

"Yes." She put the last can on the shelf and closed the closet door. "So is January. We'll need the calories."

She went to bed. I sat at the table and stared at my map and thought about whether there was a real line between being cold and being right, or whether we drew it after the fact to feel better about decisions we'd already made.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #5:**

*Day 10. Two modes confirmed. Herding is coordinated strategy. The food-driven behavior is coordinated predation. I suspect there's a third — something that happens when enough of them gather in one place. I don't have evidence yet. I have a feeling, and feelings aren't data.*

*The clothing pattern connects to the green skin and the light orientation. Bare feet first, then shirts. The oldest Turned are the most exposed. The organism is systematically removing anything that covers the skin. I'm circling something I'm not ready to name.*

*Maria is already planning what to do with the Lyles' supplies when they fall. I think she always sees the cost. I think the cost is what she's calculating when the rest of us think she's just counting cans.*

*Ruth called Craig's situation cognitive dissonance. She might be describing mine too. I understand the mechanism and still can't act on it. Knowing and doing are separated by a gap I haven't figured out how to cross. The textbook doesn't have a chapter for that.*
