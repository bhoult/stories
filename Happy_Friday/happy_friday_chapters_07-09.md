# Chapter 7: The Pattern

We crossed Highway 21 at 7:15 AM on a Tuesday in October, which is not a sentence I expected to describe as the bravest thing I'd ever done.

Sienna had slept on the couch — or not slept, more accurately. She'd lain on the couch with her shoes on and her eyes open, watching the ceiling, while I took the bathroom floor again because the bathroom was the room I'd claimed as mine through repeated misery and at this point it felt like territory. I'd given her the blanket from my mom's bed. She didn't argue. Athletes know when to conserve.

I was wearing my only clean clothes — a pair of gym shorts and a Clarksville Panthers t-shirt two sizes too small that my mom had bought at a school fundraiser. Everything else I owned was in a garbage bag by the back door: the jeans and hoodie from the night under Henderson's trailer, still stiff with dried mud and vomit and whatever else had soaked into them from the ground. I'd tried to wash them in the sink. The stains faded but didn't leave. The smell faded but didn't leave. I threw them away eventually. Some things don't come clean.

Two hundred yards. My back door to Jim's church. In the old world, four minutes. We stood at the back door and breathed. Sienna counted — four in, hold four, out six — her voice doing more for my heart rate than any technique I'd read about. My hand throbbed in its sock bandage. The fever was low but present, a warmth behind my eyes that made everything slightly unreal.

"Ready?" she said.

"No."

"Good. Honest people live longer." She opened the door.

The park was quiet in the pre-dawn grey. Six Turned visible. Pembrook in his usual spot, face tilted toward the eastern horizon. The discoloration on his skin was darker than two days ago — the greyish-green spreading down his forearms. My first thought was decomposition — that the Turned were breaking down, rotting on their feet the way corpses do, and that if we waited long enough they'd simply fall apart. It was the last piece of the old framework, the zombie-movie version where the dead things eventually stop being a problem because dead things decay. But Pembrook wasn't decaying. He was eating and drinking and sorting garbage with purpose. Whatever was happening to his skin was something else — not breaking down but changing, progressing toward something I couldn't identify.

We moved. Slow. Measured. Sienna moved better than I did — lighter, more coordinated, her feet finding the quieter spots between stones. I moved like what I was: a hundred and eighty pounds of anxiety impersonating nonchalance. Each crunch of gravel sent a jolt through me that I had to manually override, and at one point Sienna's hand touched my elbow — a brief pressure — and the spiral broke and I didn't think about the fact that her hand touched my elbow because I was focused on survival and not on the warmth of the contact point, I was *not* thinking about it, I was thinking about gravel.

A Turned man in a Carhartt jacket took two steps toward us and stopped. Head cocked, like a dog hearing a frequency it can't place. Ten seconds. Then he turned away.

We reached Highway 21. Asphalt empty in both directions. Crossed. Past the church parking lot I could see the sign — hand-lettered on cardboard, propped in the side window, angled toward the road. Block letters in black marker:

**KEEP CALM. COME INSIDE. DON'T RUN.**

Jim had placed it to be visible from the road. He'd thought about the angle, the letter size, the window height. He'd placed it the way you place a lighthouse — to catch people at the moment they most need direction. I don't know how many people that sign saved. I know it saved us, because it was the reason we'd known where to go, and I hadn't even consciously registered reading it from the trailer park until this moment, standing in the parking lot, seeing it from the intended distance and understanding that everything about its placement was deliberate.

The side door opened before we reached it. Jim Whittaker — big man gone thin, late sixties, white hair cropped military-short, flannel shirt and khakis — held the door open and didn't say a word until we were inside and the bolt was thrown.

"Delia's boy," he said. "And the Okafor girl. Took you long enough."

The bolt clicked home. The sound of a lock engaging had never meant more.

# Chapter 8: The Church of Whoever's Left

## ACT TWO: CONGREGATION
### *"Turns out the apocalypse is mostly committee meetings."*

---

Jim made coffee. The power was still on — barely — and he made it on the kitchen's electric burner and poured three cups and the smell of it was so ordinary that my knees went soft. Sienna took hers black. I took mine with enough sugar to qualify as dessert because I was fifteen and had the palate of a fifteen-year-old and I did not care that Sienna watched me dump three packets of sugar in and raised one eyebrow.

Jim sat across from us and studied our faces. He took his time. I realized he was making a decision — not about whether to help us, but about how much to tell us.

"How did you get here?" he asked. Not the route. He meant: how did you survive?

I told him. The window. The watching. The pattern — everyone who panicked turned, everyone who stayed calm didn't. I told him about the textbook and the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenaline cascade. I talked too long. I always talk too long when I'm nervous and I was nervous because this was the first adult I'd spoken to in five days who was alive and sane and I wanted him to take me seriously.

Jim listened without interrupting. When I finished he nodded once, slowly, the way you nod when someone confirms something you already believed for different reasons.

"The Lord protects the peaceful," he said. "That's what I've been telling myself. The meek shall inherit the earth — I always read that as a promise about the afterlife. Turns out it might be operational advice."

He'd been watching the same pattern I had. The people who prayed, who sat still, who surrendered to something larger than their fear — they survived. The people who fought, who panicked, who trusted their own strength — they turned. Jim had framed it as theology. God's hand, sheltering the faithful. His conclusion was identical to mine: *stay calm, don't fight, don't flee.* His reasoning was completely different.

"Jim," I said. "What medications are you on?"

He set his mug down. "That's personal, son."

"It matters."

He looked at me the way adults look at you when you've asked a question that forces them to take you seriously — the slight recalibration, the moment where "kid" becomes "person." "Metoprolol. Fifty milligrams, twice a day. For my heart."

"It's a beta-blocker. It suppresses the sympathetic nervous system — the adrenaline response. That's why they don't bother you."

Jim picked up his coffee. Sipped it. Put it down.

"Those aren't mutually exclusive," he said. "The medication and the peace."

He was right in a way I was too smart to understand at the time. The metoprolol kept his body under the threshold. His faith kept his mind there. And his faith had produced the sign in the window, which had saved at least three lives, while my correct understanding of the mechanism had produced a notebook.

I would learn, later, to hold both of these truths at once without needing to resolve them — Jim's theology and my pharmacology, both incomplete, both functional, pointing at the same survival behavior from opposite directions. The textbook had a term for the discomfort of holding contradictory beliefs simultaneously: cognitive dissonance. Most people resolve it by collapsing one side — picking the explanation that feels better and discarding the other. Jim didn't. He held "God protects the peaceful" and "metoprolol suppresses the HPA axis" in the same hand and didn't flinch. That capacity — the willingness to sit with two incompatible truths without demanding a single answer — would turn out to be more important than either truth alone. The people who survived this world would be the ones who could hold the old and the new at the same time, who could let their assumptions and their observations coexist long enough for something useful to emerge from the friction.

But I didn't understand that yet. I just thought Jim was wrong for the right reasons. Wrong reasons, right answers. I would see this pattern until it broke me.

Jim watched me process this. Then he made his decision.

"There are others," he said. "Downstairs."

He'd been waiting. He'd opened his door to us, given us coffee, listened to our story — but he'd kept the others hidden until he was sure. Sure of what? That we weren't going to panic. That we weren't going to bring noise and chaos and adrenaline into the one quiet place he'd built. That our hearts were steady enough to be trusted with the people he'd already gathered.

I understood this. I would have done the same thing.

---

"Let me see your hand," said a voice from the stairwell.

Ruth Fenn was seventy-two years old and she came down the stairs the way she apparently did everything: with complete authority and zero patience. She was five-foot-two, white-haired, wearing a cardigan over a floral blouse, and she looked at me the way she'd looked at a thousand seventh-graders who'd come to class without their homework.

"I said let me see it."

I held out my hand. She unwrapped the sock — her nose wrinkled at the sock — and examined the bite with the clinical attention of someone who knew exactly what she was looking at. "Cellulitis. Early stage. You're running a fever."

"How do you —"

"I taught for thirty-nine years. Do you know how many children I sent to the nurse's office with infected cuts, ringworm, impetigo, and one memorable case of scabies? I can spot an infection from across a classroom." She turned to Jim. "Antibiotic ointment. First aid kit. And something that isn't a *sock.*"

She cleaned the wound with hydrogen peroxide from the church's first aid kit, applied antibiotic ointment, and bandaged it with actual gauze and medical tape, all while narrating what she was doing and correcting my grammar.

"You bit yourself? Deliberately?"

"To keep from making noise."

"Hm. Resourceful. Unsanitary. The word is 'bit,' not 'bited,' if you were wondering."

"I wasn't."

"You were about to be." She taped the gauze with the precision of a woman who had applied approximately ten thousand Band-Aids in her career. "Your mother is Delia Carver. I taught her. Mediocre student, excellent human being. She would be appalled by this bandage."

"She would."

"She'd also be proud of you. Don't let that go to your head." She patted the bandage once — firm, not gentle — and returned upstairs to the sanctuary where she was, Jim said, reading a romance novel and had been for two days.

---

The Sotos were in the basement.

I learned about Dale and Maria Soto the way you learn about people when the world has ended: in fragments, sideways, through the small behaviors that replace conversation when the context for normal conversation no longer exists.

Dale carved. He sat in a metal folding chair with a chunk of two-by-four and a folding knife and he carved constantly — small, precise strokes, wood shavings collecting at his feet like a second skin. I watched him for ten minutes before I realized he was making something specific: a beagle, ears down, in the posture of a dog waiting.

"I'm on Suboxone," he said, without looking up, because he'd caught me looking. "Maintenance. For opioid use disorder, which is the polite way of saying I was a junkie for six years and now I take a pill that keeps me level. My counselor said I was 'chemically balanced.' What she meant was my emotions don't spike. In normal life that's a problem." Stroke, stroke, curl of wood falling. "In this, it's the only reason I'm alive."

Maria was reorganizing the food pantry closet. She'd taken everything off the shelves, sorted it by category and expiration date, and was reloading it according to a system that made sense only to her. Ruth appeared at the bottom of the stairs and watched for a moment.

"Alphabetical would be more practical," Ruth said.

"Caloric density per unit of weight," Maria said, without turning around. "The heavy, low-calorie items go in the front. You eat those first while you're stationary. The light, high-calorie stuff goes in the back — that's what you grab if you have to move."

"That's not alphabetical."

"No. It's correct."

They stared at each other. Two women whose response to the end of the world was to organize whatever was in front of them, now locked in a silent territorial negotiation over a closet full of canned corn.

"I suppose," Ruth said, "that 'fewer calories' is at least grammatically sound."

Maria almost smiled. It was a small, bitter thing — the kind of smile that says *I see you and I don't have the energy to fight but I'm not conceding.* "I was an office manager for nine years. I organized a filing system for a law firm with eleven attorneys who all had different ideas about what 'alphabetical' meant. I can organize a food closet."

"I'm sure you can, dear." Ruth went back upstairs.

Maria finished the closet. I noticed she'd arranged it so the heavy items — canned vegetables, jars of sauce, the things with the most weight per calorie — were at the front and bottom, easy to reach, meant to be consumed first while we were sheltering in place. The light, calorie-dense items — jerky, nuts, protein bars, dried fruit — were in the back and on the top shelf, packed tight and ready to grab. If we had to leave in a hurry, you'd sweep the top shelf into a bag and go, and what you carried would be light and would keep you alive the longest. It was the organizational logic of someone who had already accepted that staying wasn't permanent.

"How long will this last?" I asked. Meaning the food.

"Sixteen days at current rationing. Twenty if we cut portions. Less if more people arrive." She said this the way you'd read a weather forecast — factual, without opinion.

"More people will arrive."

"Then less." She closed the closet. "That's how it works. Every person we help is a day we lose. I'm not saying don't help. I'm saying know the cost."

---

Sienna couldn't sit still.

On the second day at the church, she announced she was going to scout the surrounding blocks. Not asked — announced. I opened my mouth to argue and she said, "I'm not asking," and left through the side door before Jim could finish saying "Be careful."

She came back three hours later.

I was in the steeple — we'd established an observation post, two-hour shifts — and I watched her cross Highway 21, moving well. Then I watched her face as she came through the side door, and I knew something was wrong because her expression had the particular flatness of someone who has seen something they can't process and has decided to postpone processing it.

She climbed to the steeple. We sat on opposite sides of the narrow space, the binoculars between us, the late October sun cutting through the louvers.

"The interchange," she said. "I went to the interchange."

"Sienna —"

"The military vehicles are still there. Humvees, trucks, the whole perimeter. Some of the Turned are still in the area — maybe fifteen, twenty. They're scattered. Not coordinated like the ones here." She paused. "The bodies are still there too. The ones who died in the firefight. Soldiers who were shot before they turned."

I waited.

"The Turned are eating them."

The steeple was very quiet. Below us, through the floor, I could hear Dale's knife on wood.

"Not — it's not frenzied. It's not like animals tearing at — it's methodical. They crouch over the bodies and they — they *take pieces.* One at a time. Carefully. Like they're rationing. There are maybe six bodies left out of what was probably — I don't know, however many died in the gunfire. There were more. You can tell. There were more."

Her hands were in her lap and they were steady. Her voice was steady. But her eyes were the eyes of a person who has seen the floor open up beneath the last assumption that was keeping them upright.

"I was wrong," she said. "About going back there. About the supplies. The Turned are congregating around the bodies as a food source. Going there for equipment means going through them while they're feeding. And they're — they noticed me. Not the herding behavior, not the grin. Something different. They looked at me the way —" She stopped. Tried again. "The way a dog looks at you when it's eating and you get too close. Protective. Territorial. I've never seen them do that before."

"That's new," I said. "The herding behavior is about reproduction — about scaring you into turning. What you're describing is about calories. Those are different drives."

"I know what it is, Nate. You don't need to categorize it for me. They were eating people."

She was right. I didn't need to categorize it. But categorizing was what I did instead of feeling, and right now feeling would mean sitting with the image of Turned crouched over human remains in a military staging area and processing what that meant for the future — that when the Walmart food ran out and the gardens were stripped and the livestock was consumed, the Turned would remember that people are made of calories.

"The supplies," I said. "Was there anything accessible without going through the feeding area?"

"Maybe. The trucks at the back of the perimeter. I couldn't get close enough to check. I'd need to go back. With someone." She looked at me. "Not yet. I need to — I need to not think about it for a while."

I wanted to say something useful. Something analytical that would reframe the horror into data. Instead what came out was: "Are you okay?"

It was a stupid question. She wasn't okay. Nobody was okay. But she looked at me and her face did something I hadn't seen before — a crack in the composure, brief, quickly sealed — and she said, "No. But I'm here. That counts."

We sat in the steeple and watched the sun move across the parking lot. The Turned below shifted with it — that slow collective turn, faces tilting toward the light. I watched Sienna's profile against the louver slats and the sunset light caught her jaw and her throat and my brain did the thing again, the useless thing, the *notice this* thing, and I looked away.

"Jaylen's seven," she said. After a long silence. "He's obsessed with dinosaurs. He can name every species in the Cretaceous period. When I left for school in the morning he'd be at the kitchen table with his dinosaur books and he'd quiz me. 'Sienna, what's bigger, a T-rex or a Giganotosaurus?' I always got it wrong on purpose because it made him so happy to correct me."

She was quiet.

"I don't know if he's alive," she said. "Oklahoma City is — it's big. The population density. If they didn't make it to my grandmother's before —" She stopped. Took a breath. "I can handle the Turned. I can handle the blockade. I can handle what I saw today. I can't handle not knowing about Jaylen. That's the thing that's going to break me, if something does."

"It won't."

"You don't know that."

"No. But you walked through a military staging area full of — through *that* — and you came back and you're here and you're telling me about it. Whatever breaks you, it isn't this."

She looked at me. The expression was unreadable. Then she said, "You're not bad at this."

"At what?"

"At being a person. You think you're bad at it. You're not."

I didn't know what to do with that so I looked through the binoculars. The Walmart across I-40 had a cluster of Turned in its parking lot — twenty, twenty-five, more than I'd seen there before. They were milling in a pattern I didn't recognize, tighter than their usual spacing, and some of them were twitchy — small jerky movements, heads snapping toward nothing, a restlessness that felt different from their normal stillness. Like a voltage building up. Like static before a storm.

I wrote it in the notebook: *Walmart cluster. ~25. Agitated. Something different about the group dynamics at this density. Watch this.*

I underlined "watch this" twice.

---

Jim held a service on Wednesday. Six people in candlelight. He read a psalm, said a prayer, was quiet. Ruth sang "Amazing Grace" — first verse, thin soprano, cracks on the high notes. The silence after was the most sacred thing I'd ever experienced, and I don't believe in sacred.

Later that night, I couldn't sleep. I went to the sanctuary and found Jim sitting in a pew in the dark, hands folded, staring at the cross on the wall. He didn't look like a man at peace. He looked like a man holding something heavy.

"Can't sleep either?" I said.

"I sleep fine." A pause. "I pray poorly." Another pause. "Do you know what the hardest part of faith is, son?"

"No."

"It's not believing when things are good. It's not even believing when things are bad. The hardest part is believing when things are *meaningless.* When there's no plan, no purpose, no lesson. When it's just — some biology gone wrong. Some accident nobody caused and nobody deserved and none of it was aimed at us."

I sat down. One pew back. Giving him the space.

"I've been a pastor for thirty years and a soldier before that. I've buried children. I've held dying men. And in all of it I found meaning because I believed God was in it somewhere, working through the suffering toward something I couldn't see. But this." He gestured at the walls, the darkness, the world outside. "This isn't suffering toward something. This is just — biology. Indifferent biology. And I keep waiting for God to show me the meaning and He keeps not showing me and I keep having faith anyway and I don't know if that makes me faithful or just stubborn."

"Does it matter?"

He looked at me. "It matters to me."

"I mean — does it matter *functionally*? You put the sign in the window. People are alive because of it. You're here making coffee and holding services and keeping people together. Whether God told you to do that or your own decency told you — the result is the same."

"That's a very young thing to say."

"I'm fifteen. Everything I say is young."

He almost smiled. Then the almost-smile faded and he was just a tired old man in a dark church. "I told Ruth the Lord protects the peaceful. And I believe that. But I also know it's the metoprolol, and I know it's the beta-blockade, and I know that if the medication runs out I'll have to find out whether my faith is strong enough to keep my heart rate below whatever the number is. And I don't know if it is."

He said this to me and not to any of the adults because I was the one who'd named the mechanism, and naming it had made me the person he could be honest with, and I didn't want that responsibility and I had it anyway.

"Your faith got us here," I said. "That's data."

"Data." He said the word like it was a foreign food he was willing to try. "I suppose it is."

He sat in the dark pew and I sat behind him and neither of us said anything else and after a while I went back to the basement and lay on a pew and looked at the ceiling and thought about faith and pharmacology and the place where they overlapped, and I didn't sleep but I was closer to sleeping than I'd been in a week.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #3:**

*Day 7. Seven people. Fourteen Turned outside. The number's growing.*

*Sienna found the military blockade. The Turned are eating the dead. Not frenzied — methodical. Rationing the bodies. This is what happens when the packaged food runs out. The organism needs its hosts fed, and when the easy calories are gone, the calculus changes. We are not dealing with something that will starve. We are dealing with something that will find new food.*

*The Walmart cluster is getting dense. Twenty-five, maybe more. Something in their behavior changes at density — a restlessness, a twitchiness. I need to watch this. I think there's a threshold where the collective coordination breaks down into something worse.*

*Jim doubts his faith in private and performs it in public and the performance saves lives. I understand the mechanism in private and fail to act in public and the understanding saves nobody. There's a lesson here about the relationship between knowledge and courage and I don't like what it says about me.*

# Chapter 9: The Asset

On the eighth day, a man walked into the church carrying a CB radio, a case of truck-stop beef jerky, and a flask of bourbon. His name was Marcus Webb. He was forty-two. He was a long-haul driver out of Tulsa who'd been hauling industrial shelving on I-40 when the highways turned into what he described as "a parking lot made of fire."

He sat in the basement on a folding chair too small for him and told us about three days in a truck cab. He said it flatly, without drama, with the cadence of a man who had been alone a long time and had decided to report rather than feel.

"I pulled onto a service road. Parked. Sat." He shrugged. "I've done five-day runs to Tacoma. I know how to sit."

"Three days," Jim said. "Alone."

"I was drinking." He held up the flask — stainless steel, dented. "Bourbon. It's not a solution. But it kept the —" He made a vague gesture at his chest. "It kept things level. For a while."

Maria, from the pantry closet, said: "Alcohol is a depressant. It suppresses the stress response short-term. Then you rebound worse than baseline. It's borrowing calm from tomorrow." She said this with the casual expertise of a woman who'd lived with an addict and had read every pamphlet in every waiting room.

Marcus looked at her. "You're not wrong."

"I rarely am." No warmth in it. Just fact. Maria's humor was like that — razor-edged, delivered without a smile, requiring you to decide for yourself whether she was joking. She usually wasn't.

Dale, carving in his corner, said nothing. But I saw his jaw tighten.

---

The CB radio was a Cobra 29 in a carrying case with an external antenna. Marcus set it on a folding table and powered it on and the static filled the room — the white noise of a spectrum that used to carry a thousand conversations. We gathered around it the way people in another century would have gathered around a fire.

Marcus scanned. Most channels dead. Channel 9 — emergency — carried a faint automated loop:

"Shelter in place. Remain calm. Assistance is being coordinated."

"How long has it been saying that?" Sienna asked.

"Five days. Nobody's updated it."

The implication: the system generating the message still ran, but the people managing it were gone. "Assistance is being coordinated" — I'd believed some version of that since Day One. Believed that somewhere, in a bunker or a command center, adults with plans and authority were working the problem. The automated loop on Channel 9 was the sound of that belief dying. The government wasn't coordinating assistance. The government was a recording playing to empty rooms.

He kept scanning. Fragments — half-sentences, voices fading in and out. A man in Missouri. Gone by morning. A woman in Oklahoma reporting I-44 impassable. A group in Memphis coordinating evacuation south. Marcus had listened for them the next day. Nothing.

"Channel 21," he said. "This is the one."

Static. Then, faint, a woman's voice. Calm. Precise. The cadence of someone reading from notes:

"— repeat, the mechanism is endocrine. The organism's activation is triggered by sustained elevation of catecholamine levels — specifically epinephrine and norepinephrine —"

Static swallowed the rest. The signal broke. Marcus adjusted the dial, the antenna. Nothing.

"That's all?"

"She broadcasts twice a day. Morning, evening. The signal's weak — low-power transmitter. I've caught maybe six fragments in three days." He pulled a piece of paper from his jacket pocket — a page torn from a logbook, covered in his handwriting. "I've been writing down what I can catch."

The fragments, assembled:
- *"mechanism is endocrine"*
- *"beta-adrenergic antagonists are protective"*
- *"the organism's protein structures do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny"*
- *"this is not a mutation — this is not a bioweapon"*
- Something about a frequency — acoustic — that *"disrupts collective coordination"*
- A name: *"Dr. Eleanor Moss"*
- A reference to *"the campus"* and a state route number — 16

*Do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny.* I read that fragment three times. I'd been carrying an assumption since Day One — the same one everybody carried, the same one the Reddit threads and the news anchors and the conspiracy theorists all shared: this was a pathogen. A virus, a prion, a bioweapon, something that fit into the categories we already had for things that make people sick. Dr. Moss had just crossed out every one of those categories. Not terrestrial. Not from here. The organism on the comet article I'd read in *Popular Science* surfaced in my memory and connected to the fragment and the connection was so obvious and so enormous that I sat there and didn't say anything for a full minute.

State Route 16. It ran north through the Boston Mountains to the university towns on the other side. The University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A real research university with biology labs and equipment and, apparently, at least one scientist who was still doing science while the world ended.

"Fayetteville," Marcus said. He'd arrived at the same conclusion. "Sixty miles northwest. Through the mountains."

---

Marcus Webb's brain contained a three-dimensional map of every road, rest stop, warehouse, and distribution center within three hundred miles. Compiled over fifteen years of driving routes most people never saw from the highway. It was more valuable than anything he carried.

"The Walmart's almost stripped," he said. We were in the basement, just the two of us. "I walked through it on my way here. Perishables spoiled. Canned goods half-depleted. Another week, bare shelves."

"Sienna found the military blockade," I said. "The Turned are feeding on the dead."

Marcus was quiet for a moment. Then: "How many bodies?"

"She counted six remaining. There were more."

"The interchange." He nodded, as if confirming something he'd already suspected. "High-traffic area. Lots of initial casualties. The Turned would drift there for the food. Which means the interchange is a feeding ground now, not just a concentration point."

"Could we drive through it?" I was still thinking like the old world. Roads go places. Cars are faster than walking. Highways are how you get from where you are to where you need to be. It seemed obvious.

"Drive." He said the word like I'd suggested we fly. "Kid, I need you to understand something about vehicles in this situation. A car engine is the loudest thing in a silent world. You fire up a truck and every Turned in a half-mile radius knows where you are. The highways are funnels — they concentrate everything into narrow corridors. Every interchange, every rest stop, every truck stop is a congregation point because those are the places people went when they were trying to get out, and those people are still there, and they're not people anymore."

He paused. Took a sip from the flask.

"You need to understand what happened on the highways that first night. Everybody's in their car. Everybody's got the radio on — the emergency broadcasts, the news, the same loop of *shelter in place* and *unexplained behavioral episodes* and nobody saying what's actually happening. People are scared. People who are scared drive fast. They tailgate, they swerve, they run red lights. The radio's telling them the world is ending and they're doing eighty in a sixty trying to get home to their families or get out of the city or just get *somewhere*, and their heart rates are through the roof, and the adrenaline is pumping, and —" He spread his hands. "You see where this goes. They turned at the wheel. Doing seventy, eighty miles an hour. The Turned don't know how to drive. They don't know how to brake. The car keeps going until it hits something — a guardrail, another car, the median. And then the next car hits that one. And the car behind that one. I saw a pileup on I-40 near Ozark that was thirty vehicles deep. Some of them were still running when I drove past, engines idling, wheels against guardrails, the drivers standing in the road with smooth faces."

He shook his head. "The highways didn't just fill up with Turned. They filled up with wrecks. The panic itself made the roads impassable before the Turned ever set foot on the asphalt. Every on-ramp is a bottleneck of crushed metal. Every bridge is a dam of jackknifed semis. You couldn't drive through it if the Turned weren't even there."

He paused again. "I drove for three days before I parked. The last ten miles I was threading between abandoned vehicles and clusters of Turned, and two of those clusters started massing up in a way I did not like. If I'd stalled, or hit something, or blown a tire — I'd be standing in a rest stop parking lot right now with a smooth face."

Roads weren't escape routes. Roads were traps — funnels that concentrated the Turned at every chokepoint, plugged with the wreckage of a million panicked drivers who turned before they reached wherever they were going. Another assumption from the old world, gone.

"So roads are out."

"Roads where people traveled are out. Back roads — farm roads, forest service roads — are better. Low traffic before, low density now. But even back roads connect to highways eventually, and the connection points are where it gets bad."

"What about off-road? Cross-country?"

"In what? My rig? A Humvee? The terrain between here and Fayetteville is the Boston Mountains. It's the roughest country in the state — sandstone bluffs, creek hollows, ravines. No vehicle short of a military crawler is getting through that. And a military crawler is the loudest thing you can drive."

He took a sip from his flask. Small. Measured. Not getting drunk — maintaining.

"There's a trail," he said. "The Ozark Highlands Trail. Runs through the national forest, mostly ridgelines. I've crossed it hauling timber loads — the forest service roads intersect it every ten, fifteen miles. Once you're up in the mountains, there's nothing. No population. No highways. The Turned go where people were. People weren't in the deep woods."

"You know the OHT?"

"I know every road that crosses it. Which means I know where you can get on and off." He looked at me. "It's sixty miles of mountain trail. With a seventy-two-year-old. In October. It's insane."

"Is there a better option?"

"No." He poured another measure into the flask cap. "That's the problem."

There was something about Marcus that I recognized but couldn't name until the third day. His calm wasn't like Jim's — effortful, maintained by faith and medication. It wasn't like mine — the defensive shutdown of a kid who'd retreated into analysis. Marcus's calm was the absence of something. A hollowness. The flat affect of a man who had been too sad for too long to be afraid.

In game theory there's a concept called a dominant strategy — one that produces the best outcome regardless of what the other players do. Marcus's depression was his dominant strategy. The thing that was slowly destroying his life outside the apocalypse was the thing keeping him alive inside it. He couldn't feel the acute terror the organism needed because something in him had broken years ago, and the broken place was exactly where the organism needed to reach.

He didn't talk about this. He talked about roads and supply chains. But on the third night, sitting in the basement after everyone else was asleep, he showed me something.

His phone. Dead, battery gone two weeks ago. He turned it on anyway — nothing, black screen — and held it up.

"My daughter," he said. "Ava. She's nine. Tulsa. The lock screen was a photo of her at her birthday party. Purple frosting on her face."

He looked at the dead phone.

"The battery died and I still carry it. That's — I don't know what that is. Pathology, probably. My ex-wife would say it's typical. 'Marcus holds onto things that don't work anymore.' She said that about our marriage and she was right." He put the phone back in his pocket. "Fayetteville is northwest. Tulsa is west. Every mile we walk toward Dr. Moss is a mile that isn't toward Ava. I know that. I'm doing it anyway because the math says Moss is the priority and I believe in the math. But I want you to know that the math is costing me something."

"I know."

"No, you don't. You're fifteen. You think sacrifice is a concept. It's not a concept. It's a direction. It's the specific act of walking the wrong way while knowing the right way exists." He capped the flask. "I hate roads. Did you know that? Fifteen years of driving and I hate every mile of highway I've ever seen. The white lines, the rest stops, the same Denny's in every truck stop in America. I hate it. And I know every road between here and Oklahoma like I know my own heartbeat because hating a thing and knowing it aren't mutually exclusive. Ask Jim about that — he'll tell you it's the same with faith."

I didn't know what to say. Marcus wasn't asking for comfort. He was making a deposit — putting something true into the record so that someone would know it, so that if he didn't make it to Tulsa, at least one person would understand what it cost him not to try.

"I'll put it in the journal," I said.

"Don't put in the crying part."

"You're not crying."

"I was going to. You interrupted." A beat. "That's a joke, kid. I make those sometimes. They're bad."

"You'll fit in. Jim's are worse."

On Thursday evening, Marcus caught another fragment from Dr. Moss. Clearer this time — she'd adjusted her antenna or the atmospheric conditions had shifted.

"— if you are receiving this, my name is Dr. Eleanor Moss. I am at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. I have data. I have a frequency. I have medication. If you can reach me —"

Static. Then, one more fragment:

"— every fortress is a countdown. Stay small. Stay quiet. Move before the density —"

Gone.

Every fortress is a countdown. I looked at the cinder-block walls of Grace Tabernacle and thought about the fourteen Turned in the parking lot and the twenty-five at the Walmart cluster and the feeding ground at the interchange and the six clocks I was building in my notebook — each one counting down to a zero that meant we had to be somewhere else.

"She's right," I said. "About the countdown."

Jim said nothing. His hands were folded. His face was the face of a man who'd been asked to leave his church, his congregation — even the Turned ones — and who knew the ask was coming and had been trying to pray his way out of it.

"Not yet," he said. "But soon."

Sienna, in the steeple, called down: "Another one just arrived in the parking lot. Fifteen now."

The number was growing. The clocks were running. And somewhere on the other side of the Boston Mountains, a woman with a radio and a lab was broadcasting into the dark, and we were the only ones listening.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #4:**

*Day 8. Seven people. Fifteen Turned. Counting up.*

*Dr. Moss is at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. Sixty miles through the worst terrain in the state. She has data, medication, a frequency that disrupts the Turned's coordination. She has answers. We have canned corn and a countdown.*

*Marcus says roads are death funnels. Cars are noise machines. The OHT runs through wilderness with no population. It's insane. It's the best option.*

*The Turned at the interchange are eating human remains. The Walmart food is running out. These facts exist on a timeline that converges on us. When the easy food is gone, the Turned won't starve politely. They'll expand their search radius. They'll come to the church. And when enough of them gather here, the thing that happens at density — the thing I've been watching build at the Walmart cluster — will happen in our parking lot. And these cinder-block walls will not save us.*

*I am fifteen years old and I am calculating the logistics of a sixty-mile walk through a mountain wilderness with a seventy-two-year-old woman and a man whose depression is his survival advantage and a pastor whose faith is running out and a couple held together by a medication with a shelf life and a girl who can't sit still and me. Me, who weighs a hundred and eighty pounds and gets winded on stairs.*

*This is the team. This is the plan. This is what we have.*

*God help us, and I'm saying that as a figure of speech, but Jim — if you're reading this — feel free to take it literally. We could use the help.*
