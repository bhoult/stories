# Chapter 13: The Pharmacy Run

On Day 15, we walked to the pharmacy.

I want to describe this honestly, which means I need to tell you what a supply run looks like when the supplies you need aren't weapons or ammunition but pills that suppress your ability to be afraid. In every movie, in every game, the supply run is a set piece — tactical gear, loaded weapons, a van with the engine running. Somebody says "let's move" and music plays and people do cool things under pressure. This was not that.

This was four people sitting in a church basement for two hours arguing about breathing.

"In through the nose," Jim said. "Four counts. Hold four. Out through the mouth, six counts. Feel the exhale longer than the inhale — that's the vagal brake, it downshifts the sympathetic nervous system."

"You learned that in Vietnam?" Marcus asked.

"I learned it from a counselor at the VA in 1978. She called it 'combat breathing.' I called it prayer with a timer. It's the same thing."

"It's not the same thing."

"Marcus, if it produces the same result, it's the same thing. We've been over this."

They'd been over it. This argument ran underneath every conversation like a creek under a road. Jim and I had fought it to a draw. Marcus opted out by drinking bourbon. Dale by carving. Sienna by running push-ups until her arms shook — exhausted muscles don't produce the same stress cascade as rested ones. We all got to the same place by different roads. The organism didn't care about the road.

The plan was simple because complicated plans produce anxiety. Marcus and Jim would walk eight blocks east on Maple Street to the Ozark Family Pharmacy. Sienna and I would watch from the steeple. Ruth, Dale, and Maria would stay in the basement. If anything went wrong — if Sienna or I saw the walkers in trouble — we would do nothing. That was the plan. Do nothing. Because running to help was the most natural, most human, most lethal response available, and the plan had to account for our instinct to be decent, and the way it accounted for it was by forbidding it.

We did have one contingency. The hand-crank radio from Henderson's house was positioned on the church roof, wedged against the steeple base where it wouldn't blow off. If Jim and Marcus got into trouble, Sienna would climb out and crank it. Continuous noise, loud, from an elevated position two blocks away. The hymnal experiment had shown thirty seconds of attention from a single sound. A sustained broadcast should buy longer — enough for two men to change direction, take a side street, disappear. It wasn't much. It was what we had.

Dale, from his chair, said something that had nothing to do with the pharmacy and everything to do with the question Marcus had planted two days earlier. "What if we trapped one?"

The planning paused.

"Not killed," Dale said. His knife was moving — he was working on the turtle now, the shell taking shape in careful symmetry. "Trapped. Lure one into a room. Lock the door. Watch what it does. Does it call? Does it try to escape? Does it sit down and do the thing it was doing before, like nothing changed?" He looked up. "Because if it calls — if trapping one brings the others — then killing one probably does too. And if it doesn't call, then maybe a single Turned separated from the group behaves differently. Maybe there's something to learn."

Maria's eyes had the calculating look. "That's also how you'd test whether they can be sedated. Isolate one, administer a dose, observe the response."

Jim was uncomfortable — I could see it in the way his hands pressed together. But he didn't object. Observation wasn't killing. Containment wasn't violence. "After the pharmacy," he said. "One thing at a time."

The idea stayed on the table. Tabled, which in a small group is its own form of approval — the acknowledgment that the question deserved an answer.

Maria had argued against the mission entirely. "Jim has forty days of metoprolol. Ruth has twenty-five of atenolol. Dale has —" She'd paused, calibrating whether to say it. "Dale has his situation. We have time. Why risk two people for supplies we don't need this week?"

"Because we need them next month," I said. "And next month the Turned will be more numerous, more coordinated, and more hungry. The pharmacy is eight blocks away now. In three weeks it might be inside the perimeter of a swarm cluster. The window is closing."

Maria looked at me. She had an expression I was learning to read — the one that said *you're right and I don't like it.* "If Jim doesn't come back, we lose our moral center. If Marcus doesn't come back, we lose our navigator. You're spending irreplaceable resources on replaceable ones."

"The medications aren't replaceable. They're the only thing keeping three of our seven people below threshold. Without them —"

"I know the math, Nate. I'm the one who does the math." She turned to the pantry closet and adjusted a can of tomatoes that didn't need adjusting. "Go. But know the cost."

---

They left at 10 AM. Jim and Marcus. Two men walking east on a residential street in the quiet of an October morning that smelled like dead leaves and distant fire. Jim had one walkie-talkie clipped to his belt, volume low. I had the other in my hand, beside the binoculars.

Sienna was beside me in the steeple. The space was narrow enough that our shoulders almost touched when we both leaned toward the louvers. I was focused on the binoculars. I was also focused on the almost-touching, and it was making me worse at both.

"Your breathing's off," Sienna said.

"I'm fine."

"You're at sixteen breaths a minute. You should be at twelve."

"How do you know my breathing rate?"

"I can hear you. You're loud when you're stressed." She paused. "And when you're nervous."

I chose to interpret "nervous" as referring to the mission and not to the eighteen-inch gap between her shoulder and mine. I adjusted my breathing and said nothing and she said nothing and the silence had a lot of things in it.

Through the binoculars: Jim and Marcus reached the end of the church's block. Turned were visible — three on Maple, two in a yard on the cross street.

I keyed the walkie-talkie. "Three on Maple, north side. Two more in the yard on the cross street, east. You're clear on the south sidewalk."

Jim's hand moved to his belt — a brief acknowledgment tap, not a verbal reply. We'd worked this out beforehand: I talked, they listened. Every transmission was a risk — the radios were quiet but not silent, and we didn't know if the Turned responded to electronic sound the way they responded to human voices. So Jim and Marcus stayed off the radio unless they needed to. I was the eyes. They were the feet. The steeple and the street connected by twelve dollars of yellow plastic.

Jim and Marcus walked past the three on Maple. Steady pace. No eye contact. The Turned tracked them — that slow head-turn — and didn't approach.

Block two. A cluster of four Turned near a stop sign. I could see them before Jim and Marcus could — the elevation gave me a full block of advance warning.

"Four at the stop sign, block two. Tight cluster. Recommend the south side — give them twenty feet."

Marcus adjusted his path, giving them a wider berth — twenty feet instead of ten. Jim matched. The cluster tracked, didn't move. I could see Jim's lips moving. He was either praying or counting breaths. Possibly both.

Block three. Empty. The houses here were dark, curtains drawn. Some had doors standing open — the residents gone, fled or turned, the homes left behind with the casual incompleteness of interrupted lives. A garden hose still running, the water pooling in a driveway. A bicycle on its side in a yard.

"Block three is clear. No movement. Pharmacy visible ahead — two in the parking lot."

Jim and Marcus walked through the remnants and didn't look at them — because seeing costs something you can't afford.

Block four. The pharmacy was visible — a small building on the corner, glass front, sign that read OZARK FAMILY PHARMACY in green letters. The parking lot had two Turned in it. They stood near the entrance, not blocking it, just present.

Marcus stopped. He'd been steady for four blocks — his depression a chemical anchor — but now he stopped. I adjusted the binoculars. His hand was at his side, shaking. A small tremor.

"What's happening?" Sienna said. She couldn't see it without the binoculars.

"Marcus stopped. His hand's shaking."

"His flask."

"What?"

"He hasn't had bourbon in five hours. He rationed it for the walk — nothing beforehand, so his reflexes are sharp. But the rebound is hitting. Remember? Alcohol suppresses short-term, then the anxiety spikes. He's in the rebound window right now."

I watched Marcus through the binoculars. He was standing in the middle of Maple Street, fifty feet from the pharmacy, and his hand was shaking and the two Turned in the parking lot were watching him. Not approaching. But watching, with that tilt, that evaluation.

I keyed the radio. Kept my voice low, steady — the tone mattered as much as the words. "Jim. The two in the lot are watching but not moving. You have time. Marcus needs a minute."

Jim noticed. He turned back. He put his hand on Marcus's shoulder. I couldn't hear what he said — he didn't use the radio for it. But I watched Marcus close his eyes. Take a breath. Jim's hand stayed on his shoulder. They stood there for maybe thirty seconds — a pastor and a truck driver on a residential street at the end of the world, one man holding the other steady through touch.

Marcus opened his eyes. Nodded. They walked to the pharmacy.

---

The pharmacy had been looted.

The front door was broken — someone had put a rock through the glass in the first days. Inside, through the binoculars, I could see the mess: shelves knocked over, products scattered, the wreckage of a panicked raid. But as Marcus and Jim moved through the store, I could see what had been taken and what hadn't.

Gone: the narcotics cabinet, smashed open, emptied. The OxyContin, the Vicodin, the Xanax — every controlled substance that people knew by name and reputation, stripped clean. The antibiotics — amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin — gone, because antibiotics are the thing you know you need in a disaster.

Still there: metoprolol. Atenolol. Propranolol. Carvedilol. Bottles of beta-blockers sitting on shelves, undisturbed. Sertraline. Fluoxetine. Escitalopram. SSRIs, untouched. Clonazepam. Lorazepam. Anxiolytics, dusty and perfect. Buspirone. Hydroxyzine. The things that would have saved lives, sitting on shelves because people understood pain and didn't understand the mechanism that was killing them.

The right supplies were always there. Nobody took them because nobody knew.

Jim and Marcus loaded a bag. Through the binoculars I watched Marcus reading labels, selecting bottles, organizing by type. He was methodical now — the tremor was gone, replaced by the focus of a task. Jim kept watch. The two Turned in the parking lot had drifted to the far side, drawn by something to the east.

"Route's clear back to block two," I radioed. "The cluster at the stop sign has dispersed — one left, stationary. Recommend the same path, south sidewalk."

Jim's voice came through the static — the first time he'd transmitted. "Copy. Five minutes." The brevity was Jim: no wasted words, no wasted signal.

They made it back at 11:47 AM. Ninety minutes, round trip, for a walk that in the old world would have taken twenty minutes. Marcus came through the side door and set the bag on the folding table and unzipped it and inside were four months of beta-blockers, three months of SSRIs, two months of benzodiazepines, and a collection of anxiolytics that nobody in the church except me could pronounce.

"The narcotics were gone," Marcus said. "Everything people want to take was gone. Everything they needed to take was still there."

Ruth, descending the stairs, looked at the bottles. "That," she said, "is a metaphor for the entirety of the human condition."

Nobody argued with her.

That night Jim broke out a bottle of grape juice he'd been saving in the sacristy — communion supplies, the good kind, not the Dollar General brand — and poured small cups for everyone, and we toasted nothing and everything, and Maria said "to surviving" and Ruth said "to antibiotics" and Marcus raised his cup and didn't say anything because he was smiling and Marcus smiling was rare enough to count as a toast on its own. Dale carved a small pill bottle out of a chunk of two-by-four and put it on the shelf next to the beagle and the cardinal, and when I asked him why, he said, "Because we did a hard thing and lived, and that should have a shape."

We passed hours like that sometimes — not many, but enough. Enough to remember later. I don't narrate all of them because some things lose their meaning when you pin them down with words. But they happened more often than the fear, if I'm honest. The fear was louder but the ordinary hours were longer — the cups of grape juice, the chapters of the romance novel, the evenings where the only sound was Dale's knife and the hum of the emitter and someone breathing the way you breathe when you're almost asleep. They would outweigh the crises by a factor of ten. The journal doesn't reflect this because journals are biased toward events, and sitting together in a basement drinking grape juice is not an event. But it should be.

---

That evening I distributed the medications. Jim's metoprolol was replenished — months of supply. Ruth's atenolol, the same. Marcus got propranolol — as-needed, for when his flat affect wasn't enough and the grief underneath started pushing through. I set aside hydroxyzine — an antihistamine with anxiolytic properties — as a general backup for anyone whose stress started climbing. Everyone got a small emergency supply: two propranolol tablets each, sealed in sandwich bags, carried at all times. The apocalypse equivalent of a fire extinguisher — break glass in case of catecholamine spike.

Sienna looked at her two pills like I'd handed her a dead insect.

"I don't need them."

"Your resting heart rate runs twenty beats above Jim's. Your baseline is —"

"My baseline is managed. I run. I breathe. I do the box breathing you taught me. It works."

"It works until it doesn't. These are for when it doesn't."

She put them in her pocket with the air of someone humoring a child, and I knew she'd carry them and I knew she'd never take them unless the alternative was turning. Sienna trusted her body the way Jim trusted his God — completely, specifically, as a matter of identity. The propranolol wasn't medicine to her. It was an admission that the thing she'd built — the discipline, the breathing, the athlete's control over her own physiology — might not be enough. She wasn't wrong to resist that. She also wasn't wrong to carry them.

Dale was sitting in his chair, carving. The beagle was finished. The bird was finished — it was a cardinal, I realized, the details emerging from the wood with the specificity of a man who noticed things and expressed them through his hands instead of his mouth. He was starting on something new. A turtle, I thought. Something with a shell.

"There was no Suboxone," I said.

He didn't look up. "I know."

"Suboxone isn't a pharmacy medication. It's clinic-dispensed. The nearest clinic —"

"Fort Smith. I know." His knife moved. The wood curled. "Eighteen days is thirteen now. I've been counting."

I set a book on the table between us — the PDR, the Physician's Desk Reference, brick-thick, that Marcus had grabbed from behind the pharmacist's counter. I'd been through it already, cross-referencing everything we had against everything that could theoretically touch an opioid receptor.

"I looked at alternatives," I said. "Methadone — same problem, clinic-controlled, not stocked at retail pharmacies. Tramadol — we found some. It's a weak opioid agonist. It might take the edge off the worst physical symptoms, but it won't prevent full withdrawal. Think of it as a Band-Aid on a broken leg."

"I've taken tramadol," Dale said. "It's nothing."

"Loperamide. Imodium. High doses act on opioid receptors — they call it the poor man's methadone in some recovery circles. Helps the physical symptoms. Cramps, sweating, the GI cascade. Won't touch the anxiety, which is —"

"Which is the part that kills me. In this context. Yes."

"And kratom, theoretically, if we could find a head shop, but the risk of a supply run to —"

"The risk isn't worth the payoff. I know kratom. It's inconsistent, under-dosed, and the withdrawal from kratom itself is its own nightmare." He set the knife down. "You researched all this."

"I research everything. It's the thing I do instead of being useful." The words came out before I could stop them — the self-deprecation, the joke, the deflection Sienna had named two days ago. I heard it and for the first time I heard what she heard: not humility but armor.

Dale looked at me. "The reason Suboxone matters — do you actually understand, pharmacologically?"

"Partial agonist with a ceiling effect. It occupies the opioid receptors enough to prevent withdrawal without producing a high. The ceiling means you can't overdose on it the way you can with full agonists. Nothing at that pharmacy replicates that balance. Everything is either too weak to prevent withdrawal or too strong to be safe without medical supervision."

"So there's no substitute."

"There's no substitute. There's bridging. Propranolol for the heart rate spikes. Clonazepam for acute anxiety — carefully, because benzodiazepines have their own dependency risk. And breathing. Jim's technique."

Dale picked up the knife. He was quiet for a long time. The wood curled.

"In recovery," he said, "they say 'the only way out is through.' I always thought that was cheap wisdom. Something you stitch on a pillow." He turned the carving in his hands. "Turns out it's just accurate. We bridge with what we have. Propranolol, clonazepam, breathing. And when those aren't enough —" He shrugged. "Through."

He was quiet for a while. The knife moved. Then he looked up, and his eyes had changed — something rawer than acceptance. The eyes of a man who had spent six years learning that the thing you depend on always runs out, who had rebuilt a life around that knowledge, and was now watching it happen again.

"You need to be ready for what happens if 'through' isn't enough," he said. "You specifically, Nate. Because you're the one who thinks about contingencies and you're the one who'll know when I'm past the line, and if I cross it, I need you to get the others out of the room before I —"

He stopped. The knife was still. Maria, in the pantry closet, had her back to us but her hands had stopped moving.

"We have thirteen days," I said. "A lot can happen in thirteen days."

"Yeah." He picked up the knife. "That's what I'm afraid of."

**JOURNAL ENTRY #8:**

*If you want a one-sentence summary of why the world ended: people grabbed what felt urgent and left what was actually important because the important thing looked boring and had a name they couldn't pronounce.*

*I'm starting to understand my role: the eyes. The person who sees the pattern and calls it down to the people in the middle of it. It's not nothing. But it's not enough. It's never going to feel like enough.*

*Dale has thirteen days. "Might" isn't a word I'm comfortable with when the failure mode is losing a person. He's asking me to be ready for the version where his chemistry betrays him permanently. I need to be ready. I don't know what "ready" looks like.*

On Day 16 — the day between the pharmacy run and the stupidest thing I've ever done — Marcus answered his own question.

He didn't ask permission. Marcus wasn't a committee person. He'd asked the question on Day 10 and nobody had answered it and the silence had been eating at him the way the flask ate at him — a low, persistent hunger for resolution. So at 7 AM, while Jim was on morning watch in the steeple and the rest of us were eating cold oatmeal in the basement, Marcus put on his jacket and picked up the hand hatchet from the tool bag and went out the side door.

I know this because Jim radioed down. His voice was flat, controlled, the voice of a man watching something he couldn't stop. "Marcus is outside. He's walking toward the lot. He has the hatchet."

I was up the stairs in thirty seconds. Sienna was behind me. Through the binoculars I found Marcus — moving south across the parking lot, steady pace, the hatchet low at his side. He was heading toward the nearest Turned: a man I'd catalogued as "Blue Polo," one of the original sixteen, who stood near the parking lot entrance facing east with the standard vacant expression and the standard wrong smile.

"Marcus," I said into the walkie-talkie. "Marcus, stop. We don't know what happens."

He didn't respond. The radio was on his belt. He could hear me. He kept walking.

At twenty feet, Blue Polo tracked him. The head-turn — slow, automatic, the same tracking they gave Jim on his morning walks, the same passive monitoring they gave everything that moved. Marcus kept coming. Fifteen feet. The smile was there. The organism trying to herd, to convert, to do what it always did.

At ten feet, Marcus's pace changed. He was no longer walking past. He was walking *toward.* Deliberately. The hatchet came up.

I saw the shift.

It happened in the Turned's eyes first — a snap, like a lens focusing. The vacant drift locked onto Marcus with a precision that hadn't been there a second ago. Then the body changed. Blue Polo dropped into a crouch so fast it looked like his strings had been cut — but it wasn't a collapse. It was a coil. Low, weight on the balls of his feet, knees bent, and his hands came up. Fingers spread. Curled. Not fists — claws, the fingers hooked and rigid, the posture of something that had hunted before on worlds that weren't this one.

The smile was gone. What replaced it was *hunger.* A focused, predatory stare that tracked Marcus the way a cat tracks a bird through glass. The face wasn't vacant anymore. It was *intent* — every muscle taut, the jaw slightly open, the eyes locked and unblinking and radiating something older than human expression had words for.

Blue Polo rose onto his toes. And he began to move.

Fast. Quiet. Not the shuffling drift of a herder — a stalking, fluid advance, low to the ground, closing the distance on tiptoes with a silence that was worse than any sound. He moved like water moving downhill. Like something for which this movement was natural, practiced, ancient.

Then the bark. Short. Sharp. A single percussive sound that came from Blue Polo's chest, not his throat — a vibration that carried across the parking lot and hit the other Turned like a switch being thrown.

Three of them dropped into the same crouch. Same claws. Same hungry focus. The nearest was fifty yards away and she covered twenty of those yards in the time it took me to process what I was seeing — on her toes, silent, hands up, fingers curled, closing on Marcus from the east while Blue Polo closed from the south.

"Marcus, *run!*" I said it into the radio and out loud and neither was loud enough.

Marcus swung. The hatchet connected — a single downward strike to the base of Blue Polo's skull, the kind of blow you give a fence post with a splitting maul. The impact made a sound I don't want to describe. Blue Polo dropped. He dropped the way a person drops — instantly, totally, the body going from animate to inanimate in the space between one heartbeat and the absence of the next.

He died like a person. The organism made him move like a predator and sound like something from another world, but he died like a man. The body that hit the gravel was a human body and the blood was human blood.

Marcus didn't have time to look at what he'd done. The three hunters were coming — fast, silent, converging from three directions on tiptoes with their claws up and their faces locked in that focused, predatory stare. Marcus turned and ran. He ran the way a man runs when the thing behind him doesn't need to breathe hard — flat out, no looking back, the hatchet still in his hand and his boots slamming the gravel and behind him the three hunters moving in that terrible fluid silence, gaining, gaining.

He made it to the side door with maybe five yards to spare. Jim had it open — Jim, who'd come down from the steeple in the time it took Marcus to cross the lot, who'd understood what was needed and been there, the way Jim was always there when someone was running toward a door. Marcus came through and Jim slammed it and the bolt engaged and outside I could hear them — not the drone, not the herding voices, but a sound I hadn't heard before: a low, continuous, focused breathing, three sets of lungs working in concert, punctuated by that bark, that short sharp coordination call, as they circled the building looking for another way in.

They circled for forty minutes. Then, slowly, the hunting posture faded. They straightened. The claws relaxed. The focused stare went vacant. One by one they drifted back to their positions and resumed the standard herding posture — smiling, swaying, faces to the sun, as if nothing had happened. As if their bodies hadn't just been something else entirely.

---

The hatchet sat on the church steps. Nobody picked it up.

The blade was dark with blood that was already drying in the October air. Marcus had dropped it on his way through the door and it lay on the concrete like an accusation. Maria was the first to address it.

"Is it transmissible?" she said. "Through blood. Through skin contact. If the organism is in the host's circulatory system —"

Nobody knew. Marcus was sitting on a pew, breathing hard, his hands on his knees. His right hand — the hatchet hand — had blood on the knuckles and the wrist. He'd already poured bleach water over it, the kind of thorough, panicked scrubbing that accomplishes everything chemically and nothing psychologically.

"We need to assume it could be," I said. "Until we know otherwise, Turned blood is a biohazard. Contact with broken skin, mucous membranes, open cuts — any of those could be a transmission route."

"We don't know that," Marcus said. His voice was flat.

"We don't know it isn't. And the cost of being wrong is conversion through a cut instead of through fear. A new vector."

The room was quiet. We'd added a new fear to the collection. Not just turning from panic. Turning from a scratch. From a splash of blood. From the hatchet sitting on the church steps.

Dale picked up the hatchet with a dish towel — carefully, not touching the blade — and carried it to the backyard. He burned the wooden handle. Maria boiled the steel head in the church kitchen's largest pot for thirty minutes. She checked Marcus's blood pressure every hour for the rest of the day. 118/76. 120/78. 116/74. Normal. Normal. Normal.

But normal vitals didn't mean safe. Not yet.

That afternoon, from the steeple, I watched what the Turned did with the body.

It took about three hours. The herders had drifted back to their positions after the hunting posture faded — all except two. These two knelt beside Blue Polo's body where it lay on the gravel, and they ate. Not frenzied. Not the swarm behavior. Methodical. Directed. The hunting mode applied to something that couldn't run. They pulled and tore with their hands, working through the soft tissue with an efficiency that said the organism had done this before, on other worlds, with other hosts. A third joined after twenty minutes, drawn by the behavior or the scent.

By late afternoon, what remained on the gravel was mostly skeletal. Bones, tendons, the durable architecture of a human body stripped of everything the organism could metabolize. The three feeders drifted back to their positions, faced the sun, and resumed the standard herding posture as if nothing had happened. The bones stayed on the gravel. Nobody went to collect them. The organism disposed of its dead by consuming them.

I watched the whole thing. I watched because watching was what I did and because looking away felt like a betrayal of the man Marcus had killed — the man who had coached Little League, the man Jim called Gary Sutton, the man whose bones were now scattered in a church parking lot because Marcus had wanted to answer a question and the answer was worse than the question.

In the steeple that evening, I wrote in the notebook:

*Marcus killed a Turned today. It died like a person. But the organism detected his approach before he was close enough to swing. At ten feet, the Turned shifted — dropped into a crouch, hands up, fingers curled like claws, rose onto its toes and came at Marcus in a stalking run that was silent and fast and nothing like the shuffling drift of the herders. The smile was gone. What replaced it was a predator. The bark brought three others and they all did the same thing — same crouch, same claws, same silent stalking advance.*

*The organism read Marcus before Marcus reached it. Not the hatchet — the approach. The deliberateness. A person walking past doesn't trigger it. A person walking toward it with intent does. The herding posture is a mask. Underneath it the organism is a predator wearing a person like a suit, and it has been reading predator approaches for longer than humans have existed.*

*One-by-one elimination isn't a strategy. You can't sneak up on something that sees you coming. And even if you land the blow — Marcus did — the bark fires before the body falls. Every kill broadcasts your location to every Turned within earshot, and the ones that come aren't herders. They're hunters.*

*The hatchet is boiled. The blood is cleaned. Marcus's vitals are normal. We don't know if that means anything. We don't know if the organism transmits through blood. We don't know a lot of things. What we know is this: the Turned can be killed. They die like people. And the organism has infrastructure-level defense against individual elimination — a defense that turns every kill into a recruitment call for something worse than what you just killed.*

*And afterward, the organism eats its dead. Three Turned knelt beside the body and consumed it over three hours. Methodical. Efficient. What's left is bones. The organism wastes nothing. The dead become calories for the living. The system is closed — self-sustaining, self-fueling, and designed from the ground up to turn every loss into a gain.*

*The organism has thought about this longer than we have.*
