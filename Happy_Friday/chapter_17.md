# Chapter 17: Committee Meeting

Two days after the Lyles, we held a meeting that lasted four hours and resolved almost nothing, because the apocalypse has not simplified human social dynamics even slightly.

The meeting was in the basement. Eight people around a folding table: Jim at the head because he was the pastor and it was his church and some structures persist even when the world they were built for doesn't. Ruth to his right, Bible on the table in front of her like a gavel. Marcus to his left, flask in his jacket but not out — he hadn't drunk in two days, the pharmacy's anxiolytics replacing the bourbon in a transition Maria had orchestrated whether Marcus wanted her to or not. Dale and Maria together, Dale's hands empty because he'd left the carving in the sanctuary with Caleb, who was building a small zoo of wooden animals on a pew. Caleb had two jobs now — the zoo and the chickens. We'd found them three days after Sienna brought him in: three hens in a backyard coop two houses down on Birch, alive and indignant, surviving on weeds and beetles and the grit of animals too stupid to know the world had ended. Caleb fed them every morning — scraps from the pantry, water from the rain barrel — with the solemn focus of a surgeon. He'd named them Triceratops, Steggy, and Rex. The names were non-negotiable. The chickens did not care what they were called. They cared about the scraps. Caleb cared about being needed by something that wasn't afraid of him, and the chickens provided this because chickens are afraid of everything except the person holding food.

I had, briefly, tried to discuss the chickens' tactical applications with Sienna. The organism responded to sound; chickens produced sound involuntarily and at volume; therefore, a chicken released at a strategic distance could function as an auditory decoy, drawing Turned attention while —

Sienna looked at me the way you look at someone who has suggested using a child's pets as military ordnance. She didn't say anything. She just looked. Then she walked away. The conversation was over.

I stand by the logic. The logic was sound. I am never bringing it up again.

Sienna across from me, her chair pushed back slightly, one foot on the floor, the posture of someone who might need to stand up quickly.

And me. At the end of the table with the notebook and a pen and the binoculars hanging from my neck because they lived there now.

"We need to talk about leaving," I said.

Jim's jaw tightened. 

I opened the notebook. I'd prepared for this — drawn a diagram, assembled the observations, organized the argument the way you'd organize a presentation. Persuading people to leave the only safe place they'd known for three weeks required data.

"Four things have changed since the Lyles fell."

---

**One.** The Turned count near the church was rising.

"Before the Lyles, we had sixteen in our immediate area. The morning after the swarm, I counted seven — the roar pulled the rest north. Seven damaged Turned, some of them barely functional. For about twelve hours it looked like the swarm had done us a favor." I paused. "It hadn't. The Turned that converged on the Lyles' house came from a six-block radius — blocks we thought were empty. After the frenzy burned out, they dispersed, but they didn't go back where they came from. They redistributed according to caloric availability and habitat, and this neighborhood has both. As of this morning, twenty-three. More than before. The Lyles' swarm didn't just destroy their house. It seeded our perimeter with Turned we'd never tracked."

Ruth: "You're saying their death made us less safe."

"Their death made everyone in this area less safe. The Turned don't go home. They redistribute, and this neighborhood has everything they need — the Walmart, the gardens, the dumpsters, the water sources. Every day the density increases. And density isn't just a comfort problem. It's a trigger."

I looked around the table.

"You all heard the roar. That sound — the one that shook the windows — that was the threshold. The organism has a mode specifically designed to destroy fortified positions. When the count around a structure hits critical, the roar fires, and what follows is a demolition. Not coordinated. Not strategic. Just bodies against walls until the walls come down. Craig had plywood, brick, a generator, guns, and military training. The organism erased his house in forty-three minutes." I let that sit. "The church is the second-largest intact structure in the neighborhood. We're on the same trajectory the Lyles were. We're just earlier on the curve."

---

**Two.** The hunting behavior was escalating.

"Marcus already showed us what happens when you approach one with intent — the crouch, the bark, the others closing in. We all heard the same thing at the Lyles' house when Brett started shooting. Hunting mode. We've known about it for a week." I turned a page. "What's changed is the trigger. Marcus triggered it with a hatchet. Brett triggered it with a shotgun. Threat. But now I'm seeing the same behavior without any threat at all. They're hunting because they're *hungry*."

I turned a page.

"They're not just herding anymore. I've been watching the patrol patterns from the steeple and they've shifted. Two weeks ago, the Turned near the church drifted — aimless circuits, no apparent purpose. Now they're checking doors. Systematically. A Turned man I've been tracking — the one in the Carhartt jacket, from across Highway 21 — spent thirty minutes yesterday working his way down the block, pushing on every door, testing every window. He's shed the jacket entirely now — bare from the waist up, the jacket folded on the ground near his usual position. The organism folded it. Whatever is driving them to remove clothing, it's deliberate, not decay."

I turned a page.

"When he found an unlocked door, he went inside. He was inside for about ten minutes. He came out carrying something — I couldn't see what. Food, probably. And here's the thing that changes the model: when he came out, he made the bark. The same sound that brought four hunters down on Marcus. Two other Turned, a block away, immediately oriented and moved toward the house. They went inside. The three of them foraged together for another twenty minutes. Not because someone threatened them. Because there was food and the bark said *come eat.*"

"So it's not just defensive," Marcus said. His hand was on the table, flat, the way it got when he was processing something. "The bark at the Lyles' — that was them reacting to a gun. This is them... coordinating a grocery run."

"Same mode. Different trigger. And the new trigger is worse because it doesn't require us to do anything. We don't have to approach them. We don't have to fire a shot. They're entering hunting mode on their own now, because the easy food is gone."

I turned another page.

"Yesterday afternoon, I watched a Turned woman kill a cat in the parking lot."

The table was quiet.

"A stray. Tabby. It had been living in the dumpster enclosure. She cornered it — methodically, between the dumpster and the fence — and she killed it and she ate it. Not frenzied. Not the swarm behavior. Hunting. A single Turned individual solving a caloric problem." I paused. "The cat scratched her. Clawed her arm, deep. And when it scratched her, she made the bark — and the Carhartt man, fifty yards away, turned and started walking toward her. She'd been attacked and the sound came out like a reflex. Like a dinner bell and a distress call at once. He arrived, saw the cat was dead, and went back to his patrol. But the implication —"

"If you fight one of them," Sienna said, "the sound brings more."

"And the ones that come aren't herding. They're hunting. Directed, aggressive, food-motivated. Every act of self-defense against a single Turned potentially activates every Turned within earshot as hunters."

Dale's empty hands were still.

"The Walmart is nearly stripped. The gardens are eaten. The garbage has been picked through. The easy food is running out. When the easy food is gone — and it's going, faster than I expected — hunting becomes the primary behavior. Not herding, not swarming. Hunting. And hunting doesn't require them to scare you. It doesn't require your adrenaline. It just requires them to find you."

Maria, from her chair: "You're saying the medication doesn't protect us from this. The beta-blockers keep us below conversion threshold. They don't do a thing against something that wants to *eat* us."

"Exactly. Conversion and predation are different threats and we've been treating them as one, and the error is going to cost us if we don't update the model."

---

**Three.** The adaptation clock.

"The Turned are getting smarter. Not individually — collectively. The organism's coordination is tighter every week. Three weeks ago, the Turned near the church stood in their positions like mannequins. Now they patrol. They check doors. They forage in organized rotations. Last week the Carhartt man found the church's rain barrel and drank from it for five minutes, and when he was done he went back to his position. He knows where our water is. He knows where we are."

Jim: "He's always known where we are."

"He's always known we're here. What's changed is that he's acting on it. The organism is moving from passive awareness to active engagement, and the engagement isn't about fear anymore. It's about resource optimization. We are a resource."

---

**Four.** The medication clock.

"Jim has thirty days of metoprolol at current dose. Ruth has eighteen days of atenolol. The pharmacy run bought time, but not enough — and there isn't another pharmacy in safe range. Dale's Suboxone is at ten days. When it runs out, his withdrawal will spike his catecholamines and he'll need to be managed with propranolol and benzodiazepines, which are stopgaps, not solutions. The medications are a bridge. We need the bridge to reach somewhere."

I closed the notebook.

"Dr. Moss is in Fayetteville. She has data. She has medication — she's mentioned a supply in her broadcasts. She has a frequency that disrupts the Turned's coordination. She has the one thing we don't have: a plan beyond next week. Every day we stay here, every clock gets closer to zero. The density rises. The food depletes. The medications diminish. The organism adapts. We can stay and watch the numbers converge, or we can go."

---

The discussion took three hours.

I'm not going to recount all of it because most of it was circular — frightened people trying to reach consensus about a terrifying decision. Every objection looped back to the same core: *here is safe and out there is not.* And every response looped back to the same counter: *here is safe now and won't be soon.*

Before the leaving debate consumed everything, Marcus put the kill question on the table. Formally, this time.

"I answered my own question," he said. "You can kill them. They die like people. But you can't kill them *quietly.*"

We'd been talking about hunting in the abstract — steeple observations, patrol patterns, the Carhartt man checking doors. Marcus put a body on it. Dale's hands were still. Ruth's novel was closed. Jim listened with his eyes down.

"The organism detected me before I was in range," Marcus said. "Ten feet out, the thing changed. Dropped into a crouch, hands up like claws, came at me on tiptoes — fast, silent. Not the shuffling. Something else entirely. Then it made a sound — the bark — and three more shifted into the same thing. Four predators, closing on me from different angles. I got one. I almost didn't get back."

"So one-by-one elimination is off the table," Maria said.

"It's worse than off the table. It's a recruitment strategy. Every kill triggers the bark. The bark converts every herder in earshot into a hunter. You go out to reduce their numbers and you increase the number of the *worst kind.*"

"What about trapping?" Dale asked. He hadn't forgotten. "Isolate one, contain it, study it."

"The approach triggers the shift," I said. "If you're walking toward one with intent — with a rope, a net, anything that signals 'I'm here to interact with you' — it reads the approach the same way it read Marcus. The organism doesn't distinguish between killing intent and capturing intent. It distinguishes between passive proximity and deliberate approach."

"So we can't kill them and we can't catch them," Ruth said. "What exactly can we do?"

Maria leaned forward. Her voice had the quality it got when she'd finished calculating and was about to deliver the answer. "We can use them."

The table was quiet.

"Every behavior they have is a response to a stimulus. Herding responds to human proximity and fear. Hunting responds to the bark and to deliberate approach. Swarming responds to density. Every response is predictable. Every predictable response is a lever." She looked around the room. "The question isn't 'can we kill them.' The question is 'can we make their own behavior work against them.' Craig tried to fight them with guns and the fighting is what killed him. But what if you didn't fight? What if you just... arranged the furniture?"

The room was processing this — shifting from "can we destroy them?" to "can we redirect them?" Maria had arrived at the same place I'd reached in the steeple, watching the roof come down. Different direction: behavioral engineering instead of physics.

"She's right," I said. "The organism is predictable. It responds to stimulus the way a machine responds to inputs. If we map the inputs — sound triggers herding attraction, deliberate approach triggers hunting, density triggers swarming — then we can manipulate the outputs. We don't need to be stronger than them. We need to be smarter about where we put them."

Jim looked at me. He didn't say anything. But I could see him holding two things at once: the grief for what we were discussing and the recognition that discussing it might be the thing that kept his congregation alive.

We moved on. We formalized four protocols — four, not three. The first was the question of approach.

"Can we kill them?" was answered: yes, but the cost is catastrophic. "Can we trap them?" was answered: probably not without triggering the hunting response. "Can we use their behavior?" was answered: maybe. That "maybe" was the most useful word we'd produced in three weeks.

The second was newcomer verification — if we encountered survivors on the trail. Jim's coffee method, refined. The first gate was conversation at distance — twenty feet, no closer. Sienna's rooftop experiment had proved the Turned couldn't sustain real dialogue; they produced fragments, habitual phrases from their old lives, but couldn't track context or generate novel responses. Three questions was usually enough. If the person answered like a person — tracking the thread, responding to content, adjusting tone — you moved to gate two: fine motor tasks up close. Sipping from a cup, adjusting grip as the liquid cooled, the micro-corrections that degraded in Turned. Two gates. Anyone who cleared both was probably still a person.

The third was the watch rotation callback. "The watch rotation is the most important job we have," Jim said, "and nobody wants to do it because nobody wants to be the person who has to decide, in the dark, whether the person in the next pew is still a person." On the trail, with no basement and no walls, the watch would be even more critical. We'd sleep in shifts. The watcher would have the cuff and a flashlight and the worst job in the world.

The fourth was distraction doctrine. I laid out what we knew by type: "Herding Turned respond to sound and light — any stimulus that might mean a panicking human. A continuous noise draws them and holds their attention for thirty seconds to a minute. Hunters are harder — directed, problem-solving, noise works only briefly because they're already locked on a target. And swarmers —" I stopped. Everyone at the table had heard the roar. I didn't need to explain what came after it. "Swarmers are beyond distraction. Beyond everything. You saw what they did to a brick house with a man with a rifle inside it. The only distraction protocol for a swarm is *don't be there.*" The hand-crank radio would travel with us. Standard procedure for any high-risk movement: position a noise source away from the group's path before proceeding.

The loops intersected and diverged and re-intersected and at one point Ruth and Maria had a disagreement about food rationing that was actually a disagreement about whether leaving was an act of courage or an abandonment of everything they'd built, and at another point Dale said "I'll go wherever you need me to go" in a voice that was so flat and so steady that I realized he was already grieving his Suboxone and had made his peace with whatever came after, and that Dale's version of bravery was quieter and harder than any version I'd encountered.

Jim hated leaving.

Not on tactical grounds — Jim understood the math. He hated it because the church was his church and the neighborhood was his congregation and the Turned who drifted through the parking lot were people he had known, had baptized, had buried their parents and married their children, and leaving felt like abandoning them. Even the Turned ones. Especially the Turned ones.

"They're still people," he said. "Somewhere inside, they're still —"

"Jim." Marcus. Blunt, because Marcus was always blunt, and blunt was what Jim needed. "Don't forget the living so you can keep vigil over people who are already gone."

Jim's face went still. The expression of a man who has been told a true thing he'd been praying would not be said aloud.

"They're not gone," he said. Quiet now. "The organism is using them. But they're still in there. Their memories. Their voices. The things they knew and loved — the organism uses those things, which means they're still present, which means —"

"Which means the organism is a parasite and the hosts are not the parasite. Jim, I know. But a vigil doesn't save them and it won't save us and you know this. You knew it before I said it."

Jim sat very still. The basement was silent. Ruth's hand was on the table near his, not touching, present.

"I know," Jim said. And the two words cost him something I could see — a sagging, the weight of a concession that contradicted thirty years of pastoral conviction. He wasn't surrendering his faith. He was surrendering the part that said staying was the same as caring.

"When?" he said.

I looked at Sienna. She'd been quiet through most of the meeting — sitting on her instinct to act, letting the discussion happen. She looked back at me and I saw the same calculation I was running: how many days to prepare, how many days the clocks would allow.

"Three days," I said. "We need to plan the route, pack supplies, prepare Caleb. Three days."

"Where?" Marcus said. Though he already knew.

"Fayetteville. The University of Arkansas. Dr. Moss. Sixty miles through the Boston Mountains."

"That's insane," Marcus said.

"Yes."

"It's the best option."

"Yes."

He nodded. He didn't reach for the flask that wasn't there anymore. He just nodded.

---

That night, after the meeting, I couldn't sleep. I went to the steeple. The moon was up and the Turned were in their positions and the night was cold and windy — early November now, frost on the gravel, my breath visible. I sat in the observation post with the binoculars around my neck and the notebook on my knees and I didn't write anything. I just sat.

Below me, in the basement, I heard voices. Jim and Marcus, talking quietly. I didn't mean to eavesdrop. The steeple's acoustics funneled sound up from the stairwell, and their voices carried.

"That kid sees things I don't," Jim said. "I've been a pastor for thirty years and a soldier before that and he's connecting dots I can't even find."

"He's got no skin in being wrong," Marcus said. "No reputation. No training telling him what the answer's supposed to be. He just looks at the thing and describes what it is."

A pause. Jim's voice, quieter: "I've spent my whole life thinking I knew what courage looked like. He's making me wonder if I ever did."

Marcus: "Courage isn't what he's got. What he's got is something else. He can look at a bad situation and not flinch. Most people flinch. Most people's brains protect them from seeing how bad it is. His doesn't. I don't know if that's a gift or a wound."

"Maybe both."

"Maybe both."

I sat in the steeple and I didn't move and I didn't make a sound because the thing they were describing was the thing I was most afraid of. The thing in me that could watch the Lyles' house come apart and think about quarries.

The cold settled over me. Below, the Turned shifted in the parking lot, restless, hungry, learning. Twenty-three of them now. Twenty-three and counting.

In three days we'd leave this church and walk sixty miles through the worst terrain in the state: a seventy-two-year-old woman, a seven-year-old boy, a man in withdrawal, a pastor whose faith was cracking, a truck driver who missed his daughter, a girl who ran toward crying children, and me — a hundred and eighty pounds, winded on stairs, capable of looking at a house full of dead people and calculating the load-bearing capacity of a gravel cliff.

This was the team. God help us.
