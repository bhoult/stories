# Chapter 16: The Night the Lyles Fell

I watched them die.

I want to say that first because everything else I write about this night is going to be analysis, and the analysis is the thing I hide behind, and you should know — before I retreat into the numbers and the observations and the strategic vocabulary that keeps me functioning — that what happened to the Lyles was not a data point. It was three people dying while I watched through binoculars from a church steeple and did nothing.

I am going to describe it in detail because the detail is the thing that earns what comes after. If you're going to understand the decisions I make in the next two weeks — decisions that involve other people's lives, decisions I have no right to make and no ability to avoid — you need to see what I saw. You need to know what the threshold looks like. You need to know that I know.

---

Three weeks in. Day 21. The count around the Lyles' house had been climbing since Day 10 and I had been tracking it from the steeple with the obsessive precision of a kid who understands that numbers are the only language the universe respects.

Day 10: 22. Day 13: 27. Day 15: 31. Day 18: 38. Day 20: 44.

Day 21, 6 PM: 51.

The bullhorn had stopped — Craig had finally turned it off, maybe because of what I'd told him, maybe because the batteries died. The generator still ran. The lights still burned. The flag still hung. And the Turned still came, drawn by the residual signals — the electromagnetic noise, the human activity, the smell of food and sweat and fear leaking through plywood seams. Once a concentration starts, it sustains itself. The Turned attract more Turned the way a snowball rolling downhill collects mass. Craig could turn off every device in the house and it wouldn't matter now. The critical mass was already there. The system had its own momentum.

I told Jim at noon. "Fifty-one. The behavior's changed — they're circling, not standing. The spacing has compressed. I think tonight."

Jim closed his Bible. "I'll go talk to him."

"Jim, there's fifty-one of them around his house. You can't walk through that."

"I can walk through anything." He said it without arrogance. Simple faith, the kind that had carried him across Highway 21 every day for three weeks. And he was right — he could. The metoprolol and the belief and the practiced calm made him invisible even in crowds. But walking through fifty-one to deliver a message Craig wouldn't hear was a risk I couldn't let him take.

"What are you going to tell him that you haven't already told him?"

Jim looked at me. The look had sadness in it — not for himself. For Craig. For the inevitability I was describing.

"I'm going to tell him to leave. Right now. Walk out the back door. Leave the guns, leave the boards, leave the generator. Walk to the church."

"He won't."

"I know he won't. But I need to have said it." He paused. "There are things you do because they might work and things you do because you can't stand before God having not tried. This is the second kind."

He went. I watched from the steeple — Jim walking north through the residential streets, past clusters of Turned who tracked him and didn't engage, through the thickening perimeter around the Lyles' block, up to the porch. Craig came to the door. They talked. Three minutes. Craig shook his head. Jim put his hand on Craig's shoulder — the same gesture he'd used with Marcus at the pharmacy — and then turned and walked back. The Turned let him pass. Jim's calm was impenetrable and the organism had long since stopped trying.

He came back to the church and sat in his chair and folded his hands and said nothing, and the nothing he said was the loudest thing I'd heard all week.

---

It started at 9:47 PM.

I was in the steeple on night watch. The moon was three-quarters full — enough light to see the Lyles' house through the binoculars, three blocks north and slightly east. The Turned were massed around it, visible as darker shapes against the moonlit street, standing in a perimeter that was no longer a perimeter but a compression. They were packed tight — shoulder-to-shoulder in places, filling the yard, the street, the neighboring lots. Fifty-one that I'd counted by daylight. More had arrived after dark. I couldn't get an accurate count in the moonlight. Sixty. Maybe more.

The voices started.

Not the drone — not the summoning call. Voices. Human voices, coming from the Turned surrounding the house, directed at the house, at the plywood windows, at the people inside.

"Craig." A man's voice. Familiar cadence — someone Craig knew, a colleague, a friend. "Craig, come on out. It's all right now."

"Brett." A younger voice. Male. The tone of a teammate, a buddy. "Bro, open up. Coach wants to see you."

They were trying keys. The way the organism had tried keys at my door on Day 2 — testing familiar voices, familiar relationships, looking for the one that fit. I could hear the voices from the steeple, faint at distance, and even from three blocks away they were wrong in a way that raised the hair on my arms. Not because they were inaccurate — because they were too accurate. The inflections, the vocabulary, the specific turns of phrase that belong to specific people. The organism was using the memories of everyone who'd turned and it was deploying those memories with a precision that was indistinguishable from the real thing.

The voices multiplied. More of them joining in, a overlapping chorus of familiar names and familiar phrases, all directed at the house, all calibrated to find the crack in the Lyles' composure. I could hear — or imagined I could hear — Tammy's name being called by her sister. Brett's name in his girlfriend's voice. Craig's name in the voice of a dispatcher he'd worked with for twenty years.

Then one voice, clearer than the others, carrying across the night:

"Craig, honey? It's Mama. Come help me, baby. I fell and I can't get up."

Craig's mother. Helen Lyle. She'd turned on Day 2 — I had it in my notebook, one of the earliest entries, reported secondhand by Jim. She was eighty-one. She lived in a care facility on the south side of town. And now her voice — her exact voice, the voice of an eighty-one-year-old woman who said "honey" and "baby" and "come help me" in the specific cadence of an Ozark grandmother — was coming from the dark outside her son's boarded windows.

I don't know what happened inside the house. I will never know the full sequence — whether Craig broke first or Brett, whether Tammy tried to stop them, whether there was an argument or a silence or a prayer. What I know is what I saw through the binoculars:

The back door opened.

Brett Lyle came out with a shotgun.

---

The first shot was a flash and a boom that broke the night open. The sound rolled across the blocks between us and hit the church like a physical thing — I felt it in the steeple floor, felt it in my teeth. Brett was firing into the Turned — I could see the muzzle flash, strobe-light snapshots of the yard, of the shapes closing in from every direction.

The gunfire did what gunfire does. It drew them. More Turned, appearing from the dark, from between houses, from the blocks south and east and west, walking toward the sound with that steady, patient pace. The count spiked. Sixty, seventy — I couldn't count, the moonlight wasn't enough, they were a dark tide flowing toward the house from every direction and Brett was shooting and reloading and shooting and the shots were doing nothing except feeding the signal.

Craig came out. I saw him through the binoculars — sheriff's jacket, rifle, taking a position at the corner of the house. He was firing controlled shots, the discipline of twenty years, and his discipline was the thing killing him because every controlled shot drew more and the more he drew the more he fired and the loop was closing.

Tammy was in the doorway. I could see her silhouette. She was not shooting. She was standing in the door frame and I think — I will never be sure — that she was trying to pull them back inside. That she'd heard what I'd told them and had done the math that Craig couldn't do because Craig's training was louder than her math and Brett's courage was louder than both.

The count hit critical.

I saw it happen. Through the binoculars, in the moonlight, I saw the change. It was like watching water go from liquid to boil — a phase transition, sudden and total. The Turned surrounding the house had been in their herding mode: strategic, patient, using the voices, applying psychological pressure. Then something shifted. A ripple went through the crowd — a physical shudder, a synchronization of movement that traveled through the mass like a wave. The voices stopped. The drone stopped. Everything stopped for maybe two seconds.

Then they rushed the house.

Not walked. Not the patient two-miles-an-hour approach. A rush — dozens of human bodies moving at once toward the same point with a force that was not individual but collective, the way a wave is not individual drops of water but the ocean moving as one. They hit the plywood. The plywood held for about four minutes.

I timed it. I timed it because timing things is what I do when I can't do anything else, and the alternative to timing was feeling, and feeling would have meant screaming, and screaming would have carried three blocks and added my voice to the night and I could not, I could not, I could not.

Four minutes for the plywood. The boarded windows went in sequence — north side first, then east, then the front. I could hear the wood splitting from the steeple. Not individual boards — the collective force of thirty, forty, fifty human bodies pushing, pulling, tearing at the same barrier. The plywood didn't break along the screws. It broke along the grain. They were pulling it apart the way you'd pull apart bread.

The walls lasted slightly longer. Drywall is not a structural material — it's gypsum and paper, designed for interior finishing, not for resisting the sustained force of a swarm. I could hear it going — a crumbling, cracking sound, different from the wood, softer, more continuous. They were punching through it. Not with tools — with hands, with shoulders, with the blind mechanical force of bodies that felt no pain and had no self-preservation and could push until the thing they were pushing against gave way.

The roof section went last. I watched it — a corner of the roof lifting, separating from the framing as the Turned on the east side pulled the wall out from under it. The section collapsed into the house. Through the binoculars I saw it fall on at least six of them and they didn't flinch, didn't dodge, didn't react. The ones underneath were crushed or pinned and the ones who weren't kept tearing.

Brett's shotgun fired three more times during the breach. Then it stopped.

Craig's rifle fired once.

Then nothing.

The generator exploded at 10:31 PM. The fuel tank ruptured when the east wall came down — a flash, brief and orange, and then darkness. The fire didn't spread. There wasn't enough structure left to burn. The sounds continued for a while in the dark — tearing, crumbling, the unmistakable sound of a house being disassembled by a hundred human hands — and then those sounds faded too, and the night was quiet.

---

I sat in the steeple until dawn.

I didn't go downstairs. I didn't tell anyone. They knew — they'd heard the sounds, the gunfire, the collapse. Sienna came to the stairs twice and I heard her and didn't answer and she didn't come up. She understood that I was in a place she couldn't reach and that the place I was in required being alone in it.

Sometime before dawn I must have dozed, because Craig was alive. He was on the bullhorn, standing on his porch, and the words coming out were my rules — "Stay calm. Stay small. Stay quiet." — but read backward, scrambled, the syntax inverted so the meaning collapsed in on itself. "Quiet stay. Small stay. Calm stay." He was grinning — the wrong grin, the Turned grin — and reading from my notebook, holding it up, and the pages were blank. He read the blank pages into the bullhorn and the sound that came out was the drone, the summoning call, and the Turned were coming from every direction but they were coming toward *me*, toward the steeple, and the steeple was swaying —

I jerked awake. My hand went to my wrist. One hundred and six. I pressed my back against the louver frame and counted it down in the cold air, watching my breath cloud, watching the parking lot below where the Turned stood in their positions, watching the Lyles' house — the dark shape three blocks north — and the house was still standing and for one disoriented second I thought it hadn't happened yet, that the dream was the memory and the memory was the dream, and then the second passed and the house was rubble and the flag was in the mud and I was awake and Craig was dead and the steeple was not swaying.

At first light I raised the binoculars.

The Lyles' house was gone. Not damaged — gone. The structure had been reduced to a debris field: lumber, drywall, roofing, the wreckage of a life scattered across a lot and into the street. The American flag was in the mud, trampled, half-buried in plaster dust. The chrysanthemum — Tammy's chrysanthemum, in its clay pot by the front door — was crushed under a section of wall framing. The generator was a blackened ruin. The plywood was splinters.

The Turned had scattered. Post-frenzy dispersal — the same pattern I'd observed after the ranch house incident, but on a larger scale. They milled in the debris, dazed, their coordination dissolved, individuals drifting without purpose. Some of them were damaged — limbs at wrong angles, wounds that didn't bleed, the consequences of throwing human bodies through structural materials without regard for the body. They'd heal. The organism maintained its hosts. But for now they wandered through the rubble of the Lyles' home like sleepwalkers in a junkyard.

I saw three new faces among them. Two I recognized: Craig, still in his sheriff's jacket, standing in his own front yard with blank eyes and a smooth face. Brett, shirtless, blood on his arms that wasn't his, drifting toward the road.

I didn't see Tammy.

I looked for her. I scanned the debris, the yard, the street. I looked for her body — dead or turned. I couldn't find her. The house was too thoroughly destroyed, the debris too scattered. She was in there somewhere, or she'd turned and I couldn't identify her at distance, or — the thought I held and turned over and didn't quite let myself believe — she'd gotten out. While Craig and Brett were drawing the swarm's attention at the back door, she'd gone through the front. While the organism was focused on the guns and the shouting, she'd walked away. Slowly. Quietly. The way I'd walked back from Henderson's trailer. The way I walked everywhere now.

I had no evidence for this. Just the absence of evidence against it. Tammy had listened when I talked. Tammy had asked the right questions. Tammy had looked at Craig with the expression of a woman doing math her husband couldn't hear. Maybe the math had saved her. Maybe it hadn't.

I came down from the steeple at 7 AM. The group was in the basement. Jim was sitting with his head bowed. Ruth was reading her Bible — not her novel, her Bible, the pocket King James, and she wasn't reading for ammunition in an argument. She was reading it the way people read when they need something and don't know what. Dale was carving. The turtle was nearly finished. Caleb was asleep on a pew, curled around the beagle Dale had given him.

Sienna looked at me. I looked at her. I sat down on a folding chair and I put my head in my hands and I stayed like that for a long time and nobody spoke because there was nothing to say that was equal to what we'd heard in the night.

When I raised my head, Marcus handed me a cup of water and said "Drink this" in the tone of voice you use with someone in shock. I drank it. It tasted like nothing.

"Craig and Brett turned," I said. "I saw them. I couldn't find Tammy."

"Maybe she got out," Sienna said.

"Maybe."

Silence.

"We need to move," I said. "Not today. But soon. The swarm attracted Turned from a wide radius — they came from blocks we thought were stable. The redistribution will settle but the net density in this area just increased. And the church is the second-largest structure they haven't breached."

Jim looked up. His eyes were red. "Not today."

"Not today. But soon, Jim. We have to talk about this."

"Not today."

I let it go. Jim needed a day. We all needed a day. The Lyles deserved at least that — one day where the people who'd witnessed their death weren't already using it as a variable in a logistics equation.

I went to the steeple and sat in my observation post and opened the notebook and didn't write anything for a long time. Then I wrote two things.

The first was the one I'd show people:

**JOURNAL ENTRY #11:**

*I think I'm in charge now. Not like a leader — like the kid in group projects who ends up doing everything because nobody else will. The apocalypse is the worst group project of all time.*

The second I didn't show anyone. It's the thought that arrived while I was watching the roof come down — the thought I'm ashamed of because it arrived while people were dying, and it wasn't grief. It was analysis.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #11b (private):**

*When the swarm hit the Lyles' house, the roof section collapsed and took out at least six of them. They don't protect themselves. They don't dodge. They don't notice when the thing they're tearing apart falls on them. The frenzy makes them destroy everything in reach and "everything in reach" includes each other.*

*I keep thinking about this. What if the space they were in was worse? What if the structure was weaker, or heavier, or positioned over terrain that didn't forgive a collapse? The quarry off Route 7 — the one with the gravel cliffs that are always sloughing off sections. You wouldn't need to fight them. You'd just need to get enough of them in the wrong place and let physics do the rest.*

*I don't want to be thinking about this. But I am. And I think the reason I'm thinking about it is that nobody else will, because thinking about it requires you to look at forty human beings — people who were people, who had names, who had families — and calculate the mechanics of their destruction. I can do this. I don't know what that says about me. I'm afraid it says the true thing.*

# Chapter 17: Committee Meeting

Two days after the Lyles, we held a meeting that lasted four hours and resolved almost nothing, because the apocalypse has not simplified human social dynamics even slightly.

The meeting was in the basement. Eight people around a folding table: Jim at the head because he was the pastor and it was his church and some structures persist even when the world they were built for doesn't. Ruth to his right, Bible on the table in front of her like a gavel. Marcus to his left, flask in his jacket but not out — he hadn't drunk in two days, the pharmacy's anxiolytics replacing the bourbon in a transition that Maria had orchestrated with the quiet efficiency of a woman who knew exactly what chemical dependency looked like and had decided to manage it whether Marcus wanted her to or not. Dale and Maria together, Dale's hands empty because he'd left the carving in the sanctuary with Caleb, who was building a small zoo of wooden animals on a pew. Sienna across from me, her chair pushed back slightly, one foot on the floor, the posture of someone who might need to stand up quickly.

And me. At the end of the table with the notebook and a pen and the binoculars hanging from my neck because they lived there now, because I'd worn them for three weeks and they'd become part of my body the way glasses become part of your face.

"We need to talk about leaving," I said.

Jim's jaw tightened. "We discussed this."

"We postponed this. I gave you two days. We need to talk about it now, because the situation has changed and the change isn't in our favor."

I opened the notebook. I'd prepared for this — drawn a diagram, assembled the observations, organized the argument the way you'd organize a presentation, because persuading a room full of people to leave the only safe place they'd known for three weeks required more than conviction. It required data.

"Four things have changed since the Lyles fell."

---

**One.** The Turned count near the church was rising.

"The swarm that hit the Lyles drew Turned from at least a six-block radius. After the frenzy burned out, they dispersed — but they didn't go back where they came from. They redistributed. The net effect is a higher density across this entire neighborhood. Before the Lyles, we had sixteen in our immediate area. As of this morning, twenty-three. The Lyles' swarm didn't just destroy their house. It seeded our perimeter."

Ruth: "You're saying their death made us less safe."

"Their death made everyone in this area less safe. The Turned don't go home. They redistribute according to caloric availability and habitat, and this neighborhood has both — the Walmart, the gardens, the dumpsters, the water sources. Every day the density increases. We're on the same trajectory the Lyles were. We're just earlier on the curve."

---

**Two.** The Turned's behavior was changing.

"They're not just herding anymore. I've been watching the patrol patterns from the steeple and they've shifted. Two weeks ago, the Turned near the church drifted — aimless circuits, no apparent purpose. Now they're checking doors. Systematically. A Turned man I've been tracking — the one in the Carhartt jacket, from across Highway 21 — spent thirty minutes yesterday working his way down the block, pushing on every door, testing every window. When he found one unlocked, he went inside. He was inside for about ten minutes. He came out carrying something — I couldn't see what. Food, probably."

I turned a page in the notebook.

"Yesterday afternoon, I watched a Turned woman kill a cat in the parking lot."

The table was quiet.

"A stray. Tabby. It had been living in the dumpster enclosure. She caught it — she didn't chase it, she cornered it, methodically, between the dumpster and the fence — and she killed it and she ate it. Not frenzied. Not the swarm behavior. Just a single Turned individual solving a caloric problem. Crouched over it in the parking lot for maybe twenty minutes."

Dale's empty hands were still.

"The Walmart is nearly stripped. The gardens are eaten. The garbage has been picked through. The easy food is running out. When the easy food is gone — and it's going, faster than I expected — the Turned's behavior shifts from passive foraging to active hunting. The herding was about reproduction. The hunting is about calories. And the hunting doesn't require them to scare you. It doesn't require your adrenaline. It just requires them to find you."

Maria, from her chair: "You're saying the medication doesn't protect us from this."

"The medication protects us from conversion. It doesn't protect us from being found and eaten. Those are different threats and we've been treating them as one, and the error is going to cost us if we don't update the model."

---

**Three.** The adaptation clock.

"The Turned are getting smarter. Not individually — collectively. The organism's coordination is tighter every week. Three weeks ago, the Turned near the church stood in their positions like mannequins. Now they patrol. They check doors. They forage in organized rotations. Last week the Carhartt man found the church's rain barrel and drank from it for five minutes, and when he was done he went back to his position. He knows where our water is. He knows where we are."

Jim: "He's always known where we are."

"He's always known we're here. What's changed is that he's acting on it. The organism is moving from passive awareness to active engagement, and the engagement isn't about fear anymore. It's about resource optimization. We are a resource."

---

**Four.** The medication clock.

"Jim has thirty days of metoprolol at current dose. Ruth has eighteen days of atenolol. The pharmacy run bought time, but not enough — and there isn't another pharmacy in safe range. Dale's Suboxone is at ten days. When it runs out, his withdrawal will spike his catecholamines and he'll need to be managed with propranolol and benzodiazepines, which are stopgaps, not solutions. The medications are a bridge. We need the bridge to reach somewhere."

I closed the notebook.

"Dr. Moss is in Fayetteville. She has data. She has medication — she's mentioned a supply in her broadcasts. She has a frequency that disrupts the Turned's coordination. She has the one thing we don't have: a plan beyond next week. Every day we stay here, every clock gets closer to zero. The density rises. The food depletes. The medications diminish. The organism adapts. We can stay and watch the numbers converge, or we can go."

---

The discussion took three hours.

I'm not going to recount all of it because most of it was the kind of circular argument that happens when frightened people try to reach consensus about a terrifying decision, and the circularity is not a failure of the people but a feature of the fear. Every objection looped back to the same core: *here is safe and out there is not.* And every response looped back to the same counter: *here is safe now and won't be soon.* The loops intersected and diverged and re-intersected and at one point Ruth and Maria had a disagreement about food rationing that was actually a disagreement about whether leaving was an act of courage or an abandonment of everything they'd built, and at another point Dale said "I'll go wherever you need me to go" in a voice that was so flat and so steady that I realized he was already grieving his Suboxone and had made his peace with whatever came after, and that Dale's version of bravery was quieter and harder than any version I'd encountered.

Jim opposed leaving.

Not on tactical grounds — Jim understood the math. He opposed it because the church was his church and the neighborhood was his congregation and the Turned who drifted through the parking lot were people he had known, had baptized, had buried their parents and married their children, and leaving felt like abandoning them. Even the Turned ones. Especially the Turned ones.

"They're still people," he said. "Somewhere inside, they're still —"

"Jim." Marcus. Blunt, because Marcus was always blunt, and blunt was what Jim needed. "You're asking eight living people to stay and die so you can keep vigil over people who are already gone."

Jim's face went still. Not angry. Something deeper — the expression of a man who has been told a true thing he knew and had been praying would not be said aloud.

"They're not gone," he said. Quiet now. "The organism is using them. But they're still in there. Their memories. Their voices. The things they knew and loved — the organism uses those things, which means they're still present, which means —"

"Which means the organism is a parasite and the hosts are not the parasite. Jim, I know. But a vigil doesn't save them and it won't save us and you know this. You knew it before I said it."

Jim sat very still. The basement was silent. Ruth's hand was on the table near his, not touching, present.

"I know," Jim said. And the two words cost him something I could see — a diminishment, a sagging, the weight of a concession that contradicted thirty years of pastoral conviction. He wasn't surrendering his faith. He was surrendering the part of his faith that said staying was the same as caring. It was a smaller sacrifice than it sounds and it was enormous.

"When?" he said.

I looked at Sienna. She'd been quiet through most of the meeting — she had the instinct to act and had been sitting on it, letting the discussion happen, which was its own kind of growth. She looked back at me and I saw in her expression the same calculation I was running: how many days to prepare, how many days the clocks would allow.

"Three days," I said. "We need to plan the route, pack supplies, prepare Caleb. Three days."

"Where?" Marcus said. Though he already knew.

"Fayetteville. The University of Arkansas. Dr. Moss. Sixty miles through the Boston Mountains."

"That's insane," Marcus said.

"Yes."

"It's the best option."

"Yes."

He nodded. He didn't reach for the flask that wasn't there anymore. He just nodded, and the nod was the closest Marcus ever came to enthusiasm.

---

That night, after the meeting, I couldn't sleep. I went to the steeple. The moon was up and the Turned were in their positions and the night was cold — early November now, frost on the gravel, my breath visible. I sat in the observation post with the binoculars around my neck and the notebook on my knees and I didn't write anything. I just sat.

Below me, in the basement, I heard voices. Jim and Marcus, talking quietly. I didn't mean to eavesdrop. The steeple's acoustics funneled sound up from the stairwell, and their voices carried.

"That kid sees things I don't," Jim said. "I've been a pastor for thirty years and a soldier before that and he's connecting dots I can't even find."

"He's got no skin in being wrong," Marcus said. "No reputation. No training telling him what the answer's supposed to be. He just looks at the thing and describes what it is."

A pause. Jim's voice, quieter: "I've spent my whole life thinking I knew what courage looked like. He's making me wonder if I ever did."

Marcus: "Courage isn't what he's got. What he's got is something else. He can look at a bad situation and not flinch. Most people flinch. Most people's brains protect them from seeing how bad it is. His doesn't. I don't know if that's a gift or a wound."

"Maybe both."

"Maybe both."

I sat in the steeple and I didn't move and I didn't make a sound because the thing they were describing — the thing they saw in me — was the thing I was most afraid of. Not the organism. Not the Turned. The thing in me that could watch the Lyles' house come apart and think about quarries.

The cold settled over me. Below, the Turned shifted in the parking lot, restless, hungry, learning. Twenty-three of them now. Twenty-three and counting.

In three days we'd leave this church and walk sixty miles through the worst terrain in the state with a seventy-two-year-old woman and a seven-year-old boy and a man in withdrawal and a pastor whose faith was cracking and a truck driver who missed his daughter and a girl who ran toward crying children and me, who weighed a hundred and eighty pounds and got winded on stairs and could look at a house full of dead people and calculate the load-bearing capacity of a gravel cliff.

This was the team. God help us.

# Chapter 18: The Map

## ACT THREE: THE WALK
### *"The hardest thing I've ever done was go slow."*

---

Marcus spread a road map on the church floor.

An actual paper map — an Arkansas Department of Transportation fold-out from 2019, retrieved from the glove box of his truck two blocks east. The internet was a memory. GPS was a memory. The satellites were still up there, presumably, orbiting a planet that had stopped listening, but the phones that connected to them were dead and the infrastructure that served them was dark and the map on the floor was the most advanced navigation technology we had.

Marcus knelt over it with a carpenter's pencil, tracing routes. I knelt across from him with the notebook. Sienna stood behind me, looking over my shoulder, close enough that I could feel the warmth of her and I ignored this because I was focused on geography and not on warmth and I was lying to myself but the lying was functional.

"Here's us." Marcus put a dot on the map — the Arkansas River valley, south of the Boston Mountains, in the stretch of lowland between the river and the first ridgeline. "Here's Fayetteville." Another dot, northwest, on the far side of a dense contour cluster that represented the mountains. "Sixty miles as the crow flies. Except we're not crows. We're eight people, one of whom is seventy-two, one of whom is seven, and one of whom —" He looked at me. "Gets winded on stairs."

"I'm aware."

"Just making sure it's in the model." He turned back to the map. "The obvious route is I-40 west to Alma, then 71 north. Highway the whole way. Flat-ish. Fast."

"And impossible," I said.

"And impossible. Every highway interchange is a congregation point. I-40 funnels through the river valley like a cattle chute — the terrain pinches the road between the river and the bluffs, and every pinch point is a truck stop or a rest area or a gas station, and every one of those is a concentration of Turned. I drove through it three weeks ago and it was already bad. It'll be worse now."

"Back roads?"

"Better. But back roads connect to highways, and the connection points are where it gets bad. Also — vehicles."

"No vehicles," Sienna said. She'd heard Marcus's argument before, in the basement, but she repeated it for the room. "A car engine is the loudest thing in a silent world. Start a truck and every Turned in a half-mile knows where you are."

"Could we push a vehicle?" Dale asked. He was standing by the stairs, empty-handed — he'd left the knife and wood with Caleb. His hands kept flexing.

"Downhill, maybe, for short stretches. But the terrain between here and Fayetteville doesn't do 'short downhill stretches.' It does ravines and ridgelines and creek crossings that would stop a tank." Marcus traced a line on the map, north from our position, into the contour cluster. "The Ozark Highlands Trail."

Sienna went still.

"My dad hiked sections of it," she said. Quiet. The sentence had weight — her father, the man who'd driven to Oklahoma City to get Jaylen and hadn't come back. "He was a section hiker. He'd do weekends, ten or fifteen miles at a time. He took me once. I was twelve."

"What do you remember?"

"Ridgelines. The trail follows the ridgelines mostly — up and down, up and down, but the path stays high. Oak forest. Sandstone bluffs. You can see forever from the top." She paused. "I remember my dad saying the nearest road was sometimes ten miles away. That was the point. He went to get away from roads."

Marcus nodded. "The OHT runs through the Ozark National Forest. I've crossed it hauling timber loads — the forest service roads intersect the trail every ten, fifteen miles. Once you're up in the mountains, there's nothing. No population. No highways. No towns. The Turned congregate where people were. People weren't in the deep woods."

I looked at the map. The contour lines in the Boston Mountains were dense — tight switchbacks of elevation, creek drainages cutting deep V-shapes into the ridgelines. The OHT was marked as a thin dashed line, barely visible, threading along the ridge tops like a crack in a wall.

"It solves three problems," I said. "Population density — zero in the forest. Terrain advantage — the Turned's coordination is optimized for open ground and built environments. Dense forest with ravines disrupts the signal. And navigation — the trail is blazed. White aluminum markers on trees. We don't need a GPS. We need eyes."

"And it creates three problems," Marcus said. He wasn't arguing against it. He was completing the analysis. "Physical difficulty — the OHT gains and loses thousands of feet of elevation. Ruth can barely do a flat mile. Caleb is seven. You —"

"Get winded on stairs. You've mentioned."

"— will struggle. Second: exposure. It's November. The Ozarks in November mean cold nights, frost, possible ice. We have no tents. Limited clothing. A seven-year-old in pajamas." He looked at Caleb's sleeping form on the pew, visible through the stairwell. "Third: isolation. If something goes wrong on a ridgeline twenty miles from the nearest road, there's no help. No pharmacy. No shelter. Just forest."

"The alternative is staying here and watching the clocks run out."

"I know. I'm not arguing. I'm listing the ways we could die so we can plan around them."

---

The planning took three days. In those three days, the Turned count near the church went from twenty-three to twenty-six. The clock was audible.

**Day one: route.** Marcus and I disagreed.

I wanted the shortest path — pick up the trail at the nearest access point, a forest service road eight miles south, and take the most direct line northwest to Fayetteville. Shortest distance, fastest timeline. I had the map. I'd calculated mileage. I was certain.

Marcus looked at my route and said: "That section drops into Hurricane Creek valley. I've hauled loads on the roads above it. The drainage is tight, the hollows are deep, and if there's a herd in that creek bottom, you've got cliff on one side and water on the other and nowhere to climb."

"The map doesn't show any population in that valley."

"The map doesn't show a lot of things. The creek crossings flood in October — I've seen the water marks on the bridges, three feet above the road. The ridgeline above Hare Mountain is exposed for two miles with no tree cover. And every trailhead parking area is exactly the kind of place people would have fled to when the roads failed — a dead-end in the woods where you could hide your car. Those parking areas are going to be occupied."

"You don't know that."

"I know what panicked people do when they're running out of highway. I've been watching them do it for fifteen years. They take the exit. They follow the road to where it ends. They park and they wait. And now they're Turned and they're standing in a trailhead parking lot and your 'shortest path' walks right through them."

We argued. I argued with data. Marcus argued with experience. The argument was the first real authority clash in the group — the kid with the map versus the man who'd driven the roads — and it ended the way it had to end: I conceded. Not because Marcus pulled rank. Because he was right, and being right was more important than being in charge, and the distance between those two things was a lesson I was still learning.

Marcus's route was longer — an extra day, maybe two, approaching from the south on higher ground, avoiding the creek bottoms, staying on ridgelines with sightlines. Less efficient. More survivable.

"A map is a picture of a place," Marcus said. "It is not the place."

I wrote this in the notebook and underlined it.

**Day two: supplies.** Maria took command.

She had, in twenty-two days, turned the church's pantry from a disorganized food bank closet into a precision logistics operation, and now she applied the same ruthless accounting to the packing list. Calories per person per day: 1,800 minimum, 2,400 for the walking pace we'd need. Weight per person: fifteen pounds maximum for Jim and Ruth, twenty for Marcus and Sienna, ten for Caleb, who would carry nothing because he was seven and would need to be carried himself when the trail got steep.

I would carry twenty-five. Maria decided this without consulting me.

"You're the heaviest and the youngest besides Caleb. You carry the most."

"I'm the one with the worst cardio."

"Then improve your cardio. You have two days." She handed me a backpack — Marcus's canvas military surplus. "Start walking laps around the church yard. Now."

I walked laps. Sienna walked with me. We walked in loops around the church, the gravel crunching under our shoes, the Turned in the parking lot tracking us with their slow head-turns, and we walked and walked and Sienna set the pace and I matched it and my lungs burned and my legs ached and she didn't slow down and I didn't ask her to because asking would have meant admitting I couldn't keep up and admitting I couldn't keep up would have meant — well. I didn't want to admit it. Not to her.

"You're doing fine," she said, on the fourth lap.

"I'm dying."

"You're not dying. I've seen dying. You're just out of shape."

"Is this your version of encouragement?"

"My version of encouragement involves a stopwatch and a coach screaming at you from the infield. This is gentle."

We walked another lap. The Turned tracked us. The gravel crunched. My breathing was loud enough to qualify as a broadcast.

"Nate."

"Yeah."

"The Lyles are dead."

I didn't say anything.

"Three people are dead. You saw it coming. You told Craig. He didn't listen. And right now, in your head, you're building the version where that's not your fault. Because you warned him. Because he had a gun and you had a notebook. Because you're fifteen and you're fat and what were you supposed to do — you did everything you could. Right?"

"I did do everything I could."

"No. You did everything you were *comfortable* doing. You walked over there once, said your piece, and walked back. When he didn't listen, you filed it under 'not my problem' because you'd already decided you weren't the kind of person who could make someone listen. You decided that before you walked over there. You decided it before you decided to go. You decided it on Day One, when you sat at your window and watched Lisa Anderson get taken and said 'I'm fifteen and I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds' like those numbers were a verdict instead of a starting point."

I stopped walking. She stopped with me.

"I couldn't save Lisa Anderson."

"Maybe not. But you could have done something you hadn't already decided was impossible. You could have banged on the window. You could have thrown something. You could have screamed — not to save her, maybe, but to try, so that the trying was on the record, so that the next time you looked in the mirror you'd see a person who tried and failed instead of a person who calculated that trying wasn't worth it." She was breathing hard too — not from the walking, from the saying. "You keep using your body as an excuse. 'I can't run. I'm out of shape. I get winded on stairs.' But you also figured out the fear mechanism. You also read the textbook. You also walked to the Lyles' house and back through nine Turned. Your body does things, Nate. You just won't take credit for them because taking credit means taking responsibility, and taking responsibility means the next failure is *yours*."

"It was mine. The Lyles —"

"Yes. It was yours. And mine. And Jim's. And everyone's who saw what was coming and accepted Craig's 'no' like it was the end of the conversation." She looked at me and her eyes were fierce and wet at the same time. "In the best case scenario, Nate — the absolute best case — everything that goes wrong is your fault. Because if it's your fault, that means you had the power to prevent it, which means you have the power to do better next time. If nothing is your fault — if you're just a fat fifteen-year-old kid who can't run and can't help and can't change anything — then you're powerless. And you're not powerless. You're the person who figured out what's happening when the entire rest of the world couldn't. So stop building the case for why you can't do things and start building plans for how to do them better."

The Turned in the parking lot swayed. A bird — an actual bird, a real one, alive — crossed the parking lot and landed on the church sign. We stood in the gravel and my lungs burned and my legs ached and the thing Sienna had just said was sitting in my chest like a stone, heavy and cold and true.

"The old world could afford what you're doing," she said, quieter now. "The comfortable lies. The passive withdrawal. The *I'm not that kind of person* excuse. The old world had margins. Room for people to hide inside their own limitations and still survive. This world doesn't. This world consumes people who don't adapt. You know this. You wrote it in the notebook. You just haven't applied it to yourself."

I started walking again. She walked with me. The next lap was faster.

I laughed. It was the second laugh since before the Turned. She looked at me when I laughed and something in her expression shifted — surprise, pleasure, the brief illumination of a person who had forgotten that sounds like that existed. Then she looked forward and set a slightly faster pace and I matched it and my lungs burned worse and I was alive.

**Day three: preparation.** Jim held a final service.

Not in the sanctuary — in the basement, by candlelight, the eight of us plus Caleb's zoo of wooden animals lined up on the folding table. Jim read from Isaiah. Ruth sang — not "Amazing Grace" this time, but something I didn't recognize, older, simpler, a melody that felt like it had been composed in a room like this one, by people in a situation like this one, and maybe it had. Dale sat with his hands on his knees, still, the first time I'd seen him fully still without tension. Maria was beside him, her shoulder touching his. They'd been fighting about rationing two hours ago. Now they were touching. The distances people traverse in the space of an evening.

Jim prayed. The prayer was short: "Lord, we're leaving tomorrow. We don't know if we'll make it. But we're going because staying is the slower way to die and You didn't make us for sitting still. Walk with us. Or if You won't walk with us, at least walk ahead of us and flatten the trail for Ruth. Amen."

Ruth said, "The trail doesn't need flattening. I need better knees."

Jim said, "I'll pray for those too."

During the planning days Jim mentioned a dream. Casual, over coffee, the way he mentioned everything — as if the thing he was saying was less important than the act of saying it and the act of saying it was less important than the coffee.

"I dreamed about a woman in a lab coat," he said. "She was standing at a desk covered in papers — printouts, graphs, numbers I couldn't read. She showed me one of the printouts and said, 'The numbers are wrong but the math is close.' Then she took the printout back and corrected something and showed it to me again and said, 'Closer.'" He sipped his coffee. "She had kind eyes. Tired. The eyes of someone who's been working too long on something that matters too much."

I looked at him. "You've never met Dr. Moss."

"I've never met anyone in a lab coat, son. The closest I've come to a laboratory is the church kitchen, and Ruth's the only one running experiments in there." He smiled. "Probably just my brain filling in details. I've been listening to her broadcasts. The subconscious builds a picture."

He was probably right. The brain does that — takes scattered data and assembles it into narratives during sleep. It didn't mean anything. Except that Jim had described a woman at a desk correcting printouts, and when we reached the university five weeks later, Dr. Moss's desk was covered in exactly the printouts he'd described, and she did have kind eyes, and she did say something about the math being close, and Jim looked at me when she said it and said nothing, and I said nothing, and neither of us needed to.

Marcus packed the CB radio. He'd been listening every evening, catching fragments of Moss's broadcasts, confirming she was still there, still transmitting, still offering what she had. The last fragment, caught the night before: "— the frequency emitter has a range of approximately eighty meters. Within that radius, the Turned's collective coordination is disrupted. They become individuals again. Disoriented. Passive. The emitter buys time. It is not a solution. But time is what —" Static.

Eighty meters. A circle of safety in a world that had none. It was waiting for us on the other side of the mountains, and all we had to do was walk sixty miles through the most rugged terrain in the state at the pace of a seventy-two-year-old woman without anyone's heart rate crossing a line that none of us could see.

The last night at the church, Jim held a service. Not the brief candle-and-psalm services he'd been doing on Wednesdays — a real one. Hymns. A reading from Ecclesiastes. A silence at the end that lasted so long I thought he'd forgotten what came next, and then I realized the silence *was* what came next, and that the silence was the sermon.

Afterward, nobody went to bed. We sat in the basement and talked about things that had nothing to do with tomorrow. Ruth described her first year of teaching — the room she was given, the chalk that was always the wrong color, the principal who called her "dear" until she told him to stop. Marcus talked about Ava's birthday party and the purple frosting and how she'd insisted on a theme of "dogs in space" and he'd built her a cardboard rocket ship with a stuffed beagle inside. Maria said the filing system at the law firm was the only beautiful thing she'd ever created, and the way she said "beautiful" — serious, without irony — made everyone go quiet for a moment because she meant it.

Dale gave Sienna the cardinal he'd carved. She turned it in her hands, feeling the feathers he'd cut into the wood, and said, "My mom has a cardinal that comes to our feeder every morning," and Dale said, "I know. You told me," and I didn't know when she'd told him that, which meant there were conversations happening in this basement that I wasn't part of, which meant the group had grown its own connective tissue without me organizing it, and that was the best thing I'd learned in three weeks.

Sienna and I ended up on the stairs, which was our spot when we needed to talk without an audience. She had her knees pulled up, her chin resting on them. I sat one step below because the stairs were narrow and proximity required negotiation.

"I'm scared," she said. Not a confession. A measurement. The way she'd report a heart rate.

"Me too."

"Good. Honest people live longer." She bumped her knee against my shoulder. "We're going to make it."

"You don't know that."

"No. But I'm saying it anyway. And you're going to remember I said it on day three of the trail when your legs are gone and you want to quit. Deal?"

"Deal."

She went to the basement. I sat on the stairs for a while longer, listening to the sounds of people settling — blankets rustling, whispered goodnights, the small coughs and sighs that mean a room full of humans is transitioning from awake to asleep. These were the sounds of my congregation, and I use that word deliberately because Jim would understand it and because it's the right one.

I sat in the steeple one last time. The parking lot, the road, the trailer park across Highway 21. My trailer was still there — Lot 7, the one with the dented mailbox and the propane tank I'd knocked with my hip on the night of my first mistake. Somewhere inside it, on a shelf above the washer-dryer, *Brunner & Suddarth's Medical-Surgical Nursing* sat where I'd left it, open to the chapter on the autonomic nervous system, the passage about cognitive dissonance circled in pencil.

I wouldn't go back for it. The textbook had taught me what it could. Everything after this would be learned on the trail.

Tomorrow we walked.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #12:**

*Day 24. Eight people. Twenty-six Turned outside. Sixty miles ahead.*

*The route follows the Ozark Highlands Trail through the Boston Mountains. Marcus's route, not mine. His is longer and safer and he's right and I'm learning that being right about a map is not the same as being right about a mountain. "A map is a picture of a place. It is not the place." I'm going to tattoo this on my brain.*

*We carry: medications for forty-five days. Food for twelve. Water purification tablets. The CB radio. The blood pressure cuff. The notebook. Eight people's worth of fear and grief and hope and whatever Ruth keeps in the bottom of her purse that she won't let anyone see.*

*I am fifteen years old. I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds. I get winded on stairs. I have never hiked a trail in my life. I am responsible for seven people's survival because I'm the one who reads the patterns and nobody else wants the job.*

*The Turned are getting hungrier, smarter, and more numerous. The medications are running out. The church is a countdown. Fayetteville is sixty miles of mountain wilderness.*

*I am terrified. My resting heart rate is 68. The gap between those two facts is the only thing keeping me alive.*
