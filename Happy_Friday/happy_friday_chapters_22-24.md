# Chapter 22: Mom

Day 39. The highway was flat and empty and there was nothing to think about except the things I'd been refusing to think about for sixteen days.

The mountains were behind us. The trail was behind us. The roadblock was behind us — the razor wire and the woman tangled in it and the three hundred people I'd killed by borrowing a wolf-hunting technique. The fortified group was behind us — nine people in a gas station who wouldn't leave and who would die the same way the Lyles died and who I couldn't save. All of it was behind us and none of it was behind us because the things you carry don't care about geography.

Highway 71 stretched south in a straight line, flat, featureless, the kind of road that gives the mind nothing to hold onto. No switchbacks. No creek crossings. No rocks to navigate or hills to climb. Just asphalt and sky and the rattle of shopping cart wheels and the steady rhythm of walking that required no thought, no calculation, no analytical machinery at all. And when the machinery has nothing to process, it idles. And when it idles, the things it's been holding back seep through.

I was tired. Not the productive tiredness of trail days — the kind where you collapse at camp and sleep hard and wake stiff but functional. This was the other kind. The cumulative kind. The kind that builds in layers like sediment: weeks of insufficient food on top of blisters that had healed and re-opened and healed again on top of a month of sleeping on the ground on top of three hundred people shredded on razor wire on top of everything else. Everything else being: a woman in blue scrubs in a hospital parking lot in Clarksville, standing with bare feet and nothing behind her eyes. My mother. The sealed envelope I'd opened that day in the truck with Marcus and had been carrying open ever since, the contents visible, the contents unbearable, the contents following me through sixty miles of trail and thirty miles of highway like a weight that didn't register on any scale but was heavier than the pack.

The analytical machinery had been carrying it. That's what the machinery does — it takes the unbearable thing and converts it into data, files it, processes it into something manageable. The machinery had been running nonstop since Clarksville. Since the parking lot. Since I saw her face and Marcus kept driving and I said "I see her" and the words were data and the data was containable and the container held.

The container held through the first days on the trail, when the physical suffering was new enough to occupy the machinery's full capacity. Through the creek crossings and the gear discarding and the nightly inventory of blisters and the obsessive management of socks and the slow adaptation of a body that had never been asked to do anything like this. Through Dale's withdrawal peaking and breaking. Through the Rock House Shelter, where we'd slept dry and warm and I'd almost felt something like peace. Through the stray Turned hunter in the woods, nocking his invisible arrow, who reminded me that the organism took everyone — hunters and nurses, fathers and mothers, people who had been people. Through the roadblock, where I became the kind of person who engineers a wolf knife out of razor wire and walks through the results. Through the gas station, where I watched myself fail to save people for the third time and understood that the pattern would repeat forever.

The container held because the machinery was running. And on Day 39, on a flat stretch of highway with nothing to think about, the machinery stopped.

Not dramatically. Not a breakdown — not yet. Just a quiet failure, like a generator running out of fuel. One moment I was walking and processing and carrying the weight in its compartment. The next moment the compartment was open and the weight was everywhere — in my legs, in my lungs, in the flat grey light of a November afternoon, in the sound of my own breathing, in the empty highway that stretched in both directions like a sentence with no end.

I stopped on the highway. The group moved on for a few steps. Sienna noticed first — she always noticed first.

I was standing on the asphalt and I was not moving because there was nowhere to move to. Every direction was away from her. The highway went north to south but the distance that mattered was not geographical — it was temporal, irreversible, the distance between a kitchen where she poured coffee and a parking lot where she stood with bare feet, and no amount of walking would close it.

"Nate," Sienna said.

I looked at her. She was tired — they all were, the highway walking wearing everyone down in a different way than the trail had, the flatness and the monotony and the exposure grinding something that switchbacks and creek crossings at least distracted you from. She looked at me and she saw it. She always saw it. The thing behind the machinery, the thing the data was built to hide.

I didn't say anything. There was nothing to say. The highway said it for me — stretching in both directions, flat and empty and indifferent, the same in every direction, carrying the same nothing toward the same nowhere, and the emptiness was the truest thing about the world.

Sienna took my hand.

She had never done this before. In five weeks of proximity and argument and the slow accumulation of whatever we were becoming, she had touched my elbow twice and my arm once, each time brief and functional. This was different. Her fingers between my fingers. Her grip firm and warm. She was not letting go and she was not saying anything and she was holding me in the world by the specific physical fact of her hand.

We stood there. On the highway. Five minutes or five hours.

Then we walked on. Because walking was the only verb left.

---

I didn't write in the journal that night. I sat by the fire at the roadside camp and said nothing and ate nothing and everyone left me alone because they understood. Caleb brought me the wooden beagle and put it in my lap without a word and went back to Marcus's side.

Two days later I opened the notebook.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #16:**

*She would have been scared. At the end. She would have been so scared.*

---

That night I dreamed she was fine.

Not the parking lot version — the real one. The kitchen in the trailer, 6 PM on a Thursday, still in her scrubs because she'd worked a double and hadn't changed. Making coffee she shouldn't have been drinking that late. The radio on the counter playing something country and terrible that she loved. The particular way she leaned her hip against the counter while the pot brewed — the posture of a woman who had been on her feet for sixteen hours and was going to be on them for eight more because I had a dentist appointment in the morning and she wanted to make sure I ate breakfast before we left.

"Happy Friday, bud," she said.

And it was right. It was *her* — the voice, the cadence, the way the words carried the specific weight of a person who said them every week not because it was Friday but because the saying was a ritual and the ritual was love and the love was the thing she'd built our whole small life around. It was the realest thing I'd dreamed since the world ended. Not the nightmare versions — not the too-wide smile, not the Knock-voice bleeding through — just my mother, in our kitchen, saying the thing she always said.

I said, "It's Thursday, Mom."

"Close enough," she said, and smiled, and poured two cups, and the dream was so ordinary and so perfect that I would have lived in it forever.

Then I was outside.

Not a transition — just outside, in the parking lot in Clarksville, at night, and the trailer was the hospital and the kitchen window was a hospital window three stories up and she was standing behind the glass. Still in scrubs. Still holding the coffee. But her face was wrong — smooth, blank, the expression I'd seen on two hundred Turned and had seen on her, across the parking lot, the day Marcus kept driving. Her mouth moved. No sound through the glass. She put her hand against the window, palm flat, fingers spread.

I put my hand against the glass. I couldn't not. The glass was warm.

I woke walking.

I was ten feet from my sleeping bag, moving past the dying campfire toward the highway, and my heart was at 118 and I didn't know where I was or when I was or whether the glass had been real. My hand was still raised, palm out, reaching for a window that wasn't there.

I didn't go back to the sleeping bag. I couldn't. The dream was still in the air — not the nightmare part, the *good* part, the kitchen and the coffee and her voice — and going back to sleep meant either returning to it or losing it and I couldn't survive either one.

I took the binoculars and walked. Back up the highway. Back the way we'd come. Back toward Clarksville.

# Chapter 23: Nate Walks

*Third-person interstitial.*

---

Sienna woke at 3 AM and Nate's sleeping bag was empty.

They were camped in a highway pulloff — a wide gravel shoulder where truckers used to park, the shopping carts pulled to the side, sleeping bags laid out on pads in the shelter of a concrete retaining wall. The fire was built in the gravel and had burned down to coals that pulsed orange when the wind moved through. The group was scattered along the pulloff, the shapes of sleeping bodies barely visible in the dark. The air smelled like asphalt and woodsmoke and the particular cold of a November night on exposed highway.

Nate's sleeping bag was flat. His backpack was where he'd left it. His binoculars were gone.

Sienna didn't wake anyone. She pulled on her shoes, took the blood pressure cuff — habit, the cuff went everywhere now, pink and absurd and essential — and moved past the fire.

The night was cold. November on Highway 71, the air sharp enough to taste, the stars dense above the open road. She listened. Wind. The distant sound of something — an animal, or not — moving in the scrub beyond the shoulder. The sounds of an empty highway that she was learning to distinguish from the other sounds — the ones that meant something was wrong.

She heard footsteps. North. On the highway.

She found him a quarter mile from camp, walking. Not the careful, measured walk he'd taught them — the breathing, the slow pace, the conscious suppression of the body's emergency signals. He was just walking. In the dark, without a flashlight, without a plan, back up the highway the way they'd come. Back toward Clarksville. Back toward the hospital parking lot where he'd seen her from the truck, the woman in blue scrubs, the day Marcus kept driving.

She caught up to him. His face was blank in the starlight — not the analytical blankness he wore like armor, the one that said *I am processing data and not feeling.* This was different. This was empty. The face of a person who had run out of the thing that held them together and was operating on the last fumes of muscle memory.

"Nate," she said.

He didn't stop. Didn't acknowledge her. Kept walking.

She walked alongside him. She didn't touch him, didn't talk, didn't try to block his path. She matched his pace and stayed a foot to his left and let the silence be the thing between them. She'd learned this from watching him — the patient observation, the refusal to intervene until you understood what you were intervening in. He'd taught her more about stillness than he'd ever know.

They walked for five minutes. The highway was dark. The mountains on either side were dark. Somewhere to the north, thirty miles of highway and sixty miles of trail and twenty miles of road away, was the hospital parking lot and the woman in blue scrubs.

"Nate, she's not there."

He kept walking. Then he said: "I know."

His voice was flat. Two words, no inflection. The voice of a person who understood with absolute clarity that the thing they were walking toward was not the thing they needed and who could not stop walking toward it because the need was deeper than understanding, deeper than the analytical machinery that had kept him alive for five weeks, deeper than the rules he'd written in his notebook and the lessons he'd learned from failures and the carefully constructed framework of data-driven survival that was his version of a personality. The need was the animal at the bottom — the child who wanted his mother — and the child did not care about epinephrine thresholds or density calculations or the optimal strategy for surviving a world that punished love.

Sienna had watched Nate hold his composure through everything. The knock on the door. The septic tank. The Lyles burning. She had watched him see his mother's face in a parking lot and keep walking. She had watched him absorb horror after horror and convert each one into data, each trauma into a journal entry, each loss into a lesson. She had admired it and been frightened by it in equal measure — the capacity to feel everything and process it into something useful, the cold engine running behind the eyes of a fifteen-year-old who should have been doing homework.

She understood now that the engine had limits. That the processing was not the same as the feeling, and the feelings he hadn't felt were still in there, accumulating, pressing against the walls of the container he'd built for them, and the container had cracked — not from a single blow but from the slow grinding of weeks, the hunger and the blisters and the weight of three hundred dead people in razor wire and the weight of everything the notebook couldn't carry — and the crack was beyond repair.

She started talking. Not to convince him — to be present. To fill the dark with something that wasn't silence and wasn't analysis.

"My parents left on Friday night," she said. "Around eight. They were going to get Jaylen from my grandmother's in Oklahoma City. My dad said they'd be back by midnight. My mom kissed me on the forehead and said 'Lock the door.'" She paused. "I locked the door. That's the last thing I did for them. I locked the door."

Nate's pace slowed. Not much. A fraction.

"I decided three weeks ago that they're alive. Not because I have evidence. Not because the math supports it. Because the alternative is a thought I can't afford to have. If I let myself think they're dead — or turned — or standing in a parking lot somewhere in Oklahoma with blank faces and bare feet — then I can't function. I can't run. I can't carry Caleb. I can't be the person this group needs me to be. So I decided they're alive and I carry that decision like a lie I tell myself every morning and I know it's probably a lie and I carry it anyway because the lie is lighter than the truth and I need my arms free."

Nate stopped walking.

Not because she convinced him. Because his legs gave out. He sat down on the highway — just folded, the way a structure folds when the load-bearing element fails — and he was on the dirt in the dark and his hands were over his face and he was crying.

Not the controlled, silent crying from the night of the knock. This was ugly and loud and completely uncontrolled — the sound of a fifteen-year-old boy who had held everything together for five weeks through intelligence and discipline and the ruthless conversion of grief into strategy, and who had run out of conversion capacity, and who was now producing the raw sound of loss on an empty highway in the dark in a world where raw sound was the thing that killed you.

Sienna dropped to her knees beside him. She put her hand over his mouth. Not gently — this wasn't tender, this was survival, this was the same instinct that had made Nate bite his own hand on the night of the knock.

"Quiet," she said. "Quiet. I know. But quiet."

He couldn't stop. The sound came through her fingers — muffled, broken, the sound of something that had been sealed too long and was venting. She pressed harder. She put her other arm around him — the first time she'd held him, the first full-body contact between them, and it was not romantic and it was not comforting and it was the most intimate thing either of them had experienced because intimacy, in this world, was the act of keeping someone alive when they wanted to die.

"I know," she whispered. "I know. But quiet. Please. Quiet."

The crying subsided. Not because he was finished — because the body runs out before the grief does, and at some point the physical machinery of crying depletes its resources and the sound stops even though the cause doesn't. He sat on the asphalt with Sienna's hand over his mouth and Sienna's arm around him and he shook and didn't make a sound and the stars were cold above them and the highway was dark in both directions.

Marcus found them twenty minutes later. He'd woken, noticed the empty sleeping bags, followed the highway. He stood over them for a moment — two kids on the asphalt, one holding the other — and he didn't ask what happened.

He picked Nate up. This was not easy — Nate was not small, and Marcus was tired, and the act of lifting a hundred and seventy pounds off the ground required a physical effort that Marcus performed without comment because Marcus understood that some things needed to be done and the doing was more important than the difficulty.

He carried Nate back to camp. Sienna walked beside them, her hand on Nate's arm, maintaining contact. Jim was awake by the fire, feeding it back to life. He said nothing. He put a blanket around Nate's shoulders and guided him onto his sleeping pad and Nate lay down and closed his eyes and Jim sat beside him for the rest of the night, one hand on his shoulder, not praying — or maybe praying, the line between presence and prayer being, as Jim would say, nonexistent.

Nobody discussed it in the morning.

# Chapter 24: What Dale Learned

I came back slowly. Not from a place — from a state. The state was the one where you stop being the person who processes and become the person who is processed. I'd been there for two days and I don't remember much of it except Sienna's hand and Jim's shoulder and Marcus carrying me and Caleb putting the beagle in my lap and the weight of a small carved dog in my hands being the most real thing in the world.

On the morning of Day 41 I woke up and the analytical machinery was back online. Not fully — the crack was still there, and would be, and I could feel it the way you feel a broken bone that's been set but not healed. But the machinery was running. I could think. I could observe. I could plan.

But first there was the morning, and the morning was slow. Ruth made me tea from a packet she'd been hoarding — chamomile, the paper tag still attached, the string hanging over the side of a dented camp cup. She didn't say anything while she made it. She didn't say anything when she handed it to me. She sat on a log across from mine and read her romance novel and the only sound was pages turning and the tea cooling and the specific silence of a person who is keeping you company without requiring you to be anything.

Jim came through with Caleb. Caleb sat beside me and leaned against my arm and showed me a rock he'd found — quartz, milky, with a vein of something glittery running through it. "Marcus says it's worth a million dollars," he said. "He's lying but I'm keeping it." Then he climbed up and went to find more rocks, and the whole interaction lasted forty-five seconds and cost nothing and was worth everything.

What Caleb doesn't know — what I hope he never knows — is that he cries in his sleep. Every night. Small, hitching sounds, the kind a child makes when the crying has gone on so long the body has automated it. He never remembers in the morning. Jim holds him through it, one hand on Caleb's back, not waking him, because waking him would mean explaining and explaining would mean making it real and the mercy, for now, is that Caleb's grief lives only in his sleep where he can't see it. None of us mention it. We lie in our sleeping bags and listen to a seven-year-old cry for parents he hasn't talked about since Week Two and we say nothing because saying something would break the one protection he has left, which is not knowing.

These are the moments that don't make the journal entries. The tea. The rock. The sound of Ruth turning pages. They happened between the crises the way grass grows between stones — quietly, persistently, without anyone deciding they should. I want you to know about them because the version of this story that only contains the fear and the strategy and the running is not the true version. The true version has chamomile tea in it. The true version has a seven-year-old showing you a rock.

Dale was sitting across from me at the fire, carving. The turtle was nearly finished — the hexagonal plates of the shell emerging with clean, precise strokes. His hands were steady. They'd been steady for days now, the withdrawal broken back around Day 8 on the trail, but I was only now seeing it properly because I'd been inside my own weather system and had stopped noticing anything outside it.

He looked up and caught me watching his hands.

"You're back," he said. Not a question.

"I'm back."

He set down the knife. "Good. Because I want to teach you something. All of you. Not HALT — that was the basics. This is the advanced course."

---

He taught us that morning, sitting around the campfire, the November light coming through the canopy in broken columns. Ruth was there, walking stick across her lap. Marcus leaning against a tree, listening with the attention of a man who had spent three weeks self-medicating with bourbon and recognized the vocabulary. Maria beside Dale, her shoulder against his, the point of contact that was their marriage's remaining architecture. Sienna next to me. Jim across the fire. Caleb on the ground with the zoo.

"Radical acceptance," Dale said. "The name is terrible. It sounds like a bumper sticker. But it's the most useful thing I ever learned and it applies to exactly where we are."

He stood up. He paced — three steps forward, three back, the habit of a man who'd spent years in small rooms talking about hard things.

"Here's what it means. The situation is what it is. Your feelings about the situation are not the situation. You can feel terrified and still be safe. You can feel hopeless and still have options. You can feel like the world is ending —" A glance around the group. "— and the world is, in fact, ending, and your feeling about it is accurate, and the feeling is still not the thing itself. The feeling is weather. The situation is geography. You navigate the geography. You endure the weather."

Ruth: "That's remarkably coherent for someone who learned it in a rehabilitation clinic."

"Rehab was the most educational experience of my life. More than high school. More than the army. More than six years of active addiction, which was its own education, but the curriculum was pain and the degree was worthless." He almost smiled. "In rehab I learned that the brain lies. Not maliciously — the brain lies the way a GPS lies when the map is outdated. It gives you directions based on old data. 'Turn left to feel better.' 'Use this substance to stop the pain.' 'Run from the thing that scares you.' The directions were correct in the old world. In this world, the directions will kill you."

He stopped pacing. Faced us.

"Urge surfing. You know this one from HALT, but I want to go deeper. When the urge comes — the craving, the fear, the panic — you don't fight it. You don't suppress it. You ride it. You notice it: 'My heart rate is up. My hands are sweating. My brain is telling me to run.' You notice it the way you'd notice a wave in the ocean. The wave is real. The wave has power. And the wave passes. Every wave passes. You don't have to do anything except not drown, and not drowning is mostly about not panicking."

Marcus, from the back: "That sounds like something I should have heard twenty years ago."

"It sounds like something everyone should hear. The recovery community figured out the mechanics of emotional regulation before the neuroscientists did. We had to — our lives depended on it. And now everyone's life depends on it and the irony is —" He looked at his hands again. Steady. "The irony is that the thing that destroyed me is the thing that trained me. Six years of addiction gave me the problem. Twelve years of recovery gave me the skills. And the skills are the exact skills you need to survive a pathogen that feeds on fear."

He sat down.

"Rock bottom was just training," he said. "And every one of you — every person sitting at this fire who has ever been afraid, or addicted, or depressed, or anxious, or broken in whatever way your particular brain decided to break — has training you don't know you have. Your damage is your skillset. The thing that went wrong is the thing that prepared you. I know that sounds like a motivational poster. I know that. But I'm three weeks past my last dose of Suboxone and my hands are steady and I'm alive and the reason I'm alive is that my brain broke in exactly the right way at exactly the right time and I spent twelve years learning to manage the break."

The camp was quiet. The light came through the canopy and made patches on the ground and Caleb was arranging his animals in a line — beagle, cardinal, fox, turtle — and the line looked like a parade going somewhere hopeful.

Jim, from across the fire: "Dale, that's the best sermon I've ever heard."

"It's not a sermon. Sermons have endings. This is a practice. You do it every day. Every five minutes, if you have to."

"That's also what faith is."

Dale looked at Jim. Two men who had spent their lives in folding chairs — one in church basements, one in meeting rooms — who had arrived at the same discipline from opposite directions. Dale's practice was secular, hard-won, built on failure and pharmacology. Jim's was sacred, equally hard-won, built on belief and the same stubbornness. The practice was the same. The names were different.

"Yeah," Dale said. "I guess it is."

**JOURNAL ENTRY #17:**

*Dale's damage was his skillset. His words, not mine. But I've been sitting with them since the lesson, turning them over the way he turns wood in his hands, and I think the principle extends further than he meant it.*

*My damage is my skillset too. But not the way I've been telling it.*

*I've been telling the story where I'm a fat kid who happened to be good at pattern recognition. In that story, the body is the limitation and the brain is the asset and the gap between them is the joke — the running gag (emphasis on running, which I can't do) that gets me through the day. The joke is: isn't it funny that the least capable body in the group houses the most useful mind. Everybody laughs. Nobody expects me to change.*

*Sienna told me to stop. She said I was building the case for my own powerlessness. She said the old world could afford comfortable lies and passive withdrawal and this world can't. She said that in the best case scenario, everything that goes wrong is my fault, because that means I can fix it.*

*I hated her for saying it. I hate her less now. I hate her less every day, which is a trajectory that points toward something I don't have a word for yet.*

*Here is what I'm trying to learn: the body is not a verdict. The body is a starting point. I weigh less than I did on Day One — not much, but some, because five weeks of rationing and walking will do that. I carried twenty-five pounds up a mountain. I walked through a septic tank. I will walk through whatever comes next, not because I'm the kind of person who walks through things but because I'm choosing to be that person, today, and tomorrow I'll choose again. Strategy requires responsibility and action and change. Learning from mistakes and doing better. The notebook is not a substitute for the walk. The walk is the thing.*

*I'm not going to stop being funny about it. The humor is mine and I'm keeping it. But I'm going to stop using the humor as a door I hide behind. The door is open now. Sienna opened it. I'm walking through.*

---

We broke camp after the lesson and continued south on the highway. The terrain was opening — the mountains behind us now, the road descending through the last of the switchbacks toward the broad plateau where Fayetteville sat. Dale walked near the front, pushing one of the shopping carts. His pace was steady — the walk of a man who had come through the worst of it and was standing on the other side. Maria walked behind him, and I noticed — the way I notice things, the way I can't not notice things — that she wasn't walking behind him to support him. She was walking behind him because he was setting the pace and she was following it, and the dynamic between them had shifted from "managing the addict" to "walking with the man," and the shift was small and enormous and neither of them acknowledged it.

Marcus, walking beside me, said quietly: "He's tougher than he looks."

"He's tougher than anyone."

"Don't tell him that. He'll start thinking he's important and then he'll get lazy." A pause. "That's a joke. Truckers make those. They're bad."

"You've been making better ones."

"Don't tell me that either. I have a reputation."

We walked. The highway curved through the last of the hills. Through the trees I could see the terrain flattening ahead — the outskirts of something, the edge of a city, buildings and fields and the built-up sprawl of a college town.

"Fayetteville," Marcus said, reading a road sign. "Ten miles."

I nodded. Ten miles. The last stretch. But between us and the university — whatever was gathered on the outskirts of a city that had once held eighty thousand people. The Turned would be concentrated there. Drawn to the population center, the infrastructure, the gravitational pull of human settlement.

"Then we'll need everything Dale just taught us."

Marcus nodded. We walked on. The highway dropped toward the city and the sky widened above us and somewhere ahead, past whatever waited on the outskirts of Fayetteville, was the university and Dr. Moss and the sound of a frequency that kept the Turned at bay.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #18:**

*Dale is through the withdrawal. Steady hands. Steady voice. Four weeks past his last Suboxone and he's alive and functioning and the reason he's alive is twelve years of sitting in folding chairs and not doing the thing his brain told him to do.*

*He taught us radical acceptance. The situation is what it is. Your feelings about the situation are not the situation. This is the most useful sentence I've learned since "the mechanism is adrenaline," and it's more important because it applies to everything — not just the Turned, not just survival, but the grief and the fear and the fact that my mother is standing in a parking lot in Clarksville and I can't save her and the feeling of that is not the thing itself.*

*Fayetteville. Ten miles. Whatever's gathered on the outskirts of a city that held eighty thousand people.*

*I'm scared. My resting heart rate is 72. The gap is smaller than it used to be. I'm using Dale's techniques — noticing the fear, not fighting it, not riding it, just noticing. The fear is weather. The city is geography. I navigate the geography.*

*I navigate the geography.*
