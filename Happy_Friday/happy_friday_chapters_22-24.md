# Chapter 22: Mom

Day 35. The trail descended from a ridgeline to cross a county road on the outskirts of a town I recognized.

I recognized it because the sign was still standing: REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER — 2 MILES, with an arrow pointing east. The hospital where my mother worked. The hospital where she'd gone on Friday night for a twelve-hour shift and never come back.

I'd known since Day 1. The math was clear — night shift, first night, a hospital filling with panicking patients and panicking staff. The cascade of fear would have been overwhelming. She never had a chance.

I'd carried this in the analytical part of my brain, the part that processed data without feeling it. I'd carried it the way you carry a sealed envelope — knowing what's inside, not opening it, because the contents are real whether you read them or not and at least the envelope is containable.

We crossed the county road. The hospital was visible to the east. Parking lot. Ambulance bay with its doors open.

A cluster of Turned stood in the lot. Maybe twenty, milling in the standard pattern — a former hospital staff, still gravitating to the place where they'd worked. Among them, in blue scrubs, was a woman with my mother's build. My mother's hair — dark, pulled back, the ponytail she wore for night shifts. My mother's hands, hanging at her sides. My mother's face, smooth and blank and tilted toward the morning sun.

I stopped walking.

The group moved on for a few steps. Sienna noticed first — she always noticed first. She stopped. Turned back.

I was standing in the road looking at my mother across two hundred yards of parking lot and I was not moving and I was not breathing because the envelope was open and the contents were not data. The contents were a woman in blue scrubs who had said "Happy Friday, bud" three hundred times and who brought home Whataburger after every shift and who kept two nursing textbooks on a shelf like trophies and who had taught me by accident everything I needed to survive and who was standing in a parking lot with bare feet and nothing behind her eyes.

"Nate," Sienna said.

I breathed. The breath was the hardest thing I've ever done. Harder than the crossing. Harder than the septic tank. Harder than the overpass. Breathing meant continuing to be alive in a world where my mother was not my mother and would never be my mother again and breathing meant accepting this and the acceptance was not peace. The acceptance was a wound held open by the conscious act of not looking away.

Sienna took my hand.

She had never done this before. In six weeks of proximity and argument and the slow accumulation of whatever we were becoming, she had touched my elbow twice and my arm once, each time brief and functional. This was different. Her fingers between my fingers. Her grip firm and warm. She was not letting go and she was not saying anything and she was holding me in the world by the specific physical fact of her hand.

We stood there. Five minutes or five hours.

Then we walked on.

---

I didn't write in the journal that night. I sat by the fire and said nothing and ate nothing and everyone left me alone because they understood. Caleb brought me the wooden beagle and put it in my lap without a word and went back to Marcus's side.

Two days later I opened the notebook.

# Chapter 23: Nate Walks

*Third-person interstitial.*

---

Sienna woke at 3 AM and Nate's sleeping bag was empty.

They were camped in a small church — not theirs, a white clapboard one-room chapel on a forest service road, its door unlocked, its pews dusty, its hymnals scattered on the floor. The group was inside, sleeping in the pews and on the floor, wrapped in sleeping bags and church donation blankets. The fire in the woodstove had burned down to coals. The room smelled like ash and old wood and the particular staleness of a building no one had opened in weeks.

Nate's sleeping bag was flat. His backpack was where he'd left it. His binoculars were gone.

Sienna didn't wake anyone. She pulled on her shoes, took the blood pressure cuff — habit, the cuff went everywhere now, pink and absurd and essential — and went out the side door.

The night was cold. November in the Boston Mountains, the air sharp enough to taste, the stars dense above the canopy gap. She listened. Crickets. Wind. The small sounds of a forest at night that she was learning to distinguish from the other sounds — the ones that meant something was wrong.

She heard footsteps. East. On the road.

She found him a quarter mile from the chapel, walking. Not the careful, measured walk he'd taught them — the breathing, the slow pace, the conscious suppression of the body's emergency signals. He was just walking. In the dark, without a flashlight, without a plan, on a road that led back the way they'd come. Toward the hospital.

She caught up to him. His face was blank in the starlight — not the analytical blankness he wore like armor, the one that said *I am processing data and not feeling.* This was different. This was empty. The face of a person who had run out of the thing that held them together and was operating on the last fumes of muscle memory.

"Nate," she said.

He didn't stop. Didn't acknowledge her. Kept walking.

She walked alongside him. She didn't touch him, didn't talk, didn't try to block his path. She matched his pace and stayed a foot to his left and let the silence be the thing between them. She'd learned this from watching him — the patient observation, the refusal to intervene until you understood what you were intervening in. He'd taught her more about stillness than he'd ever know.

They walked for five minutes. The road was dark. The trees were dark. Somewhere to the east, maybe ten miles now, was the hospital parking lot and the cluster of Turned and the woman in blue scrubs.

"Nate, she's not there."

He kept walking. Then he said: "I know."

His voice was flat. Two words, no inflection. The voice of a person who understood with absolute clarity that the thing they were walking toward was not the thing they needed and who could not stop walking toward it because the need was deeper than understanding, deeper than the analytical machinery that had kept him alive for five weeks, deeper than the rules he'd written in his notebook and the lessons he'd learned from failures and the carefully constructed framework of data-driven survival that was his version of a personality. The need was the animal at the bottom — the child who wanted his mother — and the child did not care about epinephrine thresholds or density calculations or the optimal strategy for surviving a world that punished love.

Sienna had watched Nate hold his composure through everything. The knock on the door. The septic tank. The overpass. The Lyles burning. She had watched him absorb horror after horror and convert each one into data, each trauma into a journal entry, each loss into a lesson. She had admired it and been frightened by it in equal measure — the capacity to feel everything and process it into something useful, the cold engine running behind the eyes of a fifteen-year-old who should have been doing homework.

She understood now that the engine had limits. That the processing was not the same as the feeling, and the feelings he hadn't felt were still in there, accumulating, pressing against the walls of the container he'd built for them, and the container had cracked open on a road in the dark because he'd seen his mother's face on a stranger's body and the crack was beyond repair.

She started talking. Not to convince him — to be present. To fill the dark with something that wasn't silence and wasn't analysis.

"My parents left on Friday night," she said. "Around eight. They were going to get Jaylen from my grandmother's in Oklahoma City. My dad said they'd be back by midnight. My mom kissed me on the forehead and said 'Lock the door.'" She paused. "I locked the door. That's the last thing I did for them. I locked the door."

Nate's pace slowed. Not much. A fraction.

"I decided three weeks ago that they're alive. Not because I have evidence. Not because the math supports it. Because the alternative is a thought I can't afford to have. If I let myself think they're dead — or turned — or standing in a parking lot somewhere in Oklahoma with blank faces and bare feet — then I can't function. I can't run. I can't carry Caleb. I can't be the person this group needs me to be. So I decided they're alive and I carry that decision like a lie I tell myself every morning and I know it's probably a lie and I carry it anyway because the lie is lighter than the truth and I need my arms free."

Nate stopped walking.

Not because she convinced him. Because his legs gave out. He sat down on the road — just folded, the way a structure folds when the load-bearing element fails — and he was on the asphalt in the dark and his hands were over his face and he was crying.

Not the controlled, silent crying from the night of the knock. This was ugly and loud and completely uncontrolled — the sound of a fifteen-year-old boy who had held everything together for five weeks through intelligence and discipline and the ruthless conversion of grief into strategy, and who had run out of conversion capacity, and who was now producing the raw sound of loss in the middle of a road in the dark in a world where raw sound was the thing that killed you.

Sienna dropped to her knees beside him. She put her hand over his mouth. Not gently — this wasn't tender, this was survival, this was the same instinct that had made Nate bite his own hand on the night of the knock.

"Quiet," she said. "Quiet. I know. But quiet."

He couldn't stop. The sound came through her fingers — muffled, broken, the sound of something that had been sealed too long and was venting. She pressed harder. She put her other arm around him — the first time she'd held him, the first full-body contact between them, and it was not romantic and it was not comforting and it was the most intimate thing either of them had experienced because intimacy, in this world, was the act of keeping someone alive when they wanted to die.

"I know," she whispered. "I know. But quiet. Please. Quiet."

The crying subsided. Not because he was finished — because the body runs out before the grief does, and at some point the physical machinery of crying depletes its resources and the sound stops even though the cause doesn't. He sat on the road with Sienna's hand over his mouth and Sienna's arm around him and he shook and didn't make a sound and the stars were cold above them and the road was dark in both directions.

Marcus found them twenty minutes later. He'd woken, noticed the empty sleeping bags, followed the road. He stood over them for a moment — two kids on the asphalt, one holding the other — and he didn't ask what happened.

He picked Nate up. This was not easy — Nate was not small, and Marcus was tired, and the act of lifting a hundred and eighty pounds off the ground required a physical effort that Marcus performed without comment because Marcus understood that some things needed to be done and the doing was more important than the difficulty.

He carried Nate back to the chapel. Sienna walked beside them, her hand on Nate's arm, maintaining contact. Jim was waiting at the door. He said nothing. He put a blanket around Nate's shoulders and led him to a pew and Nate lay down and closed his eyes and Jim sat in the pew behind him for the rest of the night, one hand on his shoulder, not praying — or maybe praying, the line between presence and prayer being, as Jim would say, nonexistent.

Nobody discussed it in the morning.

# Chapter 24: What Dale Learned

I came back slowly. Not from a place — from a state. The state was the one where you stop being the person who processes and become the person who is processed. I'd been there for two days and I don't remember much of it except Sienna's hand and Jim's shoulder and Marcus carrying me and Caleb putting the beagle in my lap and the weight of a small carved dog in my hands being the most real thing in the world.

On the morning of Day 38 I woke up and the analytical machinery was back online. Not fully — the crack was still there, and would be, and I could feel it the way you feel a broken bone that's been set but not healed. But the machinery was running. I could think. I could observe. I could plan.

But first there was the morning, and the morning was slow. Ruth made me tea from a packet she'd been hoarding — chamomile, the paper tag still attached, the string hanging over the side of a chipped mug someone had left in the chapel's tiny kitchen. She didn't say anything while she made it. She didn't say anything when she handed it to me. She sat in the pew across from mine and read her romance novel and the only sound was pages turning and the tea cooling and the specific silence of a person who is keeping you company without requiring you to be anything.

Jim came through with Caleb. Caleb climbed onto my pew and leaned against me and showed me a rock he'd found — quartz, milky, with a vein of something glittery running through it. "Marcus says it's worth a million dollars," he said. "He's lying but I'm keeping it." Then he climbed down and went outside to find more rocks, and the whole interaction lasted forty-five seconds and cost nothing and was worth everything.

These are the moments that don't make the journal entries. The tea. The rock. The sound of Ruth turning pages. They happened between the crises the way grass grows between stones — quietly, persistently, without anyone deciding they should. I want you to know about them because the version of this story that only contains the fear and the strategy and the running is not the true version. The true version has chamomile tea in it. The true version has a seven-year-old showing you a rock.

Dale was sitting across from me in the chapel, carving. The fox was finished. He was working on something new — a turtle, the shell emerging from the wood in careful hexagonal plates. His hands were steady.

His hands were steady.

I stared at his hands for a long moment before I understood what I was seeing. Two weeks ago, those hands had shaken so badly that his carvings were rough and angry. The Suboxone withdrawal — the sweating, the cramping, the anxiety spike that could have killed him — had been a presence in the group like a weather system, something we all tracked and worried about and planned around. And now his hands were steady and I hadn't noticed when they'd stopped shaking because I'd been inside my own weather system and had stopped noticing anything.

"How long?" I asked. Meaning: how long have your hands been still.

Dale looked at his hands. Turned them over. Studied them the way you'd study a landscape you'd been traveling through and only now recognized.

"Three days," he said. "Maybe four. The worst was Day 30 to 33. Cramps, sweating, the full thing. Your propranolol helped — kept the heart rate under 100 when it wanted to be at 130. The clonazepam helped at night. But mostly it was —" He paused. Held up the knife. "This. Keeping the hands moving. Keeping the brain focused on a single small task. It's the same thing my counselor taught me in year one: don't think about the craving. Think about the next five minutes. Do something with your hands. The craving passes. The five minutes become ten. The ten become an hour. The hour becomes a day you didn't use."

He looked at the turtle.

"Twelve years of that. Twelve years of five-minute increments, of sitting in folding chairs in basements telling myself the feeling would pass. And you know what? The feeling passes in withdrawal the same way it passes in a craving the same way it passes when a Turned is standing in front of you and your body is screaming *run.* The mechanism is the same. The brain sends a signal. The signal says *do the thing.* And you don't do the thing. You sit with the signal. You let it be loud. You let it be unbearable. And you don't do the thing. And it passes."

He set down the knife.

"I want to teach you something. All of you. Not HALT — that was the basics. This is the advanced course."

---

He taught us that morning, sitting in the chapel pews, the November light coming through windows that still had crosses in them. Ruth was there, walking stick across her lap. Marcus in the back, listening with the attention of a man who had spent three weeks self-medicating with bourbon and recognized the vocabulary. Maria beside Dale, her shoulder against his, the point of contact that was their marriage's remaining architecture. Sienna next to me. Jim in the front pew. Caleb on the floor with the zoo.

"Radical acceptance," Dale said. "The name is terrible. It sounds like a bumper sticker. But it's the most useful thing I ever learned and it applies to exactly where we are."

He stood up. He paced — three steps forward, three back, the habit of a man who'd spent years in small rooms talking about hard things.

"Here's what it means. The situation is what it is. Your feelings about the situation are not the situation. You can feel terrified and still be safe. You can feel hopeless and still have options. You can feel like the world is ending —" A glance around the room. "— and the world is, in fact, ending, and your feeling about it is accurate, and the feeling is still not the thing itself. The feeling is weather. The situation is geography. You navigate the geography. You endure the weather."

Ruth: "That's remarkably coherent for someone who learned it in a rehabilitation clinic."

"Rehab was the most educational experience of my life. More than high school. More than the army. More than six years of active addiction, which was its own education, but the curriculum was pain and the degree was worthless." He almost smiled. "In rehab I learned that the brain lies. Not maliciously — the brain lies the way a GPS lies when the map is outdated. It gives you directions based on old data. 'Turn left to feel better.' 'Use this substance to stop the pain.' 'Run from the thing that scares you.' The directions were correct in the old world. In this world, the directions will kill you."

He stopped pacing. Faced us.

"Urge surfing. You know this one from HALT, but I want to go deeper. When the urge comes — the craving, the fear, the panic — you don't fight it. You don't suppress it. You ride it. You notice it: 'My heart rate is up. My hands are sweating. My brain is telling me to run.' You notice it the way you'd notice a wave in the ocean. The wave is real. The wave has power. And the wave passes. Every wave passes. You don't have to do anything except not drown, and not drowning is mostly about not panicking."

Marcus, from the back: "That sounds like something I should have heard twenty years ago."

"It sounds like something everyone should hear. The recovery community figured out the mechanics of emotional regulation before the neuroscientists did. We had to — our lives depended on it. And now everyone's life depends on it and the irony is —" He looked at his hands again. Steady. "The irony is that the thing that destroyed me is the thing that trained me. Six years of addiction gave me the problem. Twelve years of recovery gave me the skills. And the skills are the exact skills you need to survive a pathogen that feeds on fear."

He sat down.

"Rock bottom was just training," he said. "And every one of you — every person in this room who has ever been afraid, or addicted, or depressed, or anxious, or broken in whatever way your particular brain decided to break — has training you don't know you have. Your damage is your skillset. The thing that went wrong is the thing that prepared you. I know that sounds like a motivational poster. I know that. But I'm twenty days past my last dose of Suboxone and my hands are steady and I'm alive and the reason I'm alive is that my brain broke in exactly the right way at exactly the right time and I spent twelve years learning to manage the break."

The chapel was quiet. The light came through the windows and made crosses on the floor and Caleb was arranging his animals in a line — beagle, cardinal, fox, turtle — and the line looked like a parade going somewhere hopeful.

Jim, from his pew: "Dale, that's the best sermon I've ever heard."

"It's not a sermon. Sermons have endings. This is a practice. You do it every day. Every five minutes, if you have to."

"That's also what faith is."

Dale looked at Jim. Two men in folding chairs — one in a pew, one standing — who had arrived at the same discipline from opposite directions. Dale's practice was secular, hard-won, built on failure and pharmacology. Jim's was sacred, equally hard-won, built on belief and the same pharmacology. The practice was the same. The names were different.

"Yeah," Dale said. "I guess it is."

---

We broke camp after the lesson and climbed back onto the ridgeline. The trail wound northwest through the last of the Boston Mountains — gentler now, the ridges lower, the valleys between them wider. We were descending toward the Arkansas River valley on the far side, where Fayetteville sat on the plateau beyond.

Dale walked near the front now. His pace was steady — not the shuffling, shaking walk of the withdrawal weeks but something approaching his natural gait, the walk of a man who had come through the worst of it and was standing on the other side. Maria walked behind him, and I noticed — the way I notice things, the way I can't not notice things — that she wasn't walking behind him to support him. She was walking behind him because he was setting the pace and she was following it, and the dynamic between them had shifted from "managing the addict" to "walking with the man," and the shift was small and enormous and neither of them acknowledged it.

Marcus, walking beside me, said quietly: "He's tougher than he looks."

"He's tougher than anyone."

"Don't tell him that. He'll start thinking he's important and then he'll get lazy." A pause. "That's a joke. Truckers make those. They're bad."

"You've been making better ones."

"Don't tell me that either. I have a reputation."

We walked. The trail descended. Ahead, through a gap in the canopy, I could see the valley beyond the mountains — a broad river bottom, flat and grey in the distance, the terrain changing from ridgeline to lowland. Marcus saw it too. His face changed.

"Valley crossing," he said. "Tomorrow."

I nodded. I'd been studying the map. The trail dropped a thousand feet into the Mulberry River valley, crossed the water, and climbed back up the other side. It was the last major crossing before the final push to Fayetteville. Marcus had warned us about valleys and water. The flat terrain. The open sightlines. The way water drew the Turned the same way it drew everything alive.

"We'll glass it from the bluff first," I said. "Standard protocol. If it's clear, we cross. If it's not —"

"If it's not, we figure it out." Marcus looked at the valley. "I've driven the roads above that river. Big bottomland. Open. If there's a herd down there, it'll be the biggest thing we've seen."

"Then we'll need everything Dale just taught us."

Marcus nodded. We walked on. The trail dropped toward the valley and the sky widened above us and somewhere ahead, past one more crossing, past one more test, was the university and Dr. Moss and the sound of a frequency that kept the Turned at bay.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #17:**

*Dale is through the withdrawal. Steady hands. Steady voice. Twenty days past his last Suboxone and he's alive and functioning and the reason he's alive is twelve years of sitting in folding chairs and not doing the thing his brain told him to do.*

*He taught us radical acceptance. The situation is what it is. Your feelings about the situation are not the situation. This is the most useful sentence I've learned since "the mechanism is adrenaline," and it's more important because it applies to everything — not just the Turned, not just survival, but the grief and the fear and the fact that my mother is standing in a parking lot and I can't save her and the feeling of that is not the thing itself.*

*Valley crossing tomorrow. Last major obstacle. Marcus says the bottomland is big and open. If there's a herd, it'll be the biggest we've seen.*

*I'm scared. My resting heart rate is 72. The gap is smaller than it used to be. I'm using Dale's techniques — noticing the fear, not fighting it, not riding it, just noticing. The fear is weather. The valley is geography. I navigate the geography.*

*I navigate the geography.*
