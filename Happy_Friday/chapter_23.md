# Chapter 23: Sienna Stops

*Third-person interstitial.*

---

Nate woke because the silence changed.

Not the ambient silence — the highway silence, the wind-through-dead-cars silence that had become the sound of sleep. This was a subtraction. Something that had been there was gone. He lay still for three seconds, cataloguing: fire (coals, low), wind (north, steady), breathing (six sources, not seven).

Sienna's sleeping bag was empty.

He sat up. Marcus was on watch — seated on the retaining wall, crossbow across his knees, scanning the dark. He saw Nate and tilted his head south. The direction Sienna had gone.

"Ten minutes," Marcus said. Quiet. "She's walking the shoulder. Didn't take anything."

Nate pulled on his shoes. He didn't take the binoculars or the hatchet or the notebook. He took nothing because what Sienna needed was not a tool.

He found her a quarter mile south, sitting on the guardrail above the drainage ditch. Not walking — sitting. Her knees were pulled up and her arms were wrapped around them and she was staring south down the highway toward nothing, toward Oklahoma, toward the place her parents had been driving when the world changed.

She heard him coming. She didn't turn.

He sat on the guardrail beside her. Not close enough to crowd. Close enough to matter. He'd learned this from her — from the hours in the woods after the roadblock, from every time she'd walked near him on the trail without speaking, from the way she'd put her hand over his mouth on the highway and held him and said *quiet, quiet, I know.* She had taught him what presence looked like. He was returning the lesson.

They sat. The highway stretched south in the starlight — a gray ribbon between dark mountains, the abandoned cars like sleeping animals, the guardrail cold under their hands. Somewhere far to the south and then west, across mountains and rivers and the ruined infrastructure of a civilization that had stopped functioning six weeks ago, was Oklahoma City. Was a grandmother's house. Were two parents who had kissed their daughter on the forehead and said *lock the door* and driven into a night that never ended.

"I can't do it anymore," Sienna said. Her voice was flat. Not angry, not tearful — flat. The voice of a runner who has hit the wall and knows it.

Nate waited.

"The lie. The one I told you about — that they're alive. That my parents are alive in Oklahoma and everything is fine and I just have to get to Fayetteville and then somehow get to them." She stared south. "I've been telling myself that every morning for six weeks. Every morning I wake up and I rebuild it and I carry it all day and at night I put it down and in the morning I pick it back up and it's heavier every time. And today —"

She stopped. Her jaw was tight. She was holding something back with the same discipline she'd used to sprint through Turned to reach Caleb, the same controlled power that made her fast and sure and the person the group trusted to close the distance when the distance mattered.

"Today I saw those hands on the wire," she said. "And I thought: those are someone's parents too. Every single one of them. Someone's mother, someone's father, someone who kissed their kid on the forehead and said *lock the door.* Three hundred of them. And I looked at the wire and I thought — what if they're in wire somewhere? What if the thing I've been telling myself is a lie and the truth is that my parents are in a ditch in Oklahoma or tangled in something or standing in a parking lot with bare feet and smiles that aren't theirs and I'm up here on a hillside watching a fifteen-year-old play Taylor Swift for a massacre?"

Her voice cracked on the last word. Not loudly — Sienna didn't do loudly. The crack was small and controlled and devastating, the sound of a bridge cable snapping under load while the rest of the bridge held.

Nate said: "The lie is heavier when you carry it alone."

She looked at him. First time. Her eyes were wet and furious — furious at herself for cracking, furious at the world for being a place where seventeen-year-olds sat on guardrails in the dark wondering if their parents were dead.

"I've been carrying mine for five weeks," he said. "My mother. The parking lot. The anger." He paused. "I put it down yesterday. Not the grief — the grief stays. You don't put down grief. But the lie I was telling myself — that the anger was useful, that it was fuel, that I could run on rage and never pay for it — that lie almost killed me. It killed three hundred people on a highway."

Sienna wiped her face. Quick, angry, the same gesture she'd made on the hillside.

"You don't have to decide tonight," Nate said. "Whether they're alive or dead. You don't have to decide at all. You can carry the not-knowing without turning it into a story. The story is what's heavy — the lie or the truth, either one. The not-knowing is lighter because it's honest."

"Since when are you a therapist?"

"Since Dale taught me HALT and Jim taught me patience and you taught me that sitting next to someone in the dark is more useful than solving the problem."

She almost smiled. But instead turned away.

They sat on the guardrail for a long time. The stars moved. The wind came through the cut in the mountains and carried the smell of cold rock and dead leaves and the faint, distant smell of the roadblock they'd left behind, the smell that would take weeks of rain to wash from the asphalt.

"My mom's name is Denise," Sienna said. Quiet. "My dad's name is Michael. Jaylen is nine. He's afraid of dogs and he can do a backflip on the trampoline and he told me once that I was the fastest person in the world and I didn't correct him."

"I think I need to let them go," Sienna said. "The way you let your mom go. I think I need to just — accept it. Stop carrying the maybe. Stop waking up every morning and rebuilding the story where they're fine and Jaylen is doing backflips in grandma's backyard and my dad is grilling and my mom is telling him the charcoal's too hot." She wiped her face again. "I think I need to just say they're gone and stop pretending."

"No," Nate said. The word came out harder than he intended. She looked at him.

"Don't do that," he said. "What I put down was the rage — the lie that being angry was the same as being strong. That's not the same as giving up on them. We can't walk to Oklahoma. Not now, not from here. But we're not the only survivors. There are people in that gas station behind us. There are people in Fayetteville. There are people in basements and churches and fire stations all over the country doing what we're doing — organizing, planning, figuring it out. Sooner or later those groups connect. They have to. Because that's the one thing we have that the organism doesn't." He paused. "It doesn't think. It spreads, but it doesn't strategize. It doesn't send scouts or draw maps or write things in notebooks. People do. That's our advantage — the only one that matters. And people will use it. We'll find out what's left. We'll find out who's still out there. Including Oklahoma."

She was quiet for a long time. Then: "You sound like Jim."

"Worse things to sound like."

She leaned into him. Shoulder against shoulder, the guardrail cold beneath them, the stars turning overhead. Not a collapse — a leaning. The deliberate transfer of weight from one person to another, temporary and specific, the way you lean on a wall while you catch your breath before running again.

He let her lean. He held still the way she'd held still in the woods after the roadblock — present, patient, refusing to fix what couldn't be fixed. Being there. That was all. Being there was the whole thing.

Marcus found them an hour later. He stood over them — two kids on a guardrail, one leaning on the other — and his face did something that Marcus's face almost never did. It softened.

"Time to come back?" he asked. Not an order. An invitation.

They walked back together. Nate's hand on Sienna's elbow once, briefly, guiding her around a pothole in the dark. She didn't flinch. She didn't pull away. She only walked beside him.

Nobody discussed it in the morning. But something had shifted — the way the group moved around the two of them, the specific quality of the silence that surrounded them. Ruth watched them with the expression of a woman who had been married for fifty years and recognized the geometry. Jim put his hand on Sienna's shoulder at breakfast and she let him.

Nate wrote nothing in the journal about that night. Some things belonged to the dark and the guardrail and the stars and the girl who had taught him what carrying looked like.
