# Chapter 23: Nate Walks

*Third-person interstitial.*

Marcus woke her at 3 AM.

He was crouched beside her sleeping bag, one hand on her shoulder, the other holding the crossbow loosely at his side. His face was the one he wore when he was worried and didn't want anyone to know — jaw set, eyes careful.

"Nate's walking," he said. Quiet. Resigned.

Sienna sat up. "Walking where?"

"North. Back up the highway. I watched him go twenty minutes ago." Marcus had been on watch — seated on the retaining wall at the edge of the pulloff, crossbow across his knees, scanning the dark highway in both directions the way he'd done every night since Clarksville. He'd seen Nate rise from the sleeping bag, take the binoculars, and walk past the fire without looking back. "I let him go. He needed — I don't know what he needed. But he's been gone too long and he's heading the wrong direction."

They were camped in a highway pulloff — a wide gravel shoulder where truckers used to park, the shopping carts pulled to the side, sleeping bags laid out on pads in the shelter of a concrete retaining wall. The fire had burned down to coals that pulsed orange when the wind moved through. The group was scattered along the pulloff, the shapes of sleeping bodies barely visible in the dark. The air smelled like asphalt and woodsmoke and the particular cold of a November night on exposed highway.

Sienna pulled on her shoes, took the blood pressure cuff — habit, the cuff went everywhere now, pink and absurd and essential — and moved past the fire. Marcus stayed on watch. That was the arrangement they didn't need to discuss: someone goes after Nate, someone stays with the group. Marcus was the guard. Sienna was the one Nate might actually stop for.

The night was cold. November on Highway 71, the air sharp enough to taste, the stars dense above the open road. She listened. Wind. The distant sound of something — an animal, or not — moving in the scrub beyond the shoulder. The sounds of an empty highway that she was learning to distinguish from the other sounds — the ones that meant something was wrong.

She heard footsteps. North. On the highway.

She found him a quarter mile from camp. He was just walking. In the dark, without a flashlight, without a plan, back up the highway the way they'd come. Back toward Clarksville. Back toward the hospital parking lot where he'd seen her from the truck, the woman in blue scrubs, the day Marcus kept driving.

She caught up to him. His face was blank in the starlight — not the analytical blankness he wore like armor. This was empty. The face of a person who had run out of the thing that held them together.

"Nate," she said.

He didn't stop. Didn't acknowledge her. Kept walking.

She walked alongside him. She didn't touch him, didn't talk, didn't try to block his path. She matched his pace and stayed a foot to his left and let the silence be the thing between them. She'd learned this from watching him — the patient observation, the refusal to intervene until you understood what you were intervening in. He'd taught her more about stillness than he'd ever know.

They walked for five minutes. The highway was dark. The mountains on either side were dark. Somewhere to the north, thirty miles of highway and sixty miles of trail and twenty miles of road away, was the hospital parking lot and the woman in blue scrubs.

"Nate, she's not there."

He kept walking. Then he said: "I know."

His voice was flat. Two words, no inflection. He understood with absolute clarity that the thing he was walking toward was not the thing he needed and he could not stop walking toward it because the need was deeper than understanding, deeper than the machinery that had kept him alive for five weeks, deeper than the notebook and the lessons and the framework. The need was the child who wanted his mother, and the child did not care about epinephrine thresholds or density calculations.

Sienna had watched Nate hold his composure through everything. The knock on the door. The septic tank. The Lyles burning. She had watched him see his mother's face in a parking lot and keep walking. She had watched him absorb horror after horror and convert each one into data, each trauma into a journal entry, each loss into a lesson. She had admired it and been frightened by it — the cold engine running behind the eyes of a fifteen-year-old who should have been doing homework.

She understood now that the engine had limits. The processing was not the same as the feeling, and the feelings he hadn't felt were still in there, pressing against the walls of the container he'd built, and the container had cracked — from the slow grinding of weeks, the hunger and the blisters and three hundred dead people in razor wire and everything the notebook couldn't carry — and the crack was beyond repair.

She started talking. To be present. To fill the dark with something that wasn't silence.

"My parents left on Friday night," she said. "Around eight. They were going to get Jaylen from my grandmother's in Oklahoma City. My dad said they'd be back by midnight. My mom kissed me on the forehead and said 'Lock the door.'" She paused. "I locked the door. That's the last thing I did for them. I locked the door."

Nate's pace slowed. Not much. A fraction.

"I decided three weeks ago that they're alive. I have no evidence. The math doesn't support it. But the alternative is a thought I can't afford to have. If I let myself think they're dead — or turned — or standing in a parking lot somewhere in Oklahoma with blank faces and bare feet — then I can't function. I can't run. I can't carry Caleb. I can't be the person this group needs me to be. So I decided they're alive and I carry that decision like a lie I tell myself every morning and I know it's probably a lie and I carry it anyway because the lie is lighter than the truth and I need my arms free."

Nate stopped walking.

His legs gave out. He sat down on the highway — just folded, the way a structure folds when the load-bearing element fails — and he was on the dirt in the dark and his hands were over his face and he was crying.

Ugly and loud and completely uncontrolled — the sound of a fifteen-year-old boy who had held everything together for five weeks through intelligence and discipline and the ruthless conversion of grief into strategy, and who had run out. The raw sound of loss on an empty highway in the dark, in a world where raw sound was the thing that killed you.

Sienna dropped to her knees beside him. She put her hand over his mouth. Hard — this was survival, the same instinct that had made Nate bite his own hand on the night of the knock.

"Quiet," she said. "Quiet. I know. But quiet."

He couldn't stop. The sound came through her fingers — muffled, broken, the sound of something that had been sealed too long and was venting. She pressed harder. She put her other arm around him — the first time she'd held him, the first full-body contact between them, and it was the most intimate thing either of them had experienced because intimacy, in this world, was keeping someone alive when they wanted to die.

"I know," she whispered. "I know. But quiet. Please. Quiet."

The crying subsided. The body runs out before the grief does. He sat on the asphalt with Sienna's hand over his mouth and Sienna's arm around him and he shook and didn't make a sound and the stars were cold above them and the highway was dark in both directions.

Marcus found them twenty minutes later. He'd woken, noticed the empty sleeping bags, followed the highway. He stood over them for a moment — two kids on the asphalt, one holding the other — and he didn't ask what happened.

He picked Nate up. Nate was not small, and Marcus was tired. He performed the effort without comment because Marcus understood that some things needed to be done.

He carried Nate back to camp. Sienna walked beside them, her hand on Nate's arm, maintaining contact. Jim was awake by the fire, feeding it back to life. He said nothing. He put a blanket around Nate's shoulders and guided him onto his sleeping pad and Nate lay down and closed his eyes and Jim sat beside him for the rest of the night, one hand on his shoulder, not praying — or maybe praying, the line between presence and prayer being, as Jim would say, nonexistent.

Nobody discussed it in the morning.
