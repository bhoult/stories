# Chapter 9: The Asset

On the eighth day, a man walked into the church carrying a CB radio, a case of truck-stop beef jerky, and a flask of bourbon. His name was Marcus Webb. He was forty-two. He was a long-haul driver out of Tulsa who'd been hauling industrial shelving on I-40 when the highways turned into what he described as "a parking lot made of fire."

Jim made coffee. I watched him do it — the same ritual, the same unhurried motions, the same thirty minutes of conversation while Marcus held the mug in both hands and Jim watched the way the hands adjusted to the heat. The same diagnostic. When Marcus set the mug down and picked it back up with a slightly different grip — the unconscious micro-correction that living hands make without thinking — Jim's shoulders relaxed by a fraction that only I noticed because I'd been watching for it. Marcus was human. The coffee had confirmed it.

He sat in the basement on a folding chair too small for him and told us about three days in a truck cab. He said it flatly, without drama — reporting, not feeling.

"I pulled onto a service road. Parked. Sat." He shrugged. "I've done five-day runs to Tacoma. I know how to sit."

"Three days," Jim said. "Alone."

"I was drinking." He held up the flask — stainless steel, dented. "Bourbon. It's not a solution. But it kept the —" He made a vague gesture at his chest. "It kept things level. For a while."

"How did you find us?" I asked.

"Walked. The bourbon ran out on Day 5 and the truck was getting cold and I figured sitting still was just dying slow. So I walked. Back roads, then the highway shoulder. The Turned were everywhere but they didn't bother me." He paused, as if the next part confused him. "They'd look. Tilt their heads. Then go back to whatever they were doing. I don't know why. I wasn't calm — I was just... empty. Too tired to be scared. I figured I was already dead and dead men don't have much to be afraid of."

He'd walked right through them. Not because he understood the mechanism — he didn't, not yet — but because his depression and his grief and his three days of bourbon had left him with nothing the organism could use. His catecholamines were flatlined. He was below threshold by accident, the same way Jim was below threshold by metoprolol and faith. Different roads to the same quiet place.

"Saw the church sign from the highway. The one in the window. Figured if somebody was still putting up signs, somebody was still alive."

Maria, from the pantry closet, said: "Alcohol is a depressant. It suppresses the stress response short-term. Then you rebound worse than baseline. It's borrowing calm from tomorrow." She said this with the casual expertise of a woman who'd lived with an addict and had read every pamphlet in every waiting room.

Marcus looked at her. "You're not wrong."

"I rarely am." No warmth in it. Just fact. Maria's humor was like that — razor-edged, delivered without a smile, requiring you to decide for yourself whether she was joking. She usually wasn't.

Dale, carving in his corner, said nothing. But I saw his jaw tighten.

---

The CB radio was a Cobra 29 in a carrying case with an external antenna. Marcus set it on a folding table and powered it on and the static filled the room — the white noise of a spectrum that used to carry a thousand conversations. We gathered around it the way people in another century would have gathered around a fire.

Marcus scanned. Most channels dead. Channel 9 — emergency — carried a faint automated loop:

"Shelter in place. Remain calm. Assistance is being coordinated."

"How long has it been saying that?" Sienna asked.

"Five days. Nobody's updated it."

The system generating the message still ran, but the people managing it were gone. The automated loop on Channel 9 was the sound of that belief dying. The government wasn't coordinating assistance. The government was a recording playing to empty rooms.

He kept scanning. Fragments — half-sentences, voices fading in and out. A man in Missouri. Gone by morning. A woman in Oklahoma reporting I-44 impassable. A group in Memphis coordinating evacuation south. Marcus had listened for them the next day. Nothing.

"Channel 21," he said. "This is the one."

Static. Then, faint, a woman's voice. Calm. Precise. The cadence of someone reading from notes:

"— repeat, the mechanism is endocrine. The organism's activation is triggered by sustained elevation of catecholamine levels — specifically epinephrine and norepinephrine —"

Static swallowed the rest. The signal broke. Marcus adjusted the dial, the antenna. Nothing.

"That's all?"

"She broadcasts twice a day. Morning, evening. The signal's weak — low-power transmitter. I've caught maybe six fragments in three days." He pulled a piece of paper from his jacket pocket — a page torn from a logbook, covered in his handwriting. "I've been writing down what I can catch."

The fragments, assembled:
- *"mechanism is endocrine"*
- *"beta-adrenergic antagonists are protective"*
- *"the organism's protein structures do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny"*
- *"this is not a mutation — this is not a bioweapon"*
- Something about a frequency — acoustic — that *"disrupts collective coordination"*
- A name: *"Dr. Eleanor Moss"*
- A reference to *"the campus"* and a state route number — 16

Marcus was watching me read. "The endocrine part," he said. "Catecholamine levels. That's adrenaline, right? Stress hormones?"

"Yes."

He was quiet for a moment. His hand went to the flask and then stopped.

"So when I walked here — when they looked at me and didn't do anything — that was because I was too —" He didn't finish the sentence. He didn't need to. Too sad. Too drunk. Too hollowed out to produce whatever chemical signature the organism was looking for.

"Your body was below the threshold," I said. "You weren't scared enough to trigger it."

He laughed. One short sound, not happy. "I wasn't scared because I didn't care if I died. That's what saved me." He looked at the flask. "My whole life people have been telling me I need to feel more. Get help, Marcus. Open up, Marcus. And it turns out the thing wrong with me is the reason I'm still here."

Nobody said anything. There was nothing to say to a man who'd just learned his survival was a side effect of his despair.

*Do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny.* I read that fragment three times.

"What does that mean?" Jim asked. He was standing in the doorway, arms folded. He'd been listening. "Terrestrial phylogeny."

"It means it's not from here," I said. "Phylogeny is — it's the family tree of life on Earth. Every living thing shares common ancestors. Bacteria, plants, animals — they're all related if you go back far enough. Dr. Moss is saying this organism doesn't fit anywhere on that tree. Its proteins don't match anything that evolved on this planet."

The room was quiet.

"Not a weapon," Jim said slowly. "Not a lab."

"No."

He sat down. Not in a chair — on the stairs, heavily, like the last structural support had been pulled out. For two weeks he'd been wrestling with God's silence in the face of human evil — somebody's weapon, somebody's carelessness, a cruelty God could have prevented. That was a theodicy he understood. Evil men do evil things and God allows free will and the faithful endure. But this. This wasn't human evil. This was something that had arrived from outside the frame entirely, something that had nothing to do with human sin or human choice or any of the categories his theology was built to handle.

"From where?" Ruth asked, from the top of the stairs.

I thought about the *Popular Science* article. Comet Voss. The meteor showers in September. Panspermia — life arriving on comets, seeding planets, a legitimate scientific hypothesis with real evidence behind it. The connection was so obvious and so enormous that I sat there for a full minute before I said it out loud.

"A comet," I said. "There was a comet. Voss. Earth passed through the edge of its tail in September. The meteor showers — everybody saw them. I read an article about it a month ago. If the organism arrived on cometary debris..."

Jim's hands were folded between his knees. He was staring at the floor the way he'd stared at the cross two nights ago — the same posture, the same stillness, but something behind it had shifted. The enemy he'd been praying against had just become something his prayers had no address for. You can't ask God to stop a comet that already passed.

"Well," he said finally. "I suppose that changes the sermon."

Nobody laughed. But something in the room loosened — the faintest crack in the weight — because Jim making a joke meant Jim was still Jim, and Jim still being Jim meant the news hadn't broken him, and that was worth more than the news itself.

State Route 16. It ran north through the Boston Mountains to the university towns on the other side. The University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A real research university with biology labs and equipment and, apparently, at least one scientist who was still doing science while the world ended.

"Fayetteville," Marcus said. "Sixty miles northwest. Through the mountains."

---

Marcus Webb's brain contained a three-dimensional map of every road, rest stop, warehouse, and distribution center within three hundred miles — fifteen years of routes most people never saw from the highway. More valuable than anything he carried.

"The Walmart's almost stripped," he said. We were in the basement, just the two of us. "I walked through it on my way here. Perishables spoiled. Canned goods half-depleted. Another week, bare shelves."

"Sienna found the military blockade," I said. "The Turned are feeding on the dead."

Marcus was quiet for a moment. Then: "How many bodies?"

"She counted six remaining. There were more."

"The interchange." He nodded, as if confirming something he'd already suspected. "High-traffic area. Lots of initial casualties. The Turned would drift there for the food. Which means the interchange is a feeding ground now, not just a concentration point."

"Could we drive through it?" I was still thinking like the old world — roads go places, cars are faster than walking. It seemed obvious.

"Drive." He said the word like I'd suggested we fly. "Kid, I need you to understand something about vehicles in this situation. A car engine is the loudest thing in a silent world. You fire up a truck and every Turned in a half-mile radius knows where you are. The highways are funnels — they concentrate everything into narrow corridors. Every interchange, every rest stop, every truck stop is a congregation point because those are the places people went when they were trying to get out, and those people are still there, and they're not people anymore."

He paused. Took a sip from the flask.

"You need to understand what happened on the highways that first night. Everybody's in their car. Everybody's got the radio on — the emergency broadcasts, the news, the same loop of *shelter in place* and *unexplained behavioral episodes* and nobody saying what's actually happening. People are scared. People who are scared drive fast. They tailgate, they swerve, they run red lights. The radio's telling them the world is ending and they're doing eighty in a sixty trying to get home to their families or get out of the city or just get *somewhere*, and their heart rates are through the roof, and the adrenaline is pumping, and —" He spread his hands. "You see where this goes. They turned at the wheel. Doing seventy, eighty miles an hour. The Turned don't know how to drive. They don't know how to brake. The car keeps going until it hits something — a guardrail, another car, the median. And then the next car hits that one. And the car behind that one. I saw a pileup on I-40 near Ozark that was thirty vehicles deep. Some of them were still running when I drove past, engines idling, wheels against guardrails, the drivers standing in the road with smooth faces."

He shook his head. "The highways didn't just fill up with Turned. They filled up with wrecks. The panic itself made the roads impassable before the Turned ever set foot on the asphalt. Every on-ramp is a bottleneck of crushed metal. Every bridge is a dam of jackknifed semis. You couldn't drive through it if the Turned weren't even there."

He paused again. "I drove for three days before I parked. The last ten miles I was threading between abandoned vehicles and clusters of Turned, and two of those clusters started massing up in a way I did not like. If I'd stalled, or hit something, or blown a tire — I'd be standing in a rest stop parking lot right now with a smooth face."

Roads weren't escape routes. Roads were traps — funnels that concentrated the Turned at every chokepoint, plugged with the wreckage of a million panicked drivers who turned at the wheel. Another assumption gone.

"So roads are out."

"What about flying?" Sienna said. She'd been listening from the stairs. "The airport. Drake Field. There have to be planes sitting there."

Marcus looked at her. "Can you fly?"

"No."

"Can anyone here fly?"

Silence.

"A Cessna 172 is louder than a truck. You'd need a runway clear of debris, fuel, and someone who knows how to take off without killing everyone on board. Landing same thing — you need a strip, you need to know the approach, you need to not stall. Flying isn't driving. You can't just figure it out." He paused. "I've hauled cargo to regional airports for fifteen years. I've watched pilots do their checklists. It looks simple from the outside. It's not."

"Clarksville Municipal is four miles south," I said. I'd already thought about it — of course I had. The idea was obvious. The idea was also useless. "Even if we got there, even if the runway was clear, even if we found a plane with fuel — none of us can fly. And crashing a Cessna into the Ozarks because we watched a YouTube video once is not a plan."

"It might be worth checking," Sienna said. "Eventually. If we find a pilot."

"If we find a pilot," Marcus agreed. "But we don't have one. So."

"Roads where people traveled are out. Back roads — farm roads, forest service roads — are better. Low traffic before, low density now. But even back roads connect to highways eventually, and the connection points are where it gets bad."

"What about off-road? Cross-country?"

"In what? My rig? A Humvee? The terrain between here and Fayetteville is the Boston Mountains. It's the roughest country in the state — sandstone bluffs, creek hollows, ravines. No vehicle short of a military crawler is getting through that. And a military crawler is the loudest thing you can drive."

He took a sip from his flask. Small. Measured. Not getting drunk — maintaining.

"There's a trail," he said. "The Ozark Highlands Trail. Runs through the national forest, mostly ridgelines. I've crossed it hauling timber loads — the forest service roads intersect it every ten, fifteen miles. Once you're up in the mountains, there's nothing. No population. No highways. The Turned go where people were. People weren't in the deep woods."

"You know the OHT?"

"I know every road that crosses it. Which means I know where you can get on and off." He looked at me. "It's sixty miles of mountain trail. With a seventy-two-year-old. In October. It's insane."

"Is there a better option?"

"No." He poured another measure into the flask cap. "That's the problem."

---

There was something about Marcus that I recognized but couldn't name until the third day. His calm wasn't like Jim's — effortful, maintained by faith and medication. It wasn't like mine — defensive, analytical. Marcus's calm was a hollowness. The flat affect of a man who had been too sad for too long to be afraid.

In game theory there's a concept called a dominant strategy — one that produces the best outcome regardless of what the other players do. Marcus's depression was his dominant strategy. The thing slowly destroying his life outside the apocalypse was keeping him alive inside it. He couldn't feel the acute terror the organism needed because something in him had broken years ago, right where the organism needed to reach.

He didn't talk about this. He talked about roads and supply chains. But on the third night, sitting in the basement after everyone else was asleep, he showed me something.

His phone. Dead, battery gone. He made the motion to turn it on anyway — nothing, black screen — and held it up.

"My daughter," he said. "Ava. She's nine. Tulsa. The lock screen was a photo of her at her birthday party. Purple frosting on her face."

He looked at the dead phone.

"The battery died and I still carry it. My ex-wife would say it's typical. 'Marcus holds onto things that don't work anymore.' She said that about our marriage and she was right." He put the phone back in his pocket. "Fayetteville is northwest. Tulsa is west. Every mile we walk toward Dr. Moss is a mile that isn't toward Ava. I know that. I'm doing it anyway because the math says Moss is the priority and I believe in the math. But I want you to know that the math is costing me something."

"I know."

"No, you don't. You're fifteen. You think sacrifice is a concept. It's not. It's walking the wrong way while knowing the right way exists." He capped the flask. "I hate roads. Did you know that? Fifteen years of driving and I hate every damn mile of highway I've ever seen. The white lines, the rest stops, the same Denny's in every truck stop in America. I hate it. And I know every road between here and Oklahoma like I know my own heartbeat because hating a thing and knowing it aren't mutually exclusive. Ask Jim about that — he'll tell you it's the same with faith."

I didn't know what to say. Marcus wasn't asking for comfort. He was putting something true into the record so that if he didn't make it to Tulsa, at least one person would understand what it cost him not to try.

"I'll put it in the journal," I said.

"Don't put in the crying part."

"You're not crying."

"I was going to. You interrupted." A beat. "That's a joke, kid. I make those sometimes. They're bad."

"You'll fit in. Jim's are worse."

---

On Thursday evening, Marcus caught another fragment from Dr. Moss. Clearer this time — she'd adjusted her antenna or the atmospheric conditions had shifted.

"— if you are receiving this, my name is Dr. Eleanor Moss. I am at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. I have data. I have a frequency. I have medication. If you can reach me —"

Static. Then, one more fragment:

"— every fortress is a countdown. Stay small. Stay quiet. Move before the density —"

Gone.

Every fortress is a countdown. I didn't fully understand what she meant — not yet. But I understood the math. The food was finite. The medication was finite. The Turned in the parking lot were not finite — fourteen today, twelve yesterday, nine the day before that. The number only went one direction. Whatever happened when enough of them gathered in one place, Moss knew and we didn't, and she was telling us not to be there when we found out.

"She's right," I said. "About the countdown. I don't know what happens when the density hits some kind of limit. But I know the numbers are climbing and the food is shrinking and those two lines cross eventually."

Jim said nothing for a long time. When he spoke, it wasn't agreement.

"Or we stay," he said. "We know this building. We know the area. The church has walls, a basement, a steeple for observation. We could plant in the spring — there's a garden plot behind the fellowship hall, good soil. We could scavenge further out as the Turned thin. Hunt — there's deer in those woods, turkey, squirrel. We could find a more defensible position if we need to — the old bank on Main Street has a vault, concrete walls, one entrance. We could build a fence. A real perimeter."

He wasn't being naive. He was being a pastor — a man whose identity was rooted in a place and a purpose, being asked to abandon both. The church was his. The sign in the window was his. Every person in this basement was alive because Jim Whittaker had put a sign in a window, and now a voice on a radio was telling him the window didn't matter.

"Jim," I said. "The density is climbing. Whatever Moss is warning us about —"

"A woman I've never met, on a radio signal I can barely hear, is telling me to walk sixty miles through mountains with a seventy-two-year-old woman. Based on fragments." He looked at me. "I'm not saying no. I'm saying not yet. Let me see how bad it gets."

He would see. The Lyles would show him exactly how bad it got. But that was weeks away, and Jim needed to arrive at the decision on his own terms, through his own evidence, and the evidence hadn't finished presenting itself.

Sienna, in the steeple, called down: "Another one just arrived in the parking lot. Fifteen now."

The number was growing. The clocks were running. And somewhere on the other side of the Boston Mountains, a woman with a radio and a lab was broadcasting into the dark, and we were the only ones listening.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #4:**

*Day 8. Seven people. Fifteen Turned. Counting up.*

*Sixty miles through the worst terrain in the state. Moss has answers. We have canned corn and a countdown. Jim has a garden plot and a bank vault and a faith that walls mean something.*

*He's not wrong to want to stay. He built this. Every person in this basement is alive because he put a sign in a window. But the numbers only go one direction, and the food only goes the other, and those two lines cross whether Jim believes in the intersection or not.*

*I can't make him leave. He has to see it for himself. I just hope what shows him isn't the thing that kills us.*
