# ACT ONE: INERTIA

# Chapter 1: The Sick Day

Here is a fact about me: I am fifteen years old, I weigh approximately one hundred and eighty pounds, and on the night the world ended I was six hours into a *Civilization VI* marathon as Gilgamesh of Sumeria because his War-Cart is overpowered in the Ancient Era and I needed something in my life to go well.

I was home sick. I was not sick.

I'd told my mom my stomach hurt, which she didn't believe because she's an ER nurse and can spot a fake symptom the way a mechanic can spot a bad alternator — by the sound it makes. She put her hand on my forehead in that way she does where she already knows you're lying but she's calculating whether the fight is worth it, and she decided it wasn't, and she left me a Sprite and a sleeve of Saltines on the counter and said, "I'm on at six. There's leftover pasta in the fridge. Don't stay up all night."

"I won't," I said, which we both knew was a lie but a small enough one that it didn't matter.

She left at 5:45 because she's always early. Night shift at Johnson Regional — she's been doing it for four years, Friday through Monday, twelve hours, because the differential pay is better and because, she says, "somebody has to be there when normal people are sleeping." We live in a single-wide in Shady Oaks Mobile Home Park off Route 22, and the night differential is the difference between a single-wide and sleeping in her car, so she works it. She's an ER nurse, which means she comes home smelling like hand sanitizer and talks about her patients in a language I only half understand. Triage. Bolus. Lactated Ringer's. She says these words over dinner and I absorb them without context, like vocabulary words from a country I've never visited.

At the door she did the thing she always does on Fridays. She turned back and pointed at me — not sternly, just pointed, like a little acknowledgment that we were both here and this was our routine and it was okay — and she said, "Happy Friday, bud."

"Happy Friday," I said, not looking up from my screen.

She left.

I want you to understand something about that moment, because I've replayed it more times than I've replayed anything in my life, and I replay a lot of things. I was sitting on the couch. My laptop was open. I had a half-eaten bag of Doritos balanced on a cushion next to me, and the orange dust was on the trackpad, and the trackpad was getting that sticky quality that means I should probably clean it but I wasn't going to. My mom said "Happy Friday, bud" and I said "Happy Friday" and I didn't look up.

I didn't look up.

That's not the important part of the story. But it's the part I can't stop thinking about.

By 11 PM I'd pushed past the Medieval Era and was working on a domination victory, which is where you win by conquering everybody, which sounds aggressive but is actually the most methodical victory type because it's all about positioning and logistics and knowing when to push and when to consolidate. I realize this is not critical information for what follows, but I'm going to be explaining a lot of things in detail going forward and you should probably get used to it.

The trailer was quiet the way it always is on Friday nights — just me and the furnace and the thin walls doing their thin-wall thing, which is to say I could hear Mr. Pembrook's TV two units down and the occasional car on Route 22 and the dogs at the far end of the park who bark at everything and nothing. Our trailer is a 1998 Fleetwood, two bedroom, one bath, with wood-grain paneling that hasn't been wood-grain since Clinton was president and a kitchen where the counter is eighteen inches from the stove, which means you can cook and wash dishes simultaneously if you don't mind burning your elbow. The lot is gravel. The skirting is vinyl. The walls are, charitably, insulated, which means in winter you can still hear your neighbor sneeze but at least you can't feel the wind doing it.

I'm describing this because later the geography of this park — seventeen occupied units in a U-shape off a gravel drive, community laundry building at the entrance, dumpster enclosure at the back, Route 22 on one side and a soybean field on the other — becomes the most important map I ever study. I need you to see it now, while it's still just a place where people live cheap and keep to themselves.

At 11:14 PM I heard sirens. Multiple. Not the single wail of an ambulance heading to Johnson Regional, which is basically white noise here — Route 22 is the ambulance corridor. This was layered. Three, four vehicles from different directions, overlapping, close and then far and then close again. I paused the game because the sound was interfering with my concentration, which tells you everything you need to know about my priorities at that moment.

My phone buzzed. AP News notification:

**PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECLARED IN MULTIPLE STATES — Details developing**

I opened it. The article was three facts and twelve paragraphs of nothing — something about "unexplained behavioral episodes," the CDC "coordinating with state health departments," citizens advised to shelter in place. The rest was filler. "Experts are monitoring the situation." "The White House released a statement expressing concern." Journalist code for: we know as much as you do, which is nothing, but we have to keep typing or they'll make us go outside.

I turned on the TV, which I should have done first, and which I'm telling you about second because I want to be honest about the order in which I processed the end of the world: phone, then Reddit, then television, because I am a child of my generation and the TV is my mom's thing and I literally had to look for the remote for three minutes before I found it under a couch cushion.

Local news was running continuous coverage, which sounds dramatic but mostly meant two anchors sitting at a desk looking increasingly uncomfortable while repeating the same five facts in different arrangements. Schools closed in the morning. The hospital was on diversion — no new patients. The National Guard had been activated, which they illustrated with stock footage of Humvees that could have been from any year. Between repetitions, they cut to reporters in other cities — Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles — all saying the same thing: something is happening, it's happening everywhere, nobody knows what it is. One segment from a station in Dallas showed cell phone footage of a man in a Walmart parking lot eating raw ground beef out of the package, standing upright, methodical, his face blank. The anchors cut away from it quickly. Nobody commented on it. It was just one more piece of the montage of wrongness, and at the time I didn't realize it was the most important thing they'd shown all night.

The global scope was the only real news, and it was staggering if you stopped to think about it, which I didn't, because at fifteen you don't really understand what "worldwide" means. It's an abstraction. It's a word on a map. Three blocks is not an abstraction. Three blocks is where you live.

I switched to Reddit. The front page was already a disaster. A megathread on r/all — "What is happening? Reports of mass behavioral changes worldwide" — had 30,000 upvotes and climbing. I scrolled. It was the same report over and over: *My neighbor is standing in his yard and won't respond. There are people outside who aren't moving. I saw someone get chased and then they just stopped and joined them.* Identical accounts from Portland and Houston and London and Lagos, ten thousand variations on the same three sentences. A few posts were different — stranger, harder to process. Someone in rural Oregon described affected individuals "gathering around a cattle trough and drinking from it like animals." A woman in suburban Atlanta posted that the man standing in her cul-de-sac had walked to her bird feeder, pulled out the seed tray, and eaten the contents, then gone back to standing. These posts had fewer upvotes. People didn't know what to do with them. They didn't fit the pattern everyone was building — the "standing still" pattern, the "herding" pattern — and so they got filed under "weird" and scrolled past. I scrolled past them too.

The conspiracy theories were growing like mold. In the first two hundred comments I counted: Chinese bioweapon, Russian bioweapon, 5G activation, Bill Gates depopulation agenda, punishment from God for gay marriage, punishment from God for not allowing gay marriage, nanobots in the water supply, leaked government experiment, mass formation psychosis, aliens, something about immigrants, something about Elon Musk, and — this one I remember because it was all caps — "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LET THEM TAKE THE GUNS." Everyone was explaining the thing they didn't understand by blaming the people they already hated. Nobody was describing what was actually happening because nobody knew what was actually happening, so they described their fears instead and called it information. This is, I would learn, what people do when the world stops making sense: they don't sit with the not-knowing. They fill it in with whatever was already in their heads. It's like a coloring book where the picture is blank but everyone brought their own crayons.

I wasn't any different. I had my own coloring book and my own crayons, and they were all labeled with things I'd absorbed from movies and games and late-night Wikipedia spirals. Some kind of virus, I figured. A fast-acting neurological thing — prion disease, maybe, or a weaponized pathogen. The affected people were sick. They were confused. They'd be disoriented for a while and then the CDC would figure it out and there'd be a vaccine or a treatment and the news cycle would move on. That was my framework: this is a medical emergency, it's scary but temporary, the adults with the degrees and the hazmat suits will handle it. Shelter in place meant wait it out. The system was overwhelmed but the system was still there.

I held onto that framework for about thirty-six more hours. It was wrong in every particular, but it was comfortable, and comfort is the thing you give up last.

I didn't find anything useful. I went back to my game.

Twenty minutes later I heard gunshots.

Not close — maybe a mile, maybe more, past Route 22 toward the highway. But distinct: the flat crack of a handgun, rapid, five or six shots. Then nothing. Then, from a different direction, more — a heavier sound, a rifle, three deliberate pops. In Arkansas you hear guns. Hunting season, target practice, someone shooting a copperhead in their yard. It's background noise. But this wasn't the right pattern. Hunting rifles are spaced — one shot, pause, one shot. Target practice is rhythmic. This was urgent. This was someone shooting at something they were afraid of, which is a different sound entirely, and I knew the difference even though I'd never consciously thought about it before.

My brain went straight to the movies. Barricade the doors. Find weapons. Head for the roof. Shoot anything that shuffles. That's the playbook for this, right? That's what you do when the sick people start walking around and the government says shelter in place. You board up and hold out and eventually the National Guard rolls in with Humvees and bullhorns. I'd seen this movie. Everybody's seen this movie.

The dogs at the end of the park were going insane. Barking, howling, the frantic kind that means something is wrong in a way that dogs understand and people pretend not to.

I paused the game. I went to the kitchen window. Our trailer faces the gravel drive, and from the kitchen I can see past the laundry building to Route 22. The road was empty. The streetlight at the park entrance was on, throwing its orange cone across the asphalt. Nothing was moving.

The gunshots didn't repeat. The dogs eventually stopped — not wound down, not tapered off. Stopped. All of them, within a few seconds of each other, mid-bark, as if something had arrived at their end of the park that was worse than whatever they'd been barking at. The silence after was a different kind of silence. The hair on my arms stood up — all of it, at once, a full-body prickling that I'd read about in books but never actually felt, and my stomach turned over slow and heavy like something rolling in deep water. I stood at the kitchen window and I didn't move and I barely breathed and I couldn't have told you what I was afraid of because I didn't know yet, but my body knew. My body had figured it out before my brain did. I went back to the couch.

On my desk, under the Doritos bag, was last month's issue of *Popular Science*. Cover story: Comet Voss and the unusually bright meteor showers it produced when Earth passed through the edge of its tail in September. I'd read the article during a 2 AM Wikipedia rabbit hole — one of those where you start with "what's the fastest animal" and end up reading about the Oort Cloud and panspermia, which is the theory that life on Earth might have originally arrived on comets and meteoroids. A legitimate scientific hypothesis with real evidence behind it. I thought the comet article was cool. I mentioned it to exactly no one. I had already forgotten about it.

I should not have forgotten about it.

But that comes later. Right now it's 2 AM on a Saturday morning in October in Arkansas, and I'm falling asleep on a couch in a single-wide trailer with a laptop on my chest and a mouth that tastes like Doritos, and outside, past the vinyl skirting and the gravel lot and the soybean field, the world is quietly, methodically ending, and I don't know, and for a few more hours that not-knowing is the most comfortable I will ever be again.

# Chapter 2: The View from the Window

I woke up because the laptop was overheating on my chest and the fan was making a noise like a small animal dying. The screen had gone to sleep. The game was paused. Sunlight was coming through the living room blinds in those horizontal stripes that mean mid-morning, and I lay there for a minute in that groggy state where you know you fell asleep somewhere you weren't supposed to, and my first thought was: *Mom's going to be annoyed about the couch.*

My second thought was: *Mom's not here.*

I sat up. The trailer had that specific quality it gets when no one else has been in it for a while — not dirty or cold, just still. But it was more than that, and I want to be precise about this because it becomes important later: the trailer felt wrong. Not haunted-wrong, not spooky. Just... uncalibrated. My mom's presence is what makes this place a home instead of a metal box. Her coffee mug on the counter. Her reading glasses on the arm of the chair. The smell of whatever she cooked last still hanging in the air. All of those things were still there, but they were artifacts now — evidence of a person who should be here and wasn't — and the trailer had shifted from "home" to "the place where my mom's stuff is." I didn't have language for this feeling at the time. I do now: it's the feeling of a room that's lost its organizing principle. Everything is where it should be and none of it means what it meant yesterday.

The Sprite she'd left me was warm on the counter. The Saltines were still in their sleeve, right where she'd put them, lined up neat next to the Sprite because that's how she does things — she arranges. Even when she's tired, even when she's running late, she lines things up for me before she goes. I looked at the Saltines and the Sprite sitting there in their neat little arrangement and something behind my ribs did a thing I didn't have a name for, a contraction, like a fist closing around nothing, and I had to look away. She should be here. That was the whole thought: she should be here. It wasn't complicated. It wasn't analytical. It was just a kid standing in a kitchen at 9:42 in the morning understanding, for the first time but not the last, that "should" doesn't mean anything anymore.

Her keys weren't on the hook by the door.

She should have been home by seven. It was 9:42.

I called her. Straight to voicemail. Her voicemail message is the one she recorded four years ago, and she says her name wrong — "You've reached Delia Carver" — except she stumbles on "Carver" because she'd only had the name back for six months after the divorce and it still felt new in her mouth. I've heard this voicemail probably three hundred times. I never mentioned the stumble.

I called again. Voicemail.

I texted: **u ok? still at work?**

I put the phone down and went to the kitchen. Cereal. Frosted Mini-Wheats, same box as last night, because I am nothing if not consistent. I ate standing at the counter because I didn't want to go back to the couch, which is a weird instinct I couldn't have explained — like the couch was where Last Night Nate lived and the kitchen was where Saturday Morning Nate lived and I needed to be the version of myself who eats breakfast at the counter like a functioning person.

---

The TV was still on from last night, muted. I unmuted it.

Local news, continuous coverage. The two anchors from last night had been replaced by a morning team who looked like they'd been called in early and hadn't had time to do whatever it is anchors do to their faces. They were repeating the same loop: schools closed, shelter in place, National Guard activated, hospitals on diversion. But the scope had changed overnight. The ticker at the bottom was scrolling cities: New York, London, Tokyo, Mumbai, São Paulo, Lagos, Berlin, Sydney. Whatever this was, it wasn't regional. It wasn't national. It was everything, everywhere, all at once, and the news was handling this the way news always handles things it doesn't understand: by reporting on how much of it there was instead of what it was. "The crisis has now been reported in over forty countries." Great. What crisis? "Authorities worldwide are urging calm." Wonderful. Calm about what?

They cut to a reporter standing in front of a hospital in Little Rock. Behind her, the parking lot was full and there were people milling around the entrance in a way that looked wrong but that I couldn't articulate yet. She was saying something about "overwhelmed emergency departments" and "unprecedented patient volume" and then the camera shifted slightly and in the background, behind a parked ambulance, I saw two people standing perfectly still while everyone else moved around them. They were facing the camera. They weren't blinking. The reporter didn't notice them. The camera cut away.

I stood there with my cereal and watched the TV and had the feeling you get when you're playing a game and you've just uncovered a section of the map and the fog of war has pulled back and what's underneath is worse than what you imagined, but also somehow less dramatic — not a massed army, just a landscape that's subtly, fundamentally wrong.

---

From the kitchen window I could see across the gravel drive to the other units. The park was quiet. Not peaceful-quiet — held-breath-quiet. The kind of quiet where the absence of sound is itself a sound, a pressure in your ears that tells you something is missing.

Mr. Pembrook was standing in his lot.

Mr. Pembrook lived three units down, a retired mail carrier, sixty-something, drank Busch Light on his steps and had opinions about the park management that he shared with anyone who came within range. My mom called him "harmless" in a tone that meant she'd considered the alternatives. Every morning he came out in his green terrycloth bathrobe — the one that was missing the belt — to get his mail or just stand there with a cigarette and squint at the sky like he was deciding whether to approve of the weather.

He was wearing the bathrobe now. He was standing in the gravel between his trailer and the next one, in the sunniest part of the lot — the one spot where the morning light came between the two units without shadow. The bathrobe was open and he wasn't wearing anything under it. I want to be clear about this because it mattered and I noticed and I'm trying to be honest about what I noticed: Mr. Pembrook was standing outside in October with his bathrobe hanging open and he was completely exposed, and it was not something he would ever have done, not because he was modest but because Mr. Pembrook was a man with a very specific sense of what was and wasn't acceptable in a public space, and standing naked in the lot was not acceptable, and the fact that he was doing it anyway meant that the part of him that knew the difference was gone.

He was just standing there. Not getting his mail. Not smoking. Both hands at his sides. Facing the drive. Not moving. The bathrobe flapped a little in the breeze and he didn't reach for it.

I watched him for maybe a minute, chewing cereal, waiting for him to do something. He didn't do anything. My first thought was that he was sick — whatever was overwhelming the hospital had gotten to Pembrook. Some kind of neurological thing, a fugue state, maybe a stroke. He'd stand there for a while and then he'd snap out of it or collapse, and when the ambulances started running again someone would take him to Johnson Regional and they'd figure out what was wrong. That was the frame I put around it: a sick old man in a bathrobe. Temporary. Fixable. But there was evidence around him that he'd done something during the night. The spigot on the side of his trailer was dripping — not broken-dripping, turned-on-and-not-quite-closed dripping. There was a wet streak on the gravel below it. And his garbage can, which had been upright by his steps yesterday, was on its side, the bag torn open, contents scattered. It could have been raccoons. We got raccoons sometimes. But the bag wasn't shredded the way raccoons shred things — it was pulled open from the top, the way a person would open it, and some of the contents were missing and others were spread across the gravel as if someone had sorted through them. I noticed this. I didn't understand it yet.

The lot across from his: empty. The Garcias' truck was gone — they'd left, or they were already at work when it started, or something else. Two units down from Pembrook, Mrs. Watts's door was closed, curtains drawn. Sienna Okafor's place, two lots over from ours: porch light on, no movement. The laundry building at the park entrance: door ajar, lights off. Route 22 beyond it: nothing.

I stood at the window and catalogued all of this without knowing I was cataloguing it. In *Civ*, the beginning of every playthrough is the same: you have one settler, one warrior, and a circle of visible terrain surrounded by fog of war. Everything outside that circle is unknown. The first thing you do — always, before you build, before you commit to anything — is remove the fog. You explore. You figure out what's around you. Because committing before you understand the map is how you lose the game in fifty turns.

I wasn't consciously applying this. I was eating cereal and looking out a window. But part of me was already doing it: noting anomalies. Filing them. The fog was pulling back, and what was underneath was very wrong, and I was the only one looking.

My lower back was killing me. I'd been standing at the window for over an hour, which doesn't sound like much except that I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds and my body is not designed for sustained anything — not standing, not walking, not sitting in one position. I shifted. I leaned against the counter. I needed to pee but I didn't want to leave the window because leaving the window meant losing data, and also because the bathroom has no window and the idea of being in a room where I couldn't see outside had become suddenly, unreasonably terrifying. I held it for another twenty minutes and then gave up because biology beats strategy every time, and I was in the bathroom for forty-five seconds and the whole time my heart was doing a thing where it beat too hard and too fast, not from fear exactly but from the awareness that I couldn't see, that the world could change in forty-five seconds and I wouldn't know, and when I got back to the window nothing had changed but the relief was physical, a loosening in my chest, and I hated that I needed a window this much already.

---

I tried my mom again at 10:15, 10:30, and 10:47. Voicemail, voicemail, voicemail. I texted twice more. I called Johnson Regional main line and got a recording: "Thank you for calling Johnson Regional Medical Center. Due to an unprecedented volume of patients, we are unable to take your call at this time. If this is a life-threatening emergency, please dial 911. Please do not come to the emergency department unless your condition requires immediate medical attention. We appreciate your patience during this difficult time." It was the most polite way I'd ever been told that the hospital was drowning.

I tried the internet again. It was still working — the infrastructure was fine, the cell towers and fiber optics didn't care about behavioral crises — but the content had gotten worse. The Reddit megathread had passed 100,000 comments and fractured into chaos. The useful observations were buried under an avalanche of panic and ideology. A commenter with a medical username had posted a detailed theory about prion disease and gotten two thousand upvotes and a hundred replies explaining why it was wrong. Someone was insisting it was the vaccine. Someone else was insisting it was the people who didn't get the vaccine. A long post about chemtrails had been gilded three times. Someone had posted cell phone video from what looked like a suburb in Ohio — a woman being slowly surrounded by four people walking toward her in perfect synchronization — and the top comment was "obviously staged."

The news sites were worse. Not because the servers were failing but because the reporters had nothing new to say and were required to keep saying it. CNN had updated its main article six times. Each update was longer and less informative than the last, bulked out with quotes from officials who were saying "we're monitoring the situation" in increasingly creative ways. The pattern was global: same reports from every continent, same behavioral descriptions, same total absence of explanation. The world's entire information infrastructure was functioning perfectly, and the information it was transmitting was: *We don't know. We don't know. We don't know.*

I am not a person who panics. I want to be clear about this because I think people imagine that when something bad happens, everyone either panics or doesn't, and the people who don't are brave and the people who do are weak, and that's not how it works. I didn't panic because panicking wasn't what my body wanted to do. My body wanted to sit on the couch and gather information and wait for someone to tell me what was happening, because that's what my body always wants to do. I am built for inertia the way some people are built for action. This is not a virtue. It just happens to be a fact.

But I was scared. I was scared the way you get scared when you're watching a loading bar stuck at 83% and you know something's wrong but you can't figure out what. My mom wasn't home. My mom was always home by seven.

I tried her one more time. Voicemail.

---

At 2:15 my phone buzzed hard — an emergency alert, the kind that overrides Do Not Disturb and makes that sound that always makes me flinch:

**EMERGENCY ALERT: Shelter in place. Lock all doors and windows. Avoid contact with individuals displaying altered behavior. Do NOT approach. Do NOT attempt to restrain.**

I checked the locks. Front door — locked, already locked, Mom always locks it. Back door — locked. The windows were the cheap crank kind that barely sealed when they were closed; I cranked them tight. I closed the blinds in the bedroom and bathroom. In the living room I left them cracked just enough to see the drive.

I sat on the couch. The TV was still running its loop. Mr. Pembrook was still in his lot. The afternoon light was going flat and grey.

Then I noticed something that made my stomach clench. One of the two strangers by the laundry building had drifted closer. Not toward me specifically — toward this end of the park, toward the row of trailers where mine was. And I thought about what I'd been observing all day: how they oriented toward sound, how their heads tracked noise. The TV had been on for hours. It wasn't loud — my mom kept the volume low because the walls are thin and she was considerate about that — but it was the only sound in the park besides the wind and the occasional creak of siding. In this silence, even a low murmur of newscasters carried.

I turned it off. The click of the power button was the loudest thing in the trailer. The screen went dark and the silence rushed in like water filling a hole, and I sat there in the quiet and felt the absence of the one thing that had been connecting me to a world where people still talked and explained and tried to make sense of things. The TV had been a tether. Cutting it was the first time I chose the world outside the window over the world I wanted to still be living in.

The stranger by the laundry building stopped drifting. After a few minutes she turned and walked back toward the entrance. I couldn't prove causation. But I didn't turn the TV on again.

And the trailer was doing the thing again — the wrongness, the uncalibrated feeling that had nothing to do with the Turned and everything to do with absence. My mom should have been asleep in her bedroom by now, the way she always is on Saturday afternoons — blackout curtains drawn, white noise machine running, the particular domestic silence of a place where someone is sleeping and you're trying to be quiet for them. Instead: nobody to be quiet for. The white noise machine was off and the silence was the wrong shape. Her bedroom door was open and the bed was made, which meant she'd made it Friday morning before her shift and no one had touched it since, and it looked like a display, like a bed in a store, a bed nobody sleeps in.

I was fifteen years old and alone in a trailer and the world outside was broken and the world inside was broken in a different way — not dangerous, just empty, emptied of the person who made it make sense — and I sat in the silence and felt both kinds of broken at once. Too old to be this useless. Too young to fix anything. That's the spot I was in — the dead zone between helplessness and capability where all you can do is observe, and observing without the power to act is its own kind of suffering that nobody warns you about.

---

The afternoon passed. The TV stopped looping and started getting worse.

By 2 PM the local anchors were gone — replaced by a national feed that was pulling in footage from everywhere. Most of it was the same: empty streets, Turned standing in clusters, the eerie synchronization of their movements. But some of it was different, and the different stuff was what stuck. A traffic camera in Houston showed a group of Turned gathered around a fire hydrant that had been knocked open — one of them crouching, face in the stream of water, drinking. Not cupping their hands. Not bending to a fountain. Drinking the way an animal drinks, face-down, sustained. The anchor talked over it without mentioning it, as if the footage was just B-roll and the drinking wasn't the point. A news helicopter in Phoenix filmed what appeared to be Turned inside a grocery store — visible through the shattered front windows, moving between aisles, pulling things off shelves and consuming them standing up. The helicopter footage ran for maybe forty seconds before they cut away to an expert panel that had nothing to say.

I was watching. I was building a picture I didn't want to see. They drank. They ate. They were not statues. They were not frozen. They were — something. Organisms. Things with needs. The standing, the stillness, the blank faces — that was their resting state, their default. But they had other states. They got thirsty. They got hungry. They maintained themselves.

Mr. Pembrook had moved. Not far — he'd drifted about ten feet from his previous position and was now closer to the spigot on the side of his trailer. As I watched, he reached out and turned the handle. Water ran. He bent to it, put his mouth to the stream, and drank for about fifteen seconds. Then he turned the handle back — not all the way, leaving it dripping — and returned to his position. The whole sequence was mechanical, purposeful, utterly without the self-consciousness that a human being would bring to the act of drinking from a garden hose in their front yard in an open bathrobe. He needed water. He got water. He went back to waiting.

I'd been telling myself they were deteriorating. Confused, disoriented, running on fumes — they'd wander around for a day or two and then collapse, and the CDC or whoever would come through and clean it up. That was the comfortable version. The version where this was a medical crisis with a timeline and an ending.

The woman eating green tomatoes off the vine killed that version. This was the moment I understood, without having the language for it yet, that these things were not going to just stop. They were not going to stand there until they fell over. They were taking care of themselves, the way any living thing takes care of itself, and whatever was running them had figured out — already, within the first twenty-four hours — how to keep the machinery going.

I ate Frosted Mini-Wheats and monitored the drive through the blinds and thought about this.

At some point in the afternoon I heard more gunshots — closer this time, maybe half a mile, the direction of the subdivisions on the other side of Route 22. A burst of rapid handgun fire, then a gap, then two heavier rifle shots, then shouting that I could hear but not understand, and then nothing. The dogs at the far end of the park had been silent all day. They hadn't barked since last night, when they'd all stopped at once. I didn't see any dogs in the park. I didn't see any dogs anywhere. I tried not to think about what that meant.

At 7 PM, with the light almost gone, I checked the news one more time. The FEMA website had posted an updated advisory:

**SHELTER IN PLACE. Lock all doors and windows. Avoid contact with individuals displaying altered behavior. Do NOT approach. Do NOT attempt to restrain. Avoid strenuous physical activity and high-stress situations. Remain calm.**

*Avoid strenuous physical activity and high-stress situations.* I read that three times. It was specific in a way the earlier alert wasn't — and specific in a way that made no sense in the context of a normal emergency. Why would FEMA care about your stress level? Why would physical activity matter? In a fire you run. In a tornado you take cover. In a flood you get to high ground. In all of those emergencies, strenuous physical activity is what keeps you alive. Why was this one different?

I didn't figure it out that night. But I remembered it. And remembering it, later, kept me alive.

The movie in my head was still running — the one where you board up, hold out, and the cavalry arrives. But the movie was starting to skip. In the movie, FEMA tells you to shelter in place because help is coming. They don't tell you to manage your stress level. In the movie, the sick people shamble and deteriorate and fall down eventually. They don't eat from gardens and drink from hoses and sort through garbage with the efficiency of someone who plans to be here next week. The movie was wrong. I didn't know how wrong yet.

I ate the leftover pasta cold, standing at the kitchen counter in the dark. It was my mom's recipe — garlic, tomatoes, the cheap pasta from Dollar General that she insists tastes the same as the expensive kind, and she's right. It tasted like Tuesday, which was when she made it, which was three days ago, which was a different century.

I washed the fork and put it in the drying rack because that's what she does, and the act of doing this one normal thing in her absence was either comforting or devastating and I couldn't tell which.

# Chapter 3: The Thing Mr. Pembrook Did

Sunday. Day two. I didn't turn the TV on. I'd killed it yesterday after realizing the sound was drawing attention, and in the dark hours of the morning the memory of that drifting stranger — the one who'd been walking toward my end of the park while the newscasters murmured — was enough to keep my hand off the remote. Instead I checked my phone, volume at zero, brightness low.

The coverage had changed. The news sites had shifted from "we don't know what's happening" to "here is more of what's happening and we still don't know why." The scope was confirmed: every continent, every major city, the same phenomenon. The details were getting stranger. A BBC article described Turned in London entering a Tesco through broken windows and consuming food directly off the shelves. A wire service report from Japan mentioned groups of Turned standing knee-deep in rivers, faces down, drinking. An Australian outlet, with clinical understatement, reported that Turned in rural Queensland were killing and consuming livestock in ways described as "methodical."

The FEMA site had posted a new advisory at 4 AM. The crawl read: **AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS RETAIN BASIC BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. DO NOT ASSUME THEY WILL BECOME INCAPACITATED WITHOUT INTERVENTION. CONTINUE TO SHELTER IN PLACE.**

*Do not assume they will become incapacitated.* I read that three times. It meant: don't wait for them to fall over. It meant someone at FEMA had realized what I was starting to realize — that these things were eating and drinking and maintaining themselves, and waiting them out was not a plan.

I'd slept in my mom's bed. Her room is at the back of the trailer, away from the drive, with the one window that faces the soybean field where nobody goes. I took her pillow because it smelled like her shampoo — the coconut kind from Dollar General — and that was sentimental and I'm not going to apologize for it.

The trailer was worse in the morning. Not structurally worse — the same thin walls, the same vinyl floor, the same countertop with the burn mark from when I put a hot pan down without a trivet and she didn't yell at me, just looked at the mark and sighed and said, "Well, now it has character." All of that was still there. But the systems that made it a home were unwinding. The coffee maker hadn't run because nobody set it. The bathroom smelled like my soap, not hers. Her reading glasses were on the arm of the chair at the exact angle she'd left them, and they would stay at that angle forever now, or until I moved them, and either option felt like a violation. The trailer was becoming a museum of Friday, October 24th — the last day someone lived here instead of just surviving here — and every unchanged object was a timestamp marking the moment the world split.

I ate cereal. I went to the window.

---

Mr. Pembrook was in the same spot. I don't mean he'd gone inside and come back out. I mean he had been standing in the gravel between his unit and the next one, in his open bathrobe, in the same position, for what was now approaching twenty hours. A human being does not stand in one place for twenty hours. I knew this. My brain tagged it and put it in the box where I was keeping things that didn't make sense yet.

The park had changed overnight. Two more figures had appeared — strangers, nobody I recognized, standing near the laundry building at the park entrance. Same posture as Pembrook: still, hands at sides, facing inward. They'd come from Route 22, maybe, drawn to the park the way water is drawn to low ground. Three of them now, spaced across the park in a triangle that I didn't recognize as geometry yet but that some part of my brain was already noting.

I had my mom's bird-watching binoculars. She'd bought them three years ago during a brief and unsuccessful attempt to develop a hobby that wasn't work. They were good binoculars — 10x42, the kind that pull in a lot of light — and through them I could see details.

Mr. Pembrook's face. I focused on it for a full minute, looking for something I couldn't name. And I found it, though I didn't understand what I was finding. His expression was blank — not relaxed the way a sleeping face is blank, but smooth. Neutral in a way that human faces don't naturally achieve. We always carry something in our faces, even at rest — tension in the jaw, a crease between the brows, the residue of the last emotion that passed through. Pembrook's face carried nothing. It was a face at absolute zero. And it was wrong the way a wax figure is wrong: everything in the right place, nothing behind it.

The two by the laundry building had the same quality. I panned the binoculars across their faces and felt something cold move through my chest — not panic, not quite. More like the feeling you get when you're in a game and you realize the AI has been making moves you didn't see, and the board is not what you thought it was.

One other thing. I almost didn't note it, and I'm glad I did. All three of them — Pembrook and the two strangers — were facing the same direction. East. Toward the morning sun. Their faces were tilted up slightly, like people at a beach, and the sunlight was falling directly on their skin. As I watched over the next hour, they shifted. Not their positions — their orientation. As the sun moved, they turned with it. Not dramatically, not all at once. Just a slow, collective reorientation, like sunflowers on a time-lapse. I wrote this down in my notebook: *They face the sun. Don't know why.* I still don't know why. But Dr. Moss, when I eventually told her about it, put her pen down and stared at me for a long time and then said, "How early did you notice that?" and when I said "Day two," she said something under her breath that I think was "Jesus Christ" but might have been something else.

I was removing the fog of war. I didn't like what was underneath.

I panned the binoculars across the park. Slow. Methodical. Taking inventory.

One of the strangers by the laundry building had moved. Not far — she'd drifted maybe twenty feet toward the Garcias' empty trailer, and she was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched, the way you'd crouch to look at something on the ground. I focused.

She was eating.

The Garcias had a garden — a small one, three raised beds along the side of their unit, tomatoes and peppers mostly, the kind of thing you grow when you're trying to save money on groceries. The plants were still producing in late October, the last ragged tomatoes hanging on the vine. The woman was pulling them off and eating them whole — not biting, not chewing with any apparent process, just putting them into her mouth and working her jaw. Green ones, ripe ones, it didn't matter. She ate methodically, without pleasure or haste, the way a machine processes fuel. When the tomatoes were gone she moved to the pepper plants and ate those too. Then she stood up, turned, and walked back to her position near the laundry building. Resumed standing. The whole thing had taken about four minutes.

I watched this through the binoculars and I felt something shift in my understanding — a click, like a gear engaging. They weren't statues. They weren't frozen. They were organisms. They had needs. They ate, they drank — I'd watched Pembrook drink from his spigot yesterday — and between the eating and the drinking they stood in their positions and waited. Waited for what? For us. For anyone who was still in there, still human, still capable of being scared.

But they took care of themselves while they waited. That was the part that scared me most. Not the herding, not the blank faces. The fact that they ate. Because a thing that eats is a thing that plans to keep going, and a thing that plans to keep going is not a thing that's going to stop.

At approximately 8 AM, Ricky Sims three lots over started his truck.

Ricky was mid-twenties, worked at the Tyson plant, drove a black F-150 with a Confederate flag sticker on the tailgate that my mom said she "chose not to have feelings about." He came out his front door moving fast, keys in one hand, a duffel bag in the other. He threw the bag in the bed, got in, and cranked the engine. The truck roared to life and the sound was enormous in the silence — the first mechanical noise I'd heard since I turned the TV off.

All three Turned moved at once.

Not toward Ricky — toward the sound. Their heads swiveled in unison, smooth, tracking, the way a security camera follows motion. Then they began walking. Toward the truck. Not fast. The same steady, unhurried pace — maybe two miles an hour — that I would come to understand was their default. They don't rush. They never rush. Rushing is a human behavior and they are not that anymore.

Ricky saw them. He did what Ricky would do: he revved the engine, threw it in reverse, and peeled out of his lot in a spray of gravel. The truck fishtailed on the drive, straightened, and blew past the laundry building toward Route 22. The two by the entrance didn't try to block him. They turned their heads and watched him go.

He made it. He was gone. The three Turned stood in the positions they'd drifted to during their walk toward the noise, and after about a minute they drifted back to their original spots, like balloons returning to rest after a breeze.

I stored this under "weird shit that will probably matter": they oriented toward noise. They moved toward it. They didn't pursue a fast-moving target. They returned to positions afterward.

One more thing from that sequence. When the truck engine roared, before the Turned started walking, Pembrook's face changed. I had the binoculars on him and I saw it: a grin. Not a smile — a *grin*, sudden and wide and wrong, too many teeth, the corners of his mouth pulled back further than a mouth should go. It lasted maybe five seconds, from the moment the engine noise spiked to the moment Ricky's truck was already accelerating away. Then it faded — smoothed back to the blank, the neutral, the nothing. It happened fast enough that I almost convinced myself I'd imagined it. I hadn't imagined it. I would see that grin again, much closer, much worse, in about two hours.

The next two hours were quiet. I watched the park through the binoculars and scrolled my phone between observations. The news sites were updating less frequently now — fewer reporters, fewer updates, the same information reshuffled — but social media was still churning. A video from Chicago had gone viral overnight: a group of Turned moving through what looked like an open-air market, pulling food from stalls, eating standing up. One of them carried a whole watermelon under its arm for about thirty seconds, then stopped, smashed it on the pavement, and crouched over the pieces. The video was forty seconds long and had eleven million views and the top comment was just "what the fuck" with two hundred thousand upvotes, which was about right.

In the park, Mr. Pembrook had moved to the dumpster enclosure and was going through the communal garbage. I watched through the binoculars as he pulled out a trash bag, tore it open with both hands, and sorted through the contents. He ate something — I couldn't tell what, the angle was wrong — and discarded the rest. In the morning light, with the binoculars at full magnification, I noticed something about his skin that I hadn't seen the day before. On his face and forearms — the sun-exposed skin — there was a faint discoloration. Not bruising. Not sunburn. More like a stain under the surface, a dull greenish-grey that I might have mistaken for a trick of the light except that it was only on the parts of him that had been facing the sun. I didn't know what to do with that information so I wrote it down in my notebook and drew a circle around it, which is what I do when something seems important but I can't explain why. It didn't mean anything to me. It meant something to Dr. Moss, later, and what it meant was the worst news anyone had ever received, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

He walked back to his lot, that steady two-mile-an-hour pace, and resumed standing. The two by the laundry building hadn't moved.

They were on Day Two of existing, and they'd already figured out garbage.

At around 10 AM, Lisa Anderson came out of her trailer.

---

I was still operating on the zombie-movie framework. The one thing I thought I knew — the one thing every movie agrees on — is how it spreads: contact. Bites. Scratches. Bodily fluids. You get too close, they grab you, teeth or fingernails break skin, and that's it. Which meant that if you stayed behind walls and didn't let them touch you, you were safe. The walls were enough. The lock on the door was enough. Time was on your side because they were deteriorating and help was coming and as long as nobody got bit, everybody still inside their trailers was going to be fine.

I was about to watch that framework collapse in three minutes.

I have to talk about the Andersons for a minute.

The Andersons lived four units from us, at the bend in the U where the drive curves. Terry and Lisa. He drove a delivery truck for a feed company. She worked the register at Family Dollar. They argued loudly enough and often enough that everyone in the park knew the shape of their marriage — the fights about money, the silences that followed, the way their screen door banged when one of them walked out to cool down. My mom, who knew more about them than she'd say, once told me, "People are doing their best, Nate. Sometimes their best is loud."

Terry had left yesterday. I'd heard the argument through the walls — not the words, just the geometry of it, the rising and falling tones that meant one wanted to go and one wanted to stay — and then his truck pulling out, fast, down the drive and onto Route 22. He hadn't come back.

Lisa came out at 10 AM on Sunday morning. She was on the phone — I could see her lips moving, her free hand gesturing the way people gesture when they're arguing with someone who can't see them. She was pacing the small concrete pad in front of her door, three steps one way, three steps back, the phone pressed to her ear.

She was loud. Not screaming — just upset, the kind of loud that comes from fear and frustration and twenty-four hours of not knowing where your husband is.

Mr. Pembrook's head turned.

The two by the laundry building oriented.

I watched them begin to move — slow, steady, converging — and I felt something tighten in my throat and I pressed the binoculars harder against my face and I didn't look away.

---

What happened next took about three minutes. I need to describe it carefully because understanding this is important and getting it wrong could kill you.

The three Turned walked toward Lisa Anderson's lot. They didn't approach from the same direction — they spread, one coming down the drive, two angling between trailers on either side. It wasn't random. It was geometry. They were positioning themselves to cut off the exits from her lot, which had three ways out: the drive in front, and the gaps between her trailer and the ones on either side. By the time Lisa noticed them, two of the three gaps were closed.

She noticed when Pembrook came around the corner of the trailer next to hers. He was maybe twenty feet away, still walking, still steady, bathrobe open, that smooth blank face pointed at her. She stopped pacing. She lowered the phone.

"Earl?" she said. That was Pembrook's first name. I didn't know that until she said it. "Earl, what are you — why aren't you wearing—"

Then Pembrook did something.

He smiled.

I need to be very precise about this. He smiled, but the smile was wrong. It was too wide. It involved too many muscles, pulled back too far, showing too much teeth in a way that didn't correspond to any human emotion I'd ever seen on a face. It was like a grin that someone had described to a thing that had never grinned before — all the mechanical components present, the angle of the lips, the exposure of the teeth, but assembled by something that didn't understand what the expression was supposed to mean. It was a lure. A thing shaped like reassurance that was the opposite of reassurance, and the uncanny valley of it — the almost-rightness that was worse than outright wrongness — hit me through the binoculars like a physical force.

Lisa screamed.

She ran. Back through the gap that was still open, between her trailer and the empty unit behind it. She was in pajama pants and bare feet on gravel and she was running flat out, arms pumping, the phone flying out of her hand and skittering across the lot. The scream was continuous — not words, just the sound of a person whose fear has exceeded language.

The three Turned followed. Walking. Always walking. But more Turned were coming now — I could see them appearing between trailers, drawn by the scream. Two from the far end of the park. One from Route 22. They materialized the way background characters appear in a game when you trigger an event — suddenly present, as if they'd been waiting in the render distance.

Lisa ran down the narrow strip of dead grass between the back row of trailers and the chain-link fence that separated the park from the soybean field. She ran toward the dumpster enclosure at the end, and for a second I thought she'd go over the fence — it was four feet, chain-link, she could have climbed it — but there were two more on the other side. They'd come through the field. The soybean rows were high enough to hide them and they'd been there, waiting, or drawn by the noise, and now they were standing at the fence line and the fence was not going to help.

Lisa stopped. She was in the corner of the park — dumpster enclosure on one side, fence on the other, six Turned closing from the drive side. No exit. She pressed her back against the dumpster enclosure and she was screaming and her bare feet were on cold gravel and I was standing at my window watching through binoculars and I could not help her and I knew I could not help her and I did not try.

I need you to understand that I didn't not-try because I was calculating. I didn't not-try because I'd assessed the odds and decided the risk exceeded the benefit. I didn't not-try because I was playing a game. I didn't try because I was fifteen and I weighed a hundred and eighty pounds and I couldn't run fifty yards without wheezing and there were six of them and one of me and the space between my window and her was forty feet of open gravel and if I opened my door I would die the same way she was about to die, and knowing this — knowing it clearly, instantly, without doubt — is the kind of knowledge that costs something even when it saves you.

The Turned closed in. Not fast. Patient. The ones in front wore that grin — that wrong, wide, too-many-teeth grin that flickered across their faces like a signal, like a welcome sign in a language nobody alive spoke. The closer they got, the wider the grins got, and Lisa was shaking, her whole body vibrating, and the screaming had turned to a high, thin sound that wasn't screaming anymore, it was something more animal than that, and then—

She stopped.

Not stopped moving. Stopped being what she was. It happened in her face first. A slackening, a smoothing, as if a hand had passed over her features and wiped them clean. Then her posture changed — the tension went out of her shoulders, her hands unclenched, her spine straightened. The shaking stopped. Her breathing, which had been ragged and desperate, went slow and even, like someone had adjusted a dial.

And then the grin.

It spread across Lisa Anderson's face the same way it had spread across Pembrook's — too wide, too many teeth, an expression that had no emotion behind it, a mechanical event masquerading as joy. It lasted maybe thirty seconds. Her eyes were wide and fixed and her mouth was stretched into something that looked like ecstasy if you'd never seen ecstasy and were working from a description. Then it faded. Slowly, like a tide going out. The grin receded to a flat line, and then past it, to nothing. The blank. The absolute zero.

Lisa Anderson straightened up. She walked — calmly, steadily, barefoot on the gravel — to where the nearest group of Turned was standing. She joined them. They reoriented. They faced the drive. After a minute the others drifted back to their positions, and the park was still again, and Lisa Anderson was standing in a lot in pajama pants and bare feet and the phone she'd dropped was still lying in the gravel by her front door, screen cracked.

It rang.

The screen lit up. I could see it from my window — the bright rectangle on the grey gravel, buzzing, insistent. Terry calling back. Terry, an hour away in Fort Smith or broken down on the highway or already gone, calling his wife's phone because she'd been on the line with him when she screamed and the call dropped and he was trying to reach her and she was standing fifteen feet from the phone and she would never answer it again.

It rang four times. Then it stopped. Then it rang again.

I put the binoculars down because my hands were shaking and I couldn't hold them steady anymore, and I pressed my palms flat against my thighs and I breathed and I wanted — I wanted to go out there and answer it and tell him. Tell him what? What would I say? "Your wife is gone, she's standing right here but she's gone, and you should stop calling"? I couldn't go out there. I couldn't help. I couldn't even witness it properly because my hands wouldn't stop shaking, and I was angry — not at the Turned, not at the organism, but at the phone for ringing, at Terry for calling, at the smallness and uselessness of a phone call in a world that no longer had room for the thing phone calls are for, which is the belief that the person you're calling is still the person you're calling.

The phone stopped ringing. The screen went dark. Nobody picked it up.

The grin. The smoothing. The blank.

I would see it again. I would see it too many times. But the first time was the one that taught me what I was actually looking at, and what I was looking at was not a disease or a possession or a punishment. It was a recruitment. Something was inviting people in, and the invitation looked like a smile, and the cost of the invitation was everything you were.

Nobody touched her. Nobody bit her. Nobody scratched her or bled on her or breathed on her. They just scared her enough, and the fear did the rest. Every zombie movie I'd ever seen was wrong. The walls didn't matter. The locks didn't matter. The thing that got you wasn't on the other side of the door. It was inside your own body, waiting for the right chemical signal.

---

I closed the blinds.

I sat on the floor of the bathroom — the smallest room, no windows, the most enclosed space in the trailer — with my back against the tub and my knees pulled up and I breathed. I breathed the way I breathe when I'm trying not to cry, which is the same way I breathe when I'm trying to think, which says something about me that I'm not ready to analyze.

Here is what I knew: Pembrook was one of them. Lisa Anderson was one of them now too. She'd been fine until she wasn't, and the thing that changed her was running, screaming, being afraid. The Turned hadn't caught her. They'd *made* her afraid, and the fear itself was what changed her. The people who didn't panic — Ricky Sims drove out fast but he was angry-fast, not scared-fast, and he made it. Pembrook had been standing in his lot for a full day and nobody bothered him — because he was already one of them, but the principle was the same. Calm equaled safe. Panic equaled gone.

And here is the other thing I knew, the thing that sat heavier: they ate. They drank. They foraged through garbage and tore tomatoes off vines and drank from garden hoses. They were not dying. They were not winding down. They were maintaining themselves with the mechanical persistence of something that intended to still be here tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. Whatever this was, it wasn't a spasm. It wasn't a fever that would break. It was a new steady state, and the things outside my window were settling into it the way water settles into a basin — filling every available space, finding equilibrium, and staying.

You couldn't wait this out. The movie was over — the one where you barricade and hold and the National Guard shows up on Day Five with MREs and hazmat suits. That movie required the sick people to deteriorate. These weren't deteriorating. That movie required the walls to keep you safe. The walls were irrelevant when the mechanism was your own adrenaline. That movie required a cavalry. The cavalry was probably standing in a parking lot somewhere with blank faces, because the thing that turns you is the thing soldiers are trained to produce.

That was the thought I had on Day Two, sitting on a bathroom floor in a single-wide trailer, and it would turn out to be the most important thought I ever had, though I didn't know it yet and wouldn't fully understand why for weeks.

One data point on the fear mechanism. Multiple observations on the biology. You can't draw a conclusion from one data point. That's not science, that's a guess. But it was the start of a pattern that I would spend the next six weeks filling in, and filling in wrong, and filling in less wrong, over and over, the way you always learn things: by being wrong in progressively more useful ways.

I didn't go outside. I tried 911. I got a recording — "Due to an extremely high call volume, all operators are currently assisting other callers. Please remain on the line" — and I waited eight minutes and nobody came on. I hung up and tried again and waited eleven minutes and nobody came on. The dispatchers were either gone or triaging a crisis so far beyond one scared kid in a trailer park that my call was at the bottom of a list nobody was ever going to finish.

Outside, through the bathroom wall — you can hear everything through these walls, that's the thing about trailers, they don't keep secrets — I could hear footsteps on gravel. Slow, even, unhurried. Walking past my unit and then away and then back and then away. Patrolling. Not searching. Just... present. Maintaining coverage, the way units in a game maintain a zone of control. At one point the footsteps paused near my unit, and I heard a different sound — a metallic scraping, then a tearing, then chewing. One of them had found something to eat. It ate for about a minute, standing in the gravel three feet from my bathroom wall, and then moved on.

Somewhere past Route 22, in the direction of the subdivisions where the dogs used to bark, a single rifle shot. Then nothing.

I sat in the bathroom in the dark and I listened and I did not sleep and the trailer settled around me — the creaks and pops of a metal box cooling in the October night — and every sound was both familiar and alien, because this was my home and also it wasn't anymore, because home requires a person and the person wasn't here, and what was here instead was just a fifteen-year-old and some thin walls and the knowledge that the thin walls were the only thing between him and a thing that grinned when it was hungry and ate when it was done.
