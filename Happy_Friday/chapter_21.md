# Chapter 21: The Wolf Knife

Lake Fort Smith was a man-made lake at the bottom of the mountains — a dam, a spillway, a campground with bathrooms that still smelled like bleach and pine, and a gas station at the highway junction that had been looted for food but not for shopping carts. We took four. The wheels were stiff from sitting in the rain but they rolled, and rolling was the point: sixty miles of trail with packs on our backs had taught us the value of not carrying weight when you didn't have to.

The transition happened in an afternoon. We walked out of the forest and onto pavement and the difference was immediate — the shock of flat ground after two weeks of roots and rocks, the strange smoothness of asphalt under shoes that had molded to uneven terrain. Highway 71 stretched south toward Fayetteville, the old Pig Trail, two lanes of cracked blacktop winding through the mountains. It had been mostly abandoned since Highway 49 was built — the newer, wider road that bypassed the switchbacks and the small towns and the tourist traps that had once sold Ozark pottery and homemade fudge and wooden signs that said BLESS THIS MESS. The Pig Trail was a relic. Now it was our road.

Shopping carts on asphalt. The sound was absurd — that rattling, clattering grocery-store sound echoing off the mountain walls, announcing our presence to every Turned within a quarter mile. But the trade-off was worth it: packs in the carts, bodies upright, shoulders and hips finally unburdened after days of grinding. Ruth sat in her cart when her knees gave out, Maria pushing her, the two of them looking like the world's most unlikely grocery run.

The highway was a literal graveyard — cars sitting with their doors open, nobody coming back for them. A minivan in the left lane, both sliding doors wide, two car seats in the back, empty. A pickup nose-down in the drainage ditch, the cab half-submerged in standing water that had turned green. A Buick stopped diagonally across both lanes, driver's door open, keys still in the ignition, the battery long dead. The evidence of panic stops — people who pulled over, got out, and never got back in. Every open door was a sentence that ended mid-word.

We pushed the carts through the gaps. The wheels rattled over broken glass and around a suitcase that had split open on the shoulder, clothes scattered across the gravel — a woman's blouse, a pair of jeans, a child's sneaker with the laces still tied. A cell phone sat on the guardrail, screen cracked in a spiderweb pattern, placed there carefully by someone who had expected to come back for it. Nobody had come back.

The Turned were more numerous here. Closer to population centers, closer to the small towns strung along the highway like beads on a wire. We saw them among the cars — singles and pairs drifting through the lanes like shoppers in an abandoned lot. One sat in a driver's seat with both hands on the steering wheel, staring through the windshield, going nowhere. Another stood at a gas pump outside a Shell station, a credit card in her right hand, the ritual of fueling preserved without function. She swiped the card against the dead reader while we passed. Swiped it again. The motion was smooth, practiced, the muscle memory of a thousand fill-ups persisting after everything else had been taken.

We gave them wide berth, pushing the carts onto the shoulder, into the gravel, waiting for them to pass. The highway was exposed — no tree cover, no ridgelines to hide behind — but it was fast. Seven miles the first day. Eight the second. The flat ground and the cart wheels were doing what the trail couldn't.

On the second day we came around a curve and found the food truck.

It had jackknifed across both lanes — a converted box truck, faded red, the side panel reading UNCLE DEL'S SMOKEHOUSE in hand-painted letters that were peeling at the edges. The back doors had burst open on impact and the contents had scattered across the highway — paper plates, napkins, plastic forks, an industrial-sized jug of barbecue sauce that had shattered and left a dark stain on the asphalt like old blood. The food was gone. Whatever had been edible — the meat, the bread, the coleslaw in plastic tubs — had been consumed. By Turned, by animals, by time. What remained was packaging and bones.

The bones were in the ditch. Not scattered — concentrated, the way debris collects in an eddy. Skulls and femurs and ribcages, some still connected, most not. Picked clean. The Turned feed — I knew this from observation, from the journal, from six weeks of data. But seeing the evidence was different from knowing it, and the evidence was thorough. The bones were pale in the November light. Some had tooth marks.

Caleb asked what they were and Marcus said "deer" without hesitating and the lie was so smooth and so necessary that nobody corrected it.

We passed the food truck by climbing the embankment on the right side, hauling the carts up through the gravel and weeds, and coming back down on the other side. The Turned in the area — four of them, drifting among the wreckage — didn't follow. They stayed near the truck, near the bones, near the residual smell of what had once been food. The organism's caloric drive, operating at the most basic level. Stay near the food source. Wait.

That evening, at camp, Marcus got a response on the CB.

He'd been trying every night since the trail — sitting apart from the fire, the handheld CB from the church pressed to his ear, cycling through channels, listening to static. On the trail the mountains had blocked the signal. On the highway the terrain opened up, and seven miles south of Lake Fort Smith, with a clear line of sight down the valley toward Fayetteville, the static broke.

"— repeat, this is University of Arkansas research station, Dr. Moss speaking. If you are receiving this broadcast —"

Marcus keyed the mic. "Dr. Moss. This is Marcus. Group of eight, coming south on 71 from the OHT. Church group out of Clarksville."

The pause was three seconds. It felt longer.

"Clarksville. How far out are you?"

"Two days. Maybe three. We've got an elderly woman and a child. Moving slow."

"Are you armed?"

"Lightly. Crossbow. Hatchets."

Another pause. Then: "We have an emitter running. Eighty-meter radius. When you reach the campus, approach from the north — Razorback Road. The emitter covers the life sciences building and the surrounding quad. Stay calm, keep your heart rates down, and come straight to us. I'll have the door open."

Marcus looked at me across the fire. The CB crackled with static and the faint hum of the frequency — audible even through the tiny speaker, a sound I'd never heard but that Jim had dreamed about on Day 7. A tuning fork pressed against the bones of the earth.

"Copy," Marcus said. "We'll be there."

He told her about the journal. Brief, factual — the way Marcus told everything. A kid had been writing down observations since Day One. Behavioral patterns, conversion mechanics, survival data. Six weeks of primary source material. Moss asked him to repeat that. He did.

"Bring the journal," she said. "Bring everything."

The CB went to static. Marcus clipped it to his belt and came back to the fire and didn't say anything for a while. Then he said, "She sounds tired."

"She's been broadcasting for six weeks," I said.

"Yeah." He poked the fire. "But she's still broadcasting."

On Day 37 A part of me I loved died, it started from a hillside, with a plan I'd borrowed from Eskimo hunters.

The roadblock appeared on the afternoon of the second day on the highway. We came around a long curve where the road cut through a ridgeline — blasted limestone faces on the right, a steep drop on the left where the mountain fell away — and the highway ahead was blocked.

The National Guard had been here.

I recognized the setup from the kind of reading I used to do — Wikipedia deep dives, military logistics, the organizational patterns of emergency response. Jersey barriers across both lanes, the heavy concrete dividers that separate highway traffic, arranged in a staggered pattern that forced approaching vehicles to slow and weave. Concertina wire spiraling around the perimeter in thick coils, the razor-sharp kind, military grade, designed to entangle and cut. Two Humvees inside the compound — one upright with its doors open, the other on its side, the undercarriage facing the hillside like a dead animal exposing its belly. A command tent, collapsed, the olive-drab canvas pooled on the ground. A generator, silent, fuel cans scattered around it. Sandbag positions at the corners, the bags split and leaking sand that mixed with the gravel.

They'd set up a checkpoint to control refugee flow. The highway was the secondary route between Alma and Fayetteville — not the interstate, not the main evacuation corridor, but the road people would take when the interstate was gridlocked. The Guard had positioned here to screen, direct, manage the flow. Then the flow had overwhelmed them, or the organism had, and the checkpoint had become a monument.

Cars were backed up on both sides. The north approach — our side — had a line of vehicles stretching back maybe a quarter mile, stopped in both lanes, some with doors open, some with the windows smashed. People who had stopped in time. Behind them, the evidence of people who hadn't: a sedan rear-ended into the back of a pickup, the hood crumpled, airbags deployed and hanging like deflated lungs. A semi that had jackknifed trying to stop, its trailer slewed across the shoulder, the cab hanging over the edge of the drop on the left. The guardrail was twisted where the semi had gone partially through it — bent metal, bolts sheared, a fifty-foot drop beyond to the rocks and scrub below. The semi's trailer dangled, half on the road, half over nothing.

The south side was the same. More cars, more doors, more evidence. The roadblock had trapped traffic from both directions, creating a parking lot of abandoned vehicles with a military compound in the center and no way through.

And among the cars, around the compound, on both sides of the roadblock — the Turned.

I counted from the hillside through the binoculars. The north side: approximately fifty, milling among the backed-up cars, drifting between open doors, sitting on hoods, standing at the guardrail looking at nothing. The south side: approximately fifty more, the same aimless drift, the same patient gravitational circling. Inside the compound itself: maybe thirty, wandering among the Humvees and the collapsed tent and the sandbag positions, drawn to the military infrastructure the way they were drawn to all human-built things.

A hundred and thirty. Maybe more. Three groups separated by the jersey barriers and the wire, each below frenzy threshold, each drifting in its own orbit. The terrain funneled them: the steep hillside on the right made climbing impractical, especially with shopping carts. The fifty-foot drop on the left, with the twisted guardrail and the semi wreckage, made that side impassable. The roadblock controlled the only viable passage.

The alternative was backtracking — north two miles, then east on a forest service road to bypass the ridgeline, then south on a county road to rejoin the highway below the roadblock. But the forest service road was unpaved, rutted, impossible with shopping carts. We'd have to carry the packs again. And the detour added half a day of exposed walking through open terrain where we'd already seen Turned drifting in from the surrounding towns. Ruth's atenolol supply was at four days. Four days of medication between her and a heart rate that would light up the organism like a signal flare.

I studied the compound for an hour. I studied the wire. I studied the three groups and their separation and the jersey barriers that kept them apart and the funnel geometry of the terrain and the coils of unused concertina wire stacked behind one of the Humvees — still bundled, never deployed, the military's surplus, left behind when the checkpoint fell.

The idea didn't arrive unwanted this time.

I'd read about it years ago, The Eskimo wolf knife. You take a knife blade, coat it in seal fat, freeze it upright in the snow. A wolf finds it, licks the fat. The blade cuts the wolf's tongue. The wolf tastes its own blood. The blood triggers a feeding response — the wolf can't stop licking. Each lick cuts deeper. The wolf bleeds to death from licking its own blood off the blade that's killing it.

The razor wire was the knife. The frenzy was the wolf.

I should say I didn't want it. That's what the journal should record — the reluctance, the moral weight, the boy who didn't want to become the kind of person who engineers a slaughter. And that boy existed. He was in there somewhere, behind the anger, behind the weeks of trail and the parking lot and the smile.

But the truth is more complicated than the boy.

Part of me had been waiting for this. The anger — the thing with edges that I'd carried since Clarksville, that had fueled every uphill, that had turned physical pain into something I used instead of something I endured — the anger had been looking for a target it could actually reach. Not the organism, which was everywhere and nowhere. Not myself, whose self-inflicted suffering on the trail was satisfying but pointless. The anger wanted something it could *do.* A way to punish the thing that had taken my mother, even if the punishment landed on the bodies the thing was wearing.  I would not yet know the cost.

The roadblock was the first opportunity I'd had to hurt it.

The analytical brain provided the method — the wire, the density mechanics, the frenzy threshold, the wolf knife principle. The math checked. But the eagerness was new. The eagerness came from the thing with edges, and it said: *yes. Finally. Make it hurt.*

I want it recorded that this frightened me. The math and the rage arrived at the same answer, and I couldn't tell which one I was listening to.
---

I proposed it to the group on the hillside, in the flat analytical voice I default to when what I'm saying is too large for inflection.

"There's an Eskimo hunting technique for wolves. You coat a knife in seal fat, freeze it in the snow. The wolf licks the fat, cuts its tongue, tastes blood, can't stop. Bleeds to death licking its own blood off the blade." I let that sit for a moment. "The razor wire is the knife. The frenzy is the wolf."

Silence. People hearing something they wished they hadn't.

"Three of us go in quiet. Me, Marcus, Dale. We unspool the extra wire inside the compound — there are unused coils behind the Humvee. Make the web denser. Then we open both gates — the north and south barriers. Create funnels. Then we find a car with a working battery in the traffic backup, start the stereo, blast music. Maximum draw. All three groups converge on the compound. A hundred and thirty Turned in a web of razor wire. The density hits threshold. They frenzy. The wire does the rest."

More silence. Nobody was prepared to hear this from a fifteen-year-old.

Jim spoke first. "Those are people, Nate."

"They were people." The sentence came out and I heard it cross a line. The detachment in my voice. The way I said "were" without flinching. I wanted to flinch. I couldn't afford to.

"They're still people," Jim said. "Somewhere in there, they're still —"

"Jim, I know. I know they have memories. I know the organism uses those memories. I know that somewhere inside each of them is a person who had a name and a family and a life. I know all of this. And I also know that between us and Fayetteville there are a hundred and thirty of them blocking the highway, and Ruth has four days of atenolol, and we can't carry the packs on an unpaved detour, and we don't have half a day to go around."

"There's always another way."

"There isn't always another way. Sometimes the other way is worse and the only honest thing to do is say so."

The argument expanded. Sienna opposed it on instinct. "It feels wrong. It feels like — Nate, you're talking about setting a trap. You're talking about using their own bodies against them."

"I'm talking about using the frenzy's own destructive behavior in a controlled context. The frenzy happens without us — it's happened at the Lyles', at the ranch house, at every concentration point I've observed. We're not creating a new threat. We're directing an existing one."

"That's a rationalization."

"Maybe. But it's also true."

Marcus, from his position at the edge of the group: "The detour adds half a day. Half a day carrying packs on unpaved roads with no cover. Ruth can't do it — not with four days of medication left."

Dale spoke. He was holding the fox carving — finished now, the detail work clean, the strokes precise with steady hands. "When I was using," he said, "my counselor told me that recovery means choosing the hard thing that works over the easy thing that feels right. This is the hard thing."

The group looked at him. Dale — weeks past withdrawal, hands steady, standing straighter than he had since Clarksville — had reframed the moral question with the vocabulary of a man who'd spent a decade learning to distinguish between what felt right and what was right. In recovery, the thing that feels right is the relapse. The hard thing — the meeting, the daily grind of choosing not to use — is the thing that works.

"This is the meeting," Dale said. "This is the part where you sit in the folding chair and you don't want to be there and you do the thing anyway because the alternative is worse."

Jim looked at Dale. Something passed between them — the pastor and the addict, two men who had spent their lives in folding chairs in basements, arriving at the same place from opposite directions.

"I won't be part of it," Jim said. Quiet. Certain. "I'll stay back with Ruth and Caleb. I'll pray."

"For us?" I asked.

"For them." He meant the Turned. He meant the hundred and thirty people at the roadblock who were about to die because a fifteen-year-old with a notebook had borrowed a wolf-hunting technique. "You do what you need to do, Nate. I'll do what I need to do. And if we're both right, God can sort out the difference."

Sienna would not or could not look at me.

---

We went in before dawn.

Marcus, Dale, and I slipped down the hillside in the dark, moving slow, breathing slow, threading between the backed-up cars on the north approach. The Turned on our side — fifty of them, scattered among the vehicles — were in drift mode, the aimless, passive circling that passed for rest. We moved through them the way we'd learned on the trail: no sudden movements, no eye contact, pulse steady, the body language of furniture. A Turned man stood three feet from me between a Honda and a Dodge, his head tilted, his eyes tracking nothing. I passed him close enough to smell him — the organism smell, the sweet rot, the biological wrongness — and he didn't register me. I was below his threshold. I was background noise.

The compound entrance was a gap in the jersey barriers on the north side, narrowed by concertina wire that the Guard had strung across the opening. Marcus held the wire up with a piece of two-by-four scavenged from the roadside while Dale and I crawled under. The razor edges caught my jacket, sliced the fabric, nicked the skin beneath. A thin line of blood on my forearm. The pain was familiar — the earned kind, the kind I'd been seeking since Clarksville. I didn't flinch.

Inside the compound, the thirty resident Turned drifted among the military wreckage. A woman in civilian clothes sitting on a sandbag. A man in National Guard fatigues — ACU pattern, the name tape too dark to read — standing at the generator, his hand on the pull-start, yanking it at intervals. The generator was out of fuel. The motion continued. Yank. Wait. Yank. Wait. The muscle memory of a soldier who had been told to keep the generator running and whose body was still following the last order it received.

We found the spare wire behind the overturned Humvee. Four coils of military concertina — the serious kind, the wire with the razor blades stamped into it at two-inch intervals, designed to entangle and lacerate anything that touched it. Each coil was heavy, sixty pounds of steel, compressed into a cylinder that expanded when you cut the binding straps. We cut the straps on two of them and the wire sprang outward in a controlled chaos of razor edges.

Unspooling concertina wire in the dark, quietly, among Turned, is not something I can describe without the word "careful" becoming inadequate. Dale held the expanding coil with leather gloves we'd found in the Humvee — military issue, thick, designed for exactly this work — while Marcus and I stretched the wire across the gaps between the barriers, between the Humvees, across the open ground inside the compound. The wire sang when it moved — a low, metallic hum, the kind of sound that carries. Every time it sang I stopped breathing and watched the nearest Turned for a reaction. No reaction. The sound was below their attention threshold, or close enough to the wind-in-the-wire sounds they'd been hearing for weeks that it didn't register as novel.

The wire cut us anyway. Through the gloves, through the jacket sleeves, through the careful spacing of hands that knew where the blades were. My palms bled. Dale's forearms bled. Marcus had a gash across the back of his right hand that he wrapped with a strip of his shirt without stopping. The pain was a tax. The blood was the cost of the plan. I noticed — the analytical brain noticed — that my hands were bleeding on the same wire that was about to kill a hundred and thirty people, and the symmetry of that was the kind of thing I would have written in the journal if I'd had the journal with me instead of a coil of razor wire.

We opened the gates. North side first — pulling the jersey barriers apart just enough to create a funnel, an invitation, a doorway that said *come in.* Then the south side, same thing. Two funnels. Two open mouths. The wolf knife, set in the snow.

The car took three tries. The first — a Camry in the backed-up traffic — was dead. The second — a Ford F-150 — was dead. The third — a Chevy Malibu, pushed sideways on the shoulder, the driver's door hanging open — turned over when Marcus hit the key. Not the engine — the engine was dry — but the electronics lit up. The dashboard glowed. The stereo came on.

Static. Marcus hit the CD button. A disc was still in the player.

Lynyrd Skynyrd. "Free Bird." The opening notes — the quiet ones, the piano and the guitar, the soft part before the song becomes what it becomes — filled the Malibu and spilled out through the open door and echoed off the limestone walls of the highway cut and carried, carried, carried into the November morning like a signal flare made of sound.

We ran.

Back through the wire — faster now, less careful, the razor edges catching and cutting and not mattering because the clock was running. Up the hillside, scrambling through scrub oak and dead leaves, Dale's breathing the recovery count — *in two three four, out two three four* — Marcus behind us with the crossbow up, watching the compound below. We reached the observation point — two hundred yards south, above the roadblock, the same hillside where the group was waiting — and I pulled up the binoculars and watched.

The Turned responded. The fifty on the north side oriented first — heads turning, bodies shifting, the collective attention rotating toward the sound like a field of sunflowers tracking the sun. They began to move. Not fast — the aimless drift accelerating into purposeful walking, still individual, still below threshold, but converging. Through the backed-up cars, around the open doors, toward the funnel we'd made in the north barrier. On the south side, the same: fifty more, turning, drifting, drawn by the music that was now loud enough to hear from the hillside — the guitar solo building, the drums coming in, the song becoming the anthem it was written to be, played for an audience of the dead.

The north group reached the funnel first. They filtered through the gap in the barriers — one at a time, then two, then a press of bodies, the funnel doing what funnels do, compressing the flow, accelerating it. Inside the compound, the resident thirty were already agitated — the music was loudest here, bouncing off the jersey barriers and the Humvees, and the incoming bodies were adding density, adding the proximity signals that the organism read as *converge, converge, converge.* The south group hit the south funnel seconds later. More bodies. More density. The compound was filling.

I counted. Sixty. Eighty. A hundred. The three groups were becoming one group, and the one group was compressed into a space designed to hold a military checkpoint, not a hundred human bodies, and the wire — our wire, the new web we'd strung in the dark — was everywhere, chest-high, knee-high, strung between the barriers in a geometry of edges.

The behavior changed. The twitchiness first — the restless, jerky movements I'd catalogued at the Lyles' and at every concentration point since. Heads snapping toward nothing. Hands opening and closing. The droning started. Low, resonant, building — a hundred human vocal cords producing a sound that was not speech and not song and not anything that had a name, a harmonic that built on itself, each voice amplifying the others, the acoustic signature of the threshold approaching.

"Free Bird" was still playing. The solo — the long, climbing, desperate solo that had filled a thousand arenas and a million car radios — was competing with the drone, and losing.

"It's happening," I said.

Dale was beside me. His hands were steady. His breathing was the recovery count. He was watching and his face was the face of a man who understood craving in all its forms and was choosing, again, the hard thing.

The shudder. The phase transition. One moment they were milling, individual, restless. The next they were a single thing — a collective body, convulsing, the coordinated patience of the herd snapping into the undirected violence of the frenzy. The sound changed: not the drone but a roar, multi-throated, the sound of a hundred human vocal cords producing something that was not a human sound.  The sound of vocal chords being shredded from pressure and rage.

They hit the wire.

Not because they were aiming — because the wire was what was there. The nearest strand took the first impact: bodies pressing into razor edges, the concertina biting into arms and torsos and faces with the mechanical indifference of engineered steel. The wire held — it was military concertina, designed to stop infantry, designed to entangle and lacerate, and it did both. Every movement drove the blades deeper. Arms tangled in the coils, legs wrapped in the lower strands, bodies pressing forward into the web because the frenzy said *move* and the wire said *stop* and the frenzy was stronger than pain.

The wolf knife.

They cut themselves open on the wire. The blades opened skin and muscle and the blood came — not in drops but in sheets, running down the razor edges, pooling on the asphalt, the smell of it rising in the November air. The blood made the wire slick. The slickness let them push deeper. The deeper they pushed, the more the blades cut, and the cutting produced more blood and the blood produced more frenzy and the frenzy produced more pressure and the pressure drove them harder into the wire. The self-destruction spiral. The soft hands of humans grabbing at cold spirals of razor blades, sliced fingers falling before them, then those same fingerless people were biting those same razors.  The wolf licking the blade. Unable to stop because the thing that was killing it was the thing it craved.

The guardrail went next. The left side of the roadblock — the fifty-foot drop, the twisted metal where the semi had already punched through — was the weakest point. The frenzied mass, a hundred bodies pressing and shoving and tearing with no direction and no purpose, crowded toward the edge. The guardrail, already bent, already sheared at the bolts, held for maybe thirty seconds. Then it folded outward like a gate and the bodies behind it didn't stop — couldn't stop, because the frenzy doesn't understand edges, doesn't understand gravity, doesn't understand that the ground disappears — and they went over. Dozens of them. Pushed by the crush behind them, carried by the momentum of a hundred bodies that had nowhere else to go. The sound of them hitting the rocks fifty feet below was — I heard it like a drum cadence for a song turned obscene. I will not describe it.

The compound was a slaughterhouse. The road surface was covered in blood — not splashes, not splatters, but a continuous layer, inches deep in the low spots where the asphalt dipped, pooling against the jersey barriers, running in dark rivulets into the drainage ditches on either side. Viscera hung from the razor wire — intestines caught on the blades, loops of tissue strung between the coils like grotesque garlands, the things inside people that are supposed to stay inside. The smell reached us on the hillside, two hundred yards away: blood and meat and shit, the smell of a body opened, multiplied by a hundred, compressed into a quarter-mile of highway. Maria turned away. Caleb was already on Marcus's back, face buried.

I watched through the binoculars. The analytical brain was recording. The rage was watching too, and for once, the rage was satisfied, the satisfaction frightened me more than the dying.

Then the others came.

I hadn't counted them because I hadn't seen them. They came from the woods on both sides — from the hillsides, from the hollows, from the county roads and forest service roads and the small towns scattered through the mountains between Alma and Fayetteville. People who had been fleeing on this secondary route when the organism caught them. People who had turned on the highway and wandered into the trees. People who had been drifting for weeks through the Ozark woods, alone or in pairs, drawn by nothing, going nowhere, until the sound of a hundred frenzied voices gave them somewhere to go.

They came in tens, then twenties. Through the tree line on the right. Up the embankment from the drop on the left — climbing, somehow, the ones who could still climb. From the backed-up cars on both approaches, emerging from vehicles I'd counted as empty. The count I'd done from the hillside — a hundred and thirty — had been the visible population. The actual population was the visible plus the invisible, the ones in the woods, the ones in the hollows, the ones I hadn't seen because I hadn't looked hard enough or far enough or with enough respect for the possibility that I was wrong.

The hundred and thirty became two hundred. Then three hundred. The compound couldn't hold them — the frenzy spilled out through the funnels we'd opened, but more kept coming, and the wire was everywhere, and the new arrivals hit the wire and the wire cut them and the blood and the frenzy and the wire did what the wolf knife does. The killing field expanded beyond the compound, into the backed-up cars on both sides, the frenzy radiating outward as the density wave propagated, catching new arrivals in the same self-destruction spiral.

I lowered the binoculars.

I glanced at Sienna.

She was already looking at me. Not the way she'd looked at me on the trail — the sidelong glances, the concern, the trying-to-read-him focus of a girl who cared about someone she couldn't quite reach. This was different. Her eyes were wide and wet and her mouth was open slightly and the expression on her face was one I will carry longer than the woman in the wire or the sound of bodies on rocks or anything else that happened on that hillside.

Horror. And shame. Not her shame — mine. She was looking at me the way you look at something you helped build and then watched become monstrous. She had argued against it and lost and stayed and watched because she wouldn't leave, and now she was seeing what the plan meant and what I meant — the fifteen-year-old who had borrowed a wolf-hunting technique and applied it to three hundred human beings and watched it work and felt something that was not horror.

She saw me notice. She turned away. Fast, deliberate, the way you turn from a car accident you've already seen too much of. She wiped her face with the back of her hand — quick, angry, the tears dealt with like an inconvenience — and she did not look at me again.

Something broke.

Not the analytical machinery — that had broken before. This was the thing underneath, the thing the machinery was built to protect: the fifteen-year-old boy from a trailer park who said "Happy Friday, bud" and meant it. That thing looked at Sienna's face and saw what it had become in her eyes and the seeing was the breaking.

The sound that came out of me was not a word. Something lower, something animal — the sound a body makes when the thing holding it together lets go all at once. Then it was crying. Sobbing. The kind that takes your legs because the diaphragm is convulsing too hard to keep the rest of you upright. I went down — not falling, crumbling, the way a building comes apart when the supports give, first to my knees, then forward onto my hands, and I was on the ground on a hillside in Arkansas making sounds like a wounded thing a few hundred yards from an enraged beast that continued to thrash itself to death, because that's what I was.

Dale reached for me. His hand — steady, always steady now, the hand that had held the wire and carved the fox and gripped my shoulder through every hard thing since Clarksville — reached for my arm.

I flinched away. Hard, involuntary, the recoil of something that couldn't be touched. Not because Dale was wrong but because touch meant comfort and comfort meant I was still human and I didn't know if I was still human and not-knowing was the thing that was making the sounds come out of me.

I looked at Dale. His face was — I saw it, the machinery records even when the rest of me is broken — the face of a man who recognized what he was seeing because he'd been there, on the floor, making the same sounds for different reasons. Recognition was worse than pity. Recognition meant he knew.

I ran.

I ran like a child runs — blind, graceless, crashing through the scrub oak and the dead leaves and the November brush on the hillside, away from the compound and the wire and the blood and the sounds and Sienna's face and Dale's hand and everything I had done and everything I had become. I ran into the woods because the woods were the only place that wasn't the roadblock and I needed to not be at the roadblock. The branches caught my face, my arms, the cuts from the wire opening again, and I didn't care. I ran until my legs gave out and then I crawled and when I couldn't crawl I stopped and I was somewhere in the Ozark woods, on the ground, alone, and the sounds were still coming out of me and I couldn't make them stop.

---

Sienna found me.

I don't know how long it took — minutes, an hour, the time was broken along with everything else. I heard her before I saw her — the careful footsteps, the brush moving, the sound of someone tracking something through woods they didn't know. She was fast. She'd always been fast. The athlete's instinct for pursuit, repurposed.

She didn't say anything. She sat down on the ground next to me — the cold ground, the dead leaves, the November dirt — and she didn't touch me and she didn't speak and she didn't try to fix it. She just sat. The way Dale had sat with me after dinner on other nights. The way you sit with something that is broken and that you can't repair and that you refuse to leave.

I don't know what happened in those hours. I know the sounds stopped eventually. I know the light changed — the afternoon moving toward evening, the shadows lengthening, the temperature dropping. I know she stayed. I know that at some point my breathing slowed and the convulsions stopped and I was just lying on the ground in the woods with my face in the leaves and my hands bleeding and the girl who had looked at me with horror sitting beside me in silence, and the silence was not the silence of judgment. It was the silence of someone who had decided that being there was enough, even if being there meant sitting next to the thing she'd seen on the hillside.

That is all I will ever say about this.  What happened is not for a journal or a story to be told, there was no lesson to learn. Those hours belong to nobody, I wish I could forget them myself.

We walked back at dusk. I don't remember the walk. I remember her hand on my elbow — once, brief, guiding me around a root — and I remember the group's faces when we emerged from the tree line. Marcus's face. Dale's face. Jim's face. I did not look at any of them. I could not look at anyone. The machinery was not running. The analytical brain was offline. Whatever remained was something older and simpler — a body that could walk and a pair of eyes that could see and a mouth that would not open.

I did not speak. Not that evening, not that night. They built a fire and I sat apart from it. Someone brought me water and I didn't drink it. Someone brought me food and I didn't eat it. Caleb brought me the wooden beagle and put it in my lap and went back to Marcus without a word and the beagle sat there on my thigh, small and wooden and carved by steady hands, and I did not pick it up and I did not put it down.

They let me be. There was nothing else to do.

---

The next morning I was functional. Not repaired — functional. The machinery had restarted in the night, the way a generator restarts when the fuel line clears. I ate. I drank. I packed. I walked.

Nobody mentioned it. Nobody asked. The silence around what had happened on the hillside was complete and permanent — a thing witnessed that did not need words because the words would have been smaller than the thing. Sienna walked near me but not beside me. She did not bring it up. She would never bring it up. We would never talk about it.

Some things survive by being buried. This was one of them.

The group walked south through a scene from hell.

Nobody spoke.

The road was covered in blood. The asphalt was submerged under a dark, thickening layer that soaked through our shoes in the first step and didn't stop. I felt the warmth of it through my soles, through my socks — a wet, heavy warmth that was nothing like water or mud. It was only what it was. The shopping cart wheels cut tracks through it, thin lines of exposed asphalt that filled in behind us.

Viscera hung from the razor wire at head height. Intestines draped across the concertina coils, loops of tissue caught on the blades, stretched by gravity into shapes that the body was never meant to make outside of it. Strips of skin. Muscle. Things that didn't have names outside a medical textbook and that I was seeing in the open air, in the morning light, strung on military wire like offerings. The smell was the smell of the compound compressed into a space we were now walking through — blood and meat and shit and something else, something biological, the chemical signature of hundreds of bodies opened at once, a smell that coated the inside of the throat and stayed there.

Maria vomited into the drainage ditch. Dale's face was white but his hands were steady, and he put one of those steady hands on Maria's back and held her hair and waited.

I saw her near the south funnel. A Turned woman, caught in the wire. Still alive. No longer frenzied — the frenzy had passed, the density had dropped below threshold, the phase transition had reversed. She was just there. Tangled in the concertina at the waist and the arms, the razor blades embedded in her clothes and her skin, dozens of points of entry. She was bleeding — slowly now, the frenzy's violence spent, the cuts seeping instead of flowing. She looked at nothing. The organism was still running behind her eyes but the body it was running was too damaged to move. She breathed. The breathing was the only motion. The wire rose and fell with her chest, the blades shifting in the wounds with each breath, and she didn't react to the cutting because the organism didn't process pain the way a person would.

I passed her. I didn't look away. I looked at her the way I looked at everything: directly, completely, recording. Someone's wife. Someone's mother. Someone who had been a person before the organism made her part of a collective, and who was now tangled in razor wire because a fifteen-year-old had borrowed a hunting technique from people who lived in a place where wolves were the problem.

Caleb was on Marcus's back, face buried in Marcus's shoulder. Marcus was talking to him — a low, steady murmur about nothing, about truck stops, about what kind of ice cream was best, keeping the boy's world small and warm while he picked the path through the wire and the blood, keeping Caleb's face turned away from the worst of it, which was all of it.

Jim walked last. He walked through the blood with his head bowed and his lips moving and he was praying — for the dead, for the Turned, for the people who had been people before they were meat on wire. I watched him and I understood that Jim's prayer and my math had arrived at the same event from different directions, and that the event was the same regardless of which road you took to get there, and that the difference between us was not in the outcome but in what we carried afterward.

Jim would carry the prayer. I would carry the woman in the wire.

That night, camped in a pulloff a mile south of the roadblock, I wrote by flashlight. The fire was too far from where I was sitting and I was sitting apart because I didn't want to be near people and I didn't want to be alone and...damn. I'd washed the blood off my shoes in a creek but the smell was still there — in my clothes, in my hair, in the skin of my hands where the wire had cut me. The cuts on my palms were shallow but they stung and I didn't bandage them because the stinging felt correct.

This was the first thing I'd written since the hillside. The machinery had been offline for most of a day — the breakdown, the woods, the silence, the walk through the blood. Now it was back, and the first thing the machinery did with its restored capacity was try to process what had happened by writing it down, because that's what the machinery does, because I am the machinery and the machinery is me and the writing is the only tool I have that works on the things that break me.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #15:**

*We killed approximately three hundred people yesterday. I say "approximately" because I lost count when the second wave came out of the woods. I say "people" because I don't know what else to call them. I say "we" because it was my idea.*

*I planned for a hundred and thirty. I planned it with math and with a hunting technique I'd read about on Wikipedia at two in the morning three years ago when I should have been sleeping. The Eskimo wolf knife. I taught myself how Eskimo hunters kill wolves and I applied it to human beings and the application worked and then kept working after I wanted it to stop.

*After the second wave I looked at Sienna and she was looking at me and the thing in her face was — I am not going to write what it was. I know what it was.

*I broke. I should record that. The analytical machinery failed and what came out was not data. Sienna came after me and we sat in the dirt for hours and that is all you need to know.

*Jim wouldn't look at me during dinner. Marcus gave me a cup of water and said "drink this" the way you talk to someone in shock, because I was.*

*Here is what I know: we are all alive, including Caleb, including Ruth, and we are one day closer to the university.*

*Here is what I don't know: whether that math justifies what we did.*

*Here is what I'm afraid of: that I'll get used to it.*

*Here is what I'm more afraid of: that I need to.* because clearly, I can't.

*Here is what I can't write and am writing anyway: part of me wanted it. The other thing. The thing with edges that I've been carrying since Clarksville. It wanted the roadblock. It wanted the wire to hold and the frenzy to build and the organism to feel, for once, what it felt like to be on the receiving end. The math provided the justification. The anger provided the willingness. And I don't know which one made the decision because they arrived at the same answer at the same time and the answer was: do it.*

*I told Jim "they were people" and heard the detachment in my own voice and the detachment was real but it was also a performance — the analytical boy performing analysis while the angry boy watched the wire cut and felt something that was not horror. And then the performance collapsed and I was on the ground making sounds that were not analysis.

*The worst part is the scale. I did the math for a hundred and thirty and the world sent three hundred and the wolf knife doesn't have an off switch. I can't hide behind precision when the result was the opposite of precise. I can't say "I calculated the optimal outcome" when the outcome was a quarter-mile of highway covered in blood deep enough to soak through shoes. The math was a frame I built and the world broke the frame and the breaking is the thing I can't reconcile: that my best analysis, my most careful plan, produced something I couldn't control.*

*Dale sat with me for an hour after dinner. He didn't say anything. He carved the fox. His hands were steady — the withdrawal broken days ago on the trail — and the fox was beautiful and I thought about how the damage and the craft come from the same place and you don't get one without the other. Dale's hands had shaken for days and now they didn't and the fox was proof that the other side of suffering is precision.*

*Tomorrow we walk. The highway stretches south toward Fayetteville — twenty miles, maybe twenty-five. More Turned as we get closer to the city. More decisions. I'll have a plan because that's what I do now. I make plans that involve other people dying so that my people can live, and I write them in a notebook and I execute them from hillsides and I carry the results in my chest like stones and the stones are getting heavier and I'm fifteen and I don't know how many more I can carry before the weight of them changes me into something I don't recognize.*

*Sienna asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said "Liar." She was right. She's always right about the things I don't say.*

The next day we found the town.

It wasn't much — a bend in the highway where a gas station, a general store, and a barbecue restaurant clustered around an intersection like survivors huddling for warmth. The kind of place that had survived on Pig Trail tourists: bikers on weekend rides, families stopping for pulled pork and sweet tea, college kids from Fayetteville driving up to see the fall leaves. A sign out front of the restaurant said WORLD FAMOUS SMOKED RIBS. The world that had made them famous was gone.

Someone had fortified the gas station. Plywood over the windows, reinforced with sheet metal from the restaurant's roof. A pickup truck parked sideways across the entrance, blocking the lot. Barbed wire — actual barbed wire, probably from a farm supply — strung between the gas pumps. And on the roof, behind a low wall of sandbags, a man with a deer rifle watching us approach.

"That's far enough," he called. We were fifty yards out. The shopping carts rattled to a stop.

Marcus raised both hands. "We're passing through. Heading south."

"Nobody passes through. You go around."

"There's no around. The highway is the road."

A pause. The man on the roof consulted someone below — I could hear voices, muffled, the acoustics of people arguing inside a metal-and-plywood box. Then a woman emerged from behind the truck barricade. Mid-forties, sunburned, a shotgun held at port arms with the casual competence of someone who'd grown up with guns.

"How many?" she asked.

"Eight. One child, one elderly."

She looked at us — really looked, the way you assess livestock or weather. Counting heads, reading posture, calculating threat. Her eyes lingered on Marcus's crossbow, on the hatchets at Dale's and Sienna's hips.

"You're armed."

"Lightly. We're not looking for trouble."

"Nobody's looking for trouble. Trouble shows up anyway." She lowered the shotgun half an inch. "What do you have to trade?"

This was Marcus's territory — the negotiation, the reading of a room. He stepped forward, slow, hands visible. "Medication. Blood pressure meds, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories. Some painkillers — prescription, from a pharmacy."

Interest flickered across her face. Medication was currency now — more valuable than food, more valuable than ammunition, because you couldn't grow it or reload it or find it in the woods. When the pharmacies were empty, the medication was gone.

"What do you want?"

"Food. Canned goods, dried meat, whatever you can spare. We're three days from Fayetteville."

They let us approach. Not inside — we traded through the barricade, items passed over the hood of the pickup truck. Maria handled the inventory, counting pills, portioning carefully, keeping enough of Ruth's atenolol for the remaining days while trading the surplus antibiotics and ibuprofen she'd stockpiled from the church's first-aid supplies. In exchange: twelve cans of beans, a bag of rice, a sleeve of beef jerky, and a gallon jug of water.

There were nine of them inside the gas station. I could see them through the gap in the plywood — faces in the dim interior, watching us the way the Turned watched from a distance, with that guarded, calculating patience. A teenager, roughly my age, stared at me from behind the counter. He had the look — the hollowed-out, too-old look that I recognized because I saw it in every reflective surface. We were the same age and we were both ancient.

I recognized the pattern. The Lyles' house. The fortified position, the barricade, the perimeter defense. The belief that if you built the walls high enough, the world would stay outside.

"How long have you been here?" I asked the woman.

"Since the beginning. Three weeks."

"How many were you when you started?"

She didn't answer, which was its own answer. More than nine. Maybe fifteen, maybe twenty. The attrition of a static position — the Turned pressing in, the supplies dwindling, the perimeter shrinking.

"You should move," I said. The words came out before the social calculus could stop them. "South. Fayetteville. We've heard there's a research group at the university — someone working on the frequency."

"We've heard a lot of things."

"The static defense doesn't hold. I've seen it. The Turned concentrate around fixed positions — the noise, the lights, the human smell. The longer you stay, the more of them gather. The density builds until it tips into frenzy and the frenzy destroys whatever you've built."

The woman looked at me. The way adults look at children who say things children shouldn't know. "How old are you?"

"Fifteen."

"And you're an expert on survival strategy."

"I'm an expert on what I've observed. And I've observed that everyone who fortifies dies. Everyone who moves survives. The math isn't complicated."

She didn't respond. Behind her, through the gap in the plywood, the teenager was still watching me. He'd heard. Whether he believed was a different question.

We left. Shopping carts loaded with the traded food, wheels rattling on the asphalt, the gas station shrinking behind us. Marcus walked beside me.

"You tried," he said.

"They won't move."

"No."

"They'll die there."

"Probably." Marcus adjusted the crossbow on his shoulder. "You can't save people who don't want to be saved. That's not a failure. That's a boundary."

A quarter mile past the gas station, a farmhouse sat back from the highway behind a collapsing fence. The house was empty — door open, curtains moving in the wind. But behind it, in a tilted coop with chicken wire peeling off the frame, something was alive and making sounds about it.

Three hens. Brown, fat, furious. Surviving on gravel and weeds and whatever insects had the misfortune of crossing their path. They'd outlasted the apocalypse through the only strategy chickens know: being too dumb and too angry to die.

Caleb heard them before anyone else. His head came up from Marcus's shoulder — he'd been riding in the cart, legs dangling — and his face did something I hadn't seen since before the roadblock. Hope. The specific, dangerous hope of a seven-year-old who has lost something and is seeing it returned in a different shape.

"Can we —"

"No," Marcus said.

"They'll die here."

"They've been alive for six weeks without us."

Maria was already lining a shopping cart with a towel. She looked at Marcus. Marcus looked at the sky. The hens went into the cart. They did not go quietly. They went with the concentrated outrage of animals being handled by strangers, flapping and squawking and producing a volume of sound wildly disproportionate to their size.

"If that bird makes one sound past dark," Marcus said, "it's nuggets."

Caleb, from the cart, deadly serious: "Her name is Steggy Two."

The chickens squawked at every crack in the asphalt, every pebble, every shift in the cart's trajectory. They squawked at the wind. They squawked at each other. They squawked at the concept of forward motion. We pushed them south toward Fayetteville in a shopping cart, three furious hens and a seven-year-old boy who was already talking to them in the low, earnest voice he used for Dale's wooden animals, and for thirty minutes the apocalypse was a grocery run that had gone sideways, and I almost forgot what the highway behind us looked like.

I looked back once. The man on the roof was watching us go. The rifle was still in his hands. The barbed wire glinted in the afternoon sun. Nine people in a gas station, waiting for the world to come to them.

The world would come.
