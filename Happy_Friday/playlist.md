# THE PLAYLIST
### Nate Carver's Field Notes

---

## Day 1 (Friday night)

No entries. I was playing Civ. The world was ending.

---

## Day 2 (Saturday)

**0942** — Mom not home. Phone to voicemail. Johnson Regional automated message: "unprecedented volume of patients."

**~1000** — Pembrook standing in lot. Open bathrobe. No movement since at least last night. Spigot left dripping. Garbage sorted from top (not raccoons — raccoons shred).
- ~~**Conclusion:** Pembrook is sick. Some kind of fugue state. Probably related to whatever is overwhelming the hospital.~~

**~1030** — Two strangers near laundry building. Same posture. Hands at sides. Three total, spaced across the park. All three face east — toward sun. Over the next hour they rotate as the sun moves. Collective. Like sunflowers on a time-lapse.
- ~~**Conclusion:** Mass illness? Neurological? Something that causes catatonia.~~
- **Conclusion:** Don't know what this is. Not catatonia — they're responsive, just selective about what they respond to. The sun-tracking is coordinated. Seems important.

**~1100** — Pembrook goes to spigot. Drinks ~15 seconds. Returns to position. Mechanical. No self-consciousness.

**~1130** — Stranger eats from Garcias' garden. Tomatoes, peppers, green and ripe, doesn't matter. ~4 minutes. Returns to position.

**~1200** — Pembrook sorts communal garbage. Eats something. Discards rest. Returns to position.
- ~~**Conclusion:** They're deteriorating. Confused. Foraging like homeless people. Probably a few days from collapse.~~
- **Conclusion:** They eat. They drink. They maintain themselves. A thing that eats is a thing that plans to keep going. **You cannot wait this out.**

**Pembrook skin:** Dull greenish-grey discoloration. Face and forearms — sun-exposed areas only. Not bruising. Not sunburn.
- **Conclusion:** Don't know what this means.

**~0800** — Ricky Sims starts truck. All three orient toward sound simultaneously. Heads swivel in unison. Begin walking toward truck ~2 mph. Ricky peels out, makes Highway 21. They don't pursue the fast-moving target. Return to positions after ~1 minute.
- When engine roared, Pembrook's face changed. A grin — too wide, too many teeth. Lasted ~5 seconds. Faded to blank.
- ~~**Conclusion:** Sound-attracted, slow-moving. Classic zombie rules — outrun them, barricade, wait for rescue.~~

### Anderson Incident (~1000)

Lisa Anderson came outside. On phone. Upset, loud. Three Turned approached from different directions. **Geometry** — cut off three exit routes before she noticed. Pembrook grinned. Lisa screamed. Ran.

- Running + screaming → more Turned converging
- Cornered at dumpster enclosure. Six closing in, walking, patient. Grins widening
- She **stopped.** Face slackened. Hands unclenched. Breathing went slow
- The grin — ~30 seconds. Faded to blank
- Walked to nearest group. Joined them. Resumed standing
- **Total elapsed: ~3 minutes**

- ~~**Conclusion:** They bite. That's how it spreads. Like every zombie movie.~~
- **Conclusion:** No bite. No contact. She was fine until she panicked. The panic changed her. Ricky was angry, not scared, and he made it. ~~This isn't a disease that spreads by contact.~~ This is something else.

### FEMA Advisories

1. Shelter in place. Avoid contact. Do NOT restrain.
2. *"Avoid strenuous physical activity and high-stress situations. Remain calm."*
3. *"Affected individuals retain basic biological functions. Do not assume they will become incapacitated without intervention."*

### Day 2 — Working Hypotheses

1. They orient toward sound. They don't pursue fast-moving targets.
2. ~~They're dying. They'll collapse in a few days.~~ They eat, drink, forage. You cannot wait this out.
3. ~~They're mindless. Shuffling. Random.~~ They herd. Geometry. Coordinated, not random.
4. ~~It spreads by bite/contact.~~ Fear/panic triggers the change. Calm = untouched. One data point. Not science yet.
5. Between active behaviors, they stand still. They conserve.
6. The grin happens near someone panicking. Gets wider the closer they are.
7. They face the sun. Don't know why.
8. Pembrook's skin is changing. Sun-exposed areas only. Don't know why.

~~**Working plan:** Board up. Ration food. Wait for the military / CDC / someone with a plan. They're slow. Rescue is coming.~~

## Day 3 (Sunday night)

**2247** — Knock at front door. Three knocks. Polite.

Voice: Lisa Anderson's. Exact. She turned six hours ago.

Used Lisa's voice first (neighborly concern), then **Mom's voice.** Perfect — warmth, tiredness, pause before "bud."

"I brought Chick-fil-A."

**She doesn't bring Chick-fil-A.** She brings Whataburger. Mom turns left out of Johnson Regional, passes the Taco Bell, hits the Whataburger. Every time. Closest Chick-fil-A is 25 minutes away in Russellville — Lisa Anderson's commute, not Mom's. The organism used Lisa's neural architecture to puppet Mom's voice. Grabbed the wrong woman's memory.

"Happy Friday, bud." Said it again. And again. Like a record skipping.

**Duration: 45 minutes.**

- ~~**Conclusion:** They're mindless shells. Empty. Whatever the person was is gone.~~
- **Conclusion:** They access host memories. Mimicry is targeted — the stimulus most likely to provoke an emotional response. They find the thing you miss most and put it on the other side of a door. ~~The person is gone.~~ The person's *memories* are still in there, being *used.*
- **Conclusion (textbook):** The sympathetic nervous system is involuntary. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol — produced by adrenal glands in response to perceived threat. Beta-blockers suppress this system. HPA axis: three organs that decide whether you live or die based on chemicals you can't consciously control.

---

## Day 3 (Monday)

### The Playlist

| Name | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Pembrook | Stands. Orients to sun. Drinks from spigot. Forages garbage. Grins when stimulus present |
| Lisa Anderson | Joined group. Resumed standing. Now used for voice mimicry |
| Strangers 1 & 2 | Stand. Eat from garden. Orient with group |
| Others (5-6) | Arrived during Anderson incident. Drawn by noise/fear |

**Turned count in park:** 11. Standing in a pattern that covers exits. **A net.**

**Observation:** Pastor Jim walks between his house and church every day. Nothing happens to him.
- **Conclusion:** The variable isn't location. It's something about the quality of his movement.

### Henderson Mistake — 1515

Wanted better vantage. Laundry building, 80 feet of gravel. Watched for one hour. Two Turned visible, clear path.

- 20 ft: Turned oriented toward me. 180 lbs on gravel is not quiet
- 30 ft: third one in laundry building shadow — **missed from window**
- Ran. Knocked propane tank. Summoning call — low vibrating drone
- Under Henderson's trailer. 18 inches. Seven hours

**Observations under trailer:**
- Face appeared at gap in skirting. 10 seconds. Withdrew. **They didn't tear the skirting off.** In small numbers, they don't dismantle structures.
- Temperature dropped to low forties. Shaking. **The cold killed the panic.** Fear and cold compete for the same energy. Cold wins. By hour three: just miserable. By hour five: one thought — survive this minute.
- Turned drifted away. By 0200: quiet
- Walked back. Slow. Single small sounds. No heads turned

- **Conclusion:** When frozen and unable to panic, they lost interest. When I walked slow, they ignored me. The state of the body is the variable. Not location. Not proximity.
- **Conclusion (textbook):** Cold-induced sympatholytic effect. Hypothermia suppresses the HPA axis.
- ~~**Resolution:** Stay hidden. Stay quiet. Stay inside. Outlast them.~~
- **Resolution:** Don't go somewhere you haven't watched first. Don't assume empty means empty. Don't assume your body can do what your mind plans. ~~Hiding works.~~ Hiding is *temporary.*

---

## Day 4 (Tuesday)

**~0800** — Sienna Okafor. Back door. No knock. Moved between trailers using gaps under skirting.

She's been observing independently. Reads the Turned's gait — which were athletes, which are new arrivals based on coordination changes. She sees transitions where I see positions.

**She has a blood pressure cuff.** Her correction: "You're tracking their positions. You should be tracking ours."
- My resting HR: normal. Hers: HR 82, BP 126/80. Higher — stress heart rate vs resting heart rate are different systems.

### Military Convoy (Sienna's intel)

Six Humvees, two trucks at interchange. ~40 soldiers. Engaged the Turned — short bursts, disciplined. Turned kept coming. **The shooting was turning the soldiers.** Combat spiking their stress past the threshold. The more they fought, the faster they crossed.

**Twenty minutes. Forty soldiers. Gone.**

Last one — a sergeant. Stopped shooting. Stood there. They walked right past him.
- ~~**Conclusion:** The military will handle this. They have weapons, training, logistics.~~
- **Conclusion:** Weapons are worse than useless. Combat is the thing that turns you. The sergeant figured it out: abandon every instinct in the moment those instincts are loudest. ~~The cavalry is coming.~~ The cavalry is already gone.

### Day 4 — Updated Rules

1. **The mechanism is in the body.** The HPA axis. Adrenaline, cortisol. Stay under the threshold, they lose interest. Cross it, you're gone.
2. **They use memories.** Targeted mimicry to spike your chemistry.
3. ~~They're dying. They'll collapse.~~ **They eat, drink, forage, maintain.** You cannot wait this out.
4. **They orient to sound and fear.** Noise draws them. Panic draws more.
5. ~~They're mindless, shuffling, random.~~ **They herd, not hunt** (in small numbers). Geometry. Cut off exits. Wait.
6. **In small numbers they don't dismantle structures.** They conserve energy between active behaviors.
7. **Don't go somewhere you haven't watched first.**
8. **Cold suppresses the stress response.** Not a strategy. Worth knowing.
9. **Jim is on something.** Beta-blockers, maybe. Need to confirm.
10. ~~Hide alone. Ration. Wait for rescue.~~ **Cooperation is the only play that scales.** Iterated prisoner's dilemma. Tit-for-tat. Sienna is my first cooperator.

---

## Day 5 (Tuesday)

**~0715** — Crossed Highway 21 with Sienna. 200 yards to Jim's church. Six Turned visible.

**Pembrook skin:** Discoloration darker than two days ago. Greyish-green spreading down forearms.
- ~~**Conclusion:** Decomposition? They're breaking down.~~
- **Conclusion:** Whatever is happening to them is progressing. Not decomposing — *changing.* Not static.

**~0720** — Turned man in Carhartt jacket took two steps toward us. Head cocked. Ten seconds. Turned away.
- **Conclusion:** Calm movement works. Walked through them. They registered us and chose not to engage. ~~One data point on the fear mechanism. Not science yet.~~ **Multiple data points now. The threshold is real.**

**Jim's sign:** Hand-lettered cardboard in church window: **KEEP CALM. COME INSIDE. DON'T RUN.** Angle, letter size, placement — all deliberate. The reason we knew where to go.

---

## Days 5–7 (Tuesday–Thursday)

### Mechanism Confirmed

~~**Rule 9: Jim is on something.** Beta-blockers, maybe. Need to confirm.~~

**Metoprolol. 50mg, twice daily.** Beta-blocker. Suppresses the sympathetic nervous system.

Jim framed his survival as theology: "The Lord protects the peaceful." His conclusion identical to mine — stay calm, don't fight, don't flee. Different reasoning. Same behavior.
- **Conclusion:** Wrong reasons can produce right answers. His faith produced the sign in the window, which saved lives. My correct mechanism produced a notebook.
- **Conclusion (textbook):** Cognitive dissonance — holding contradictory beliefs without collapsing to resolution. Jim holds "God protects the peaceful" and "metoprolol suppresses the HPA axis" simultaneously. That capacity is more important than either truth alone.

### Additional pharmacological survivors

- **Dale Soto:** Suboxone (opioid maintenance). Flattens emotional spikes. In normal life, a problem. In this, survival.
- **Conclusion:** Jim's metoprolol. Dale's Suboxone. My hypothermia. The sergeant. Every data point: suppress the stress chemistry, they lose interest. ~~This is a virus. A pathogen. Something that infects.~~ This is a chemical threshold. The body converts itself.

### Food supply

**16 days** at current rationing. 20 if we cut portions. Less with more people. More people will arrive.
- ~~**Resolution:** Ration carefully. The church can hold out until help comes.~~
- **Resolution:** Know the cost of every mouth you feed. Cooperation still scales, but the timeline is finite. ~~Help is coming.~~ Help is not coming.

### Interchange scout (Day 6, Sienna)

- Military vehicles still there. 15–20 Turned, scattered, not coordinated
- Bodies from the firefight still there
- **The Turned are eating them.** Methodical. Crouching, taking pieces one at a time. Rationing. Six bodies remaining — there were more

**New behavior:** Territorial/protective around the bodies. Not herding. Not the grin. Like a dog guarding food.

~~**Rule 5: They herd, not hunt.**~~

- **Conclusion:** Two different drives. Reproduction (herding, fear-targeting, the grin) and calories (territorial, protective feeding). ~~They only want to convert you.~~ They also want to eat.
- **Resolution:** We are made of calories. When the easy food is gone, the search radius expands.

### Walmart cluster (Day 6, observed from steeple)

~25 Turned. Tighter spacing than normal. Some twitchy — jerky movements, heads snapping at nothing.

~~Between active behaviors, they stand still. They conserve.~~

- **Conclusion:** Something changes at density. At ~25, they agitate instead of conserve. A threshold where coordination breaks down into something worse.
- **Resolution:** Watch this.

---

## Day 8 (Friday)

### Marcus Webb

42. Long-haul driver, Tulsa. Survived three days in a truck cab on bourbon.
- Bourbon suppresses stress response short-term. Then you rebound worse than baseline.
- Marcus's calm is different — the flat affect of long-term depression. The organism can't spike what's already broken.
- **Conclusion:** Another neurochemical survivor. The pattern holds.

### Road intel (Marcus)

- **Walmart:** Almost stripped. Another week, bare shelves
- **Highways:** Funnels. Interchanges and rest stops are congregation points. ~~Can we drive to safety?~~ No. A car engine is the loudest thing in a silent world. ~~Roads are escape routes.~~ Roads are traps.
- **Back roads:** Better. Low traffic before, low density now. But connection points to highways are bad
- **Off-road:** Boston Mountains — bluffs, ravines. No vehicle gets through
- **The OHT:** Ozark Highlands Trail. Ridgelines through national forest. Forest service roads every 10–15 miles. No population. Turned go where people were. People weren't in the deep woods
- **Resolution:** The OHT is the route. Sixty miles. Insane. Best option.

### CB Radio — Dr. Eleanor Moss

Channel 9 (emergency): Automated loop, five days, nobody updating it. ~~The government is coordinating a response.~~ The government is a recording playing to empty rooms.

**Channel 21 — Dr. Moss.** Broadcasts twice daily. Fragments:

- *"mechanism is endocrine"* — ~~The mechanism is in the body (vague)~~ **Confirmed: endocrine. Catecholamine levels specifically**
- *"beta-adrenergic antagonists are protective"* — Confirmed by an actual scientist
- *"organism's protein structures do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny"* — ~~Some kind of virus. A mutation. A bioweapon.~~ **Not from here. Not any of those things. Not terrestrial**
- A frequency that *"disrupts collective coordination"* — **There is a countermeasure. Acoustic**
- University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. State Route 16. 60 miles NW
- *"every fortress is a countdown"*

**Full broadcast (Thursday, clearer signal):** *"I have data. I have a frequency. I have medication. If you can reach me —"*

- **Resolution:** Dr. Moss has answers. Fayetteville is the destination.

### Day 8 — Updated Rules

1. ~~The mechanism is in the body.~~ **The mechanism is endocrine.** Catecholamines — epinephrine, norepinephrine. Beta-adrenergic antagonists protective. Confirmed: Jim's metoprolol, Dale's Suboxone, my hypothermia, the sergeant, Dr. Moss.
2. **They use memories.** Targeted mimicry. *(Unchanged.)*
3. ~~They're dying. They'll collapse.~~ ~~They eat, drink, forage, maintain.~~ **They eat everything — forage, garbage, the dead.** Two drives: reproduction through fear, calories through feeding.
4. **They orient to sound and fear.** *(Unchanged.)*
5. ~~They're mindless and random.~~ ~~They herd, not hunt.~~ **They herd to reproduce. They feed to sustain. Different drives, different behaviors.**
6. **In small numbers they don't dismantle structures.** *(But every fortress is a countdown.)*
7. **Don't go somewhere you haven't watched first.** *(Unchanged.)*
8. **Cold suppresses the stress response.** *(Unchanged.)*
9. ~~Jim is on something. Maybe beta-blockers.~~ **Confirmed: Metoprolol 50mg 2x daily.**
10. ~~Hide alone. Wait for rescue.~~ **Cooperation scales.** Seven cooperators now.
11. **NEW — Density changes behavior.** ~25 at Walmart — agitated, twitchy. A threshold exists.
12. **NEW — Every fortress is a countdown.** Turned count up. Food count down. You cannot stay.
13. **NEW — The OHT to Fayetteville.** 60 miles through wilderness. Dr. Moss has data, medication, a frequency. This is the plan.
14. ~~This is a virus/pathogen/bioweapon.~~ **The organism is not terrestrial.**

### The Six Clocks

1. **Organism adaptation** — Pembrook's skin progressing. They're becoming something else.
2. **Conversion** — 15 Turned and counting. The net tightens.
3. **Medication** — Jim's metoprolol, Dale's Suboxone. Finite supply.
4. **Siege** — More Turned = more coverage = fewer exits.
5. **Psychological** — Everyone has a breaking point. The clocks don't care.
6. **Hunger** — Walmart almost stripped. Interchange bodies being rationed. When easy food is gone, the search radius expands toward us.

All six converge on the same zero: the moment staying is more dangerous than going.
