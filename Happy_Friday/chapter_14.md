# Chapter 14: The Septic Tank

Two days after the pharmacy run I did the stupidest thing I have ever done, and I include in that assessment the full catalogue of stupid things I have done in fifteen years of being a person with bad judgment and worse cardio.

I went scouting. Alone. Without telling anyone.

The reasoning was sound. This is the dangerous thing about bad decisions — they often start with good logic. We needed a map of the surrounding blocks: which houses were occupied by Turned, which were empty, which might have useful supplies. Sienna had been scouting, but her scouting was instinctive and unstructured — she'd go out, move fast, come back with impressions. I wanted data. Grid squares. Counts. An asset map cross-referenced with the Turned position log I'd been keeping from the steeple. And I wanted to do it myself because I was the one who understood the data, and because the pharmacy run had made me feel smart. The PDR research, the medication alternatives, the way I'd walked Dale through the pharmacology while everyone else was celebrating with grape juice. Smart became informed, informed became prepared, prepared became invulnerable. And invulnerable is the most dangerous feeling in the world because it's the one that makes you walk into a house alone at 5:30 AM with a notebook and no exit plan.

Jim and Marcus had walked eight blocks and back. Sienna went to the military interchange. I was the one who hadn't gone anywhere except the steeple. But that wasn't the real reason I went. The real reason was vanity — the same vanity that had sent me to the Lyles, the belief that my understanding was superior, dressed up as initiative.

So I went. 5:30 AM, just after dawn. I left a note on the table — "Scouting nearby blocks, back by 8" — which I told myself counted as telling people. It did not. I left the walkie-talkie on the charging shelf. If I'd taken it, someone would have heard the click and woken up and asked where I was going, and I didn't want to be asked because being asked meant admitting this was a decision.

The first three houses went fine. That's the sentence that should terrify you. "Fine" is the sound confidence makes before it kills you.

I moved slowly. Checked windows. Marked occupancy on a hand-drawn grid in the notebook. House one, Elm Street: empty, front door open, no supplies visible. House two: Turned inside, a man sitting at a kitchen table, staring at the wall, motionless. I watched him through the window for two minutes and he didn't move. House three: empty, pantry stocked — I noted the address for a future supply run.

House four was a ranch-style place on Oak, one story, attached garage. I went through a back window that was already broken — someone had tried to get in or out before me. The glass crunched under my shoes. I noticed the crunch and didn't account for it, because I was feeling competent.

Inside: canned food in the pantry. A hand-crank radio on the kitchen counter. A set of tools in the garage. I was loading the backpack I'd brought — one of Marcus's, canvas, military surplus — when I heard the sound.

The drone. Low, vibrating, chest-resonant. The summoning call. Coming from outside, from the front of the house, from everywhere.

I went to the living room window.

Turned were coming. Not from one direction — from every direction. Walking in from the cross streets, emerging from between houses, converging on this house with the methodical precision of a net closing. I counted: five, ten, fifteen. Twenty. Twenty-five. I stopped counting at thirty because my hands were shaking and the binoculars — I'd brought them, I always brought them — were vibrating against my face.

I had made myself a data point. Thirty-plus Turned, converging on a single-story house with plywood-on-nothing walls, and me inside with a backpack full of canned peaches and no exit I'd tested. The organism had detected me — maybe the glass crunching, maybe scent, maybe the collective's pattern recognition flagging a house that had changed state from "empty" to "occupied" — and it had sent the net.

I knew about the density threshold. I'd written about it. I'd warned Craig Lyle about it. And now I was inside the threshold, watching it build in real time, and the distance between understanding a concept and being inside the concept was the distance between reading about drowning and having water in your lungs.

---

The house had no basement. The attic had a pull-down ladder — noisy. The garage had a rolling door — exposed. The back door opened onto a yard that was already filling with Turned coming around the sides of the house. They moved without hurry. They didn't need to hurry. The net was the tactic and the net was already closed.

Behind the backyard, across a chain-link fence, an older property. Overgrown. Weeds waist-high. And in the weeds, barely visible, a concrete disk — a septic tank access port. Decommissioned, probably, judging by the age of the house and the municipal sewer hookup I could see at the property line. The kind of thing you'd miss if you weren't looking for it.

I wasn't looking for it. I saw it.

My brain divided into two processes. Process one: rational analysis, calculating odds, noting that thirty-plus Turned on a residential lot was past any reasonable threshold. Process two: animal terror screaming *RUN NOW GO NOW MOVE* with a volume that drowns out everything else.

Process two won.

I went out the back door. I ran — thirty yards of gasping, wheezing sprint across the yard. I hit the chain-link fence and went over it with a coordination I did not know I possessed, fueled by the same adrenaline the organism was trying to harvest. I crashed through the weeds. I grabbed the concrete lid of the access port — it weighed maybe forty pounds, and I lifted it like it was cardboard because the body's emergency system has a turbo mode and it doesn't care about your usual limitations. I dropped into the tank.

It was partially drained. Decommissioned. But not empty — there was maybe ten inches of standing waste in the bottom, old and settled and black, and the smell was a physical substance, thick and wet and coated, entering through the nose and the mouth and the pores. My shoes sank into it. My stomach convulsed. I pulled the concrete lid back over the opening — scraping, grinding, and then dark, total dark — and I stood in human waste up to my shins in perfect blackness and pressed my hands over my mouth because vomiting is loud and loud is death.

---

Time does things in the dark.

I don't know how long I stood there before the sound changed. Twenty minutes? Thirty? The drone was audible through the concrete — muffled, felt more than heard, a vibration in the bones of the tank and through the soles of my shoes and up into my legs. Then footsteps above. Many footsteps. The collective had reached the house.

The sound that came next is the thing I don't talk about.

A roaring. Not voices — not the human sounds the Turned usually made, the mimicry, the drone. This was structural: wood splitting, glass shattering, something heavy being overturned and overturned again. The ranch house was coming apart. The swarm had hit threshold and the patient herding had collapsed into undirected destruction and the Turned were tearing through the house the way a tornado tears through a mobile home — not aimed, not purposeful, just force. Raw collective force applied to whatever was in reach.

It went on for an hour. Maybe longer. In the dark, in the tank, with the waste soaking through my clothes and the smell destroying my ability to think about anything except not vomiting, I pressed my hands over my ears and counted prime numbers. Two, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-three, twenty-nine. I counted them because they were orderly and because orderly things were the only defense I had against the chaos above me. The primes were reliable. They followed rules. They didn't change their minds or tear through walls or use your mother's voice to lure you outside.

At 89 the primes stopped working.

I don't mean I forgot the sequence. I mean the numbers stopped being a wall and became sounds my mouth made while the rest of me went somewhere else. Because the house above me was being torn apart and I was standing in human waste in the dark and I was fifteen years old and I was going to die here and nobody knew where I was because I'd left a *note*. The terror filled the tank the way the waste filled my shoes and I couldn't count around it the way you can't breathe around water.

My heart was hammering. Not the managed rhythm Jim had taught, not the four-in-hold-six-out, but the runaway cascade — 140, 150, higher, the kind of heart rate that exists for one biological purpose, which is to fuel a sprint, and I couldn't sprint because I was in a concrete box four feet wide and if I pushed the lid off and ran they would tear me apart the way they were tearing the house apart and that thought — the image of it, the sound of it translated to my body — pushed the rate higher and the rate pushing higher made the fear worse and the fear made the rate worse and I understood in a way I hadn't before that this was the loop, this was the mechanism, this was how the organism won. Not by catching you. By letting your own chemistry do the catching.

Then the warmth came.

It started in my chest. A spreading heat, not unpleasant — not the burn of exertion but something softer, like a muscle unclenching that you didn't know was clenched. It moved outward through my arms, into my hands, up through my throat and into the base of my skull. My hands stopped shaking. My jaw unclenched. For a fraction of a second it felt like relief and that was the most terrifying part — that the thing trying to unmake me felt *good.*

The edges of me went soft. The parts that were Nate — the name, the weight, the self-consciousness, the mother I was trying not to think about — started to feel like things I was holding instead of things I was. Like I could set them down. Like there was a surface somewhere in the dark where I could place them carefully and walk away lighter. The organism wasn't attacking. It was *inviting.* The gentlest thing I'd ever felt, and it was dissolving me.

I had maybe seconds. I knew this the way you know you're falling before you hit. The prime numbers were gone. Jim's breathing was gone. The analytical framework I'd built my entire identity around was tissue paper and the warmth was burning through it and behind the warmth was something vast and patient and utterly without malice. You can't fight something that isn't fighting you.

So I did the only thing I could think of. I dropped my hands from my ears, bent down, and shoved my face into the waste.

Not metaphorically. Not a splash. I plunged both hands into the black standing sewage at the bottom of the tank and brought them up to my face and pressed the filth against my nose and mouth and breathed in — a full, deliberate, gasping inhalation of the most revolting substance I had ever encountered. The smell hit my brainstem like a fist. My stomach convulsed so violently that I doubled over. My eyes flooded. I gagged, retched, retched again, the reflex so total and so involuntary that every other signal in my body — the warmth, the invitation, the gentle dissolution — was obliterated by the sheer biological imperative of *revulsion.*

The warmth shattered. The softness at my edges snapped back into hardness. I was Nate again — Nate in a septic tank, Nate covered in filth, Nate retching in the dark with sewage on his face and tears streaming from his eyes, but *Nate.* The organism's invitation couldn't compete with the body's oldest and most violent reflex. Disgust is older than fear. It's the immune system's scream, and it doesn't negotiate and it doesn't dissolve. I had found the one feeling more powerful than terror: the body's absolute refusal to accept contamination.

I was shaking. I was crying. I was wiping sewage from my face with a sleeve already soaked in sewage, which accomplished nothing except smearing it around, and I was laughing — the high thin laugh of a person who has just done something so disgusting and so desperate and so *effective* that the only response left is the sound your brain makes when it can't process what you've done.

I started the primes again. From 2. The numbers came back. Two, three, five, seven. The walls of the tank were solid. The dark was just dark. I counted, and this time the counting held, because behind the counting was the taste of sewage and the knowledge that I had been *that close* — seconds, maybe less. That knowledge was a better wall than any prime number. Cold, clenched, purposeful fear — the fear of a person who has seen the edge and will do anything to not go back.

I got to 547 before the sounds stopped. I don't know if 547 is prime. I think it is. I never checked. It doesn't matter. What matters is that by the time the destruction ended I had been standing in a septic tank for approximately three hours and my legs had gone numb and my hands were shaking so badly I couldn't have held the binoculars if I'd had them and my entire body was coated in a film of waste that I could feel on my skin like a second layer of something that was not me.

The frenzy burned out. Moss had described this — the swarm's feedback loop was self-limiting. The collective violence escalated to a peak and then the signal scattered, the coordination broke, and the Turned dispersed in ones and twos, dazed, almost confused, like people waking from a blackout. The footsteps above thinned. The drone faded. A deep silence settled — the silence of aftermath.

I waited. I waited until it was fully dark — hours after the last sound, hours of standing in the tank in the blackness with nothing to do but exist inside the consequences of my own confidence. Then I pushed the lid. It scraped. The night air hit me and I breathed it and it was the best breath I have ever taken and it was immediately followed by the worst, because the second breath carried my own smell back to me and I understood for the first time the full dimension of what I had done and what I was covered in and what I smelled like and I leaned over and vomited into the weeds and it didn't matter because nothing I produced could be worse than what was already on me.

I walked back to the church. In the dark. By memory. Moving slow, step by step, through streets I'd mapped from the steeple but had never walked at night. The Turned were in their positions but scattered thin — the post-frenzy dispersal. None approached. I don't know if this was because I was moving slowly or because I smelled like a septic tank and even the Turned had standards.

---

Sienna was at the side door.

She'd been there for hours. I could see it — the puffiness around her eyes, the rigid set of her jaw, the posture of a person who has been standing in one place holding themselves together through an act of will that has nothing left to hold. She'd thought I was dead. She'd heard the swarm from the church — everyone had — and she'd thought I was inside it.

She saw me. She smelled me. Her face went through relief, then fury, then something I couldn't name.

"Oh my God, Nate. Oh my *God.*"

I walked past her. I couldn't talk. Not because I was choosing not to — because the machinery of speech had been offline for six hours and I didn't know how to restart it. I went to the rain barrel behind the church and tipped it over myself. The water was cold and it wasn't enough — not nearly enough — but it ran over me and carried some of the waste away and I stood there in the dark while the water ran out and Sienna stood three feet away not touching me and not leaving.

"I thought you were dead," she said. Her voice was level. The level voice was worse than screaming would have been. "I thought you were inside that house when they tore it apart. I heard it. We all heard it. Ruth was praying. Dale stopped carving. Maria started counting the food supply because that's what Maria does when she thinks someone's died — she recalculates. And I stood at this door for six hours and I didn't know if you were dead or turned or —"

"I was in a septic tank."

Silence.

"A septic —"

"A decommissioned septic tank behind the property east of the house. I dropped in and pulled the lid over and stood in it while they tore the house apart."

Another silence. Longer.

"You stood in a septic tank."

"For approximately six hours. Yes."

She stared at me. The moonlight caught her face and I watched her process this — the horror, the absurdity, the specific lunacy of a fifteen-year-old boy standing waist-deep in sewage in the dark counting prime numbers while the world destroyed itself above him — and something in her expression broke and the break was not grief and was not fury. She laughed.

It was short. One breath. More of a bark than a laugh. But it was real, and it was the first time I'd heard anyone laugh since before the Turned, and the sound of it cracked something in my chest that had been sealed shut for days.

"It's not funny," I said.

"It's a little funny."

"I was standing in human waste."

"And you survived. That's —" She stopped laughing. Her eyes were wet. "That's the most you thing possible. Everyone else would have fought or run or frozen. You hid in a toilet."

"It wasn't a toilet. It was a septic —"

"Nate. Shut up. Come inside." She paused. "Actually, don't come inside. You can't come inside smelling like that. Jim has church donation clothes in the office. I'll get them. Burn what you're wearing."

She went inside. I stood by the empty rain barrel in church-donation boxers and no shirt, shivering, holding my ruined clothes in a wad. When she came back with a pair of too-large khakis and a polo shirt that said ROTARY CLUB — DOVER CHAPTER on the chest, she handed them to me without looking and went back inside and I stood in the dark and got dressed and tried to feel something other than ashamed and failed.

---

I sat in the basement. My hands were still shaking. Jim had given me coffee — the last of the instant, reheated over a candle, terrible — and Ruth had looked at me once and said "You're an idiot" and gone back upstairs and that was Ruth's version of "I'm glad you're alive" and I understood the translation.

I opened the notebook. The pages were wrinkled — the notebook had been in my back pocket in the tank — and they smelled. Everything smelled. I would smell for days. The smell would become a joke and then a reference point and then a unit of measurement. Sienna would later say, during a particularly bad stretch of the trail, "This is about 0.6 septic tanks," and everyone would know exactly what she meant.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #9:**

*Lessons:*

*(1) Never go alone. I wrote this after Henderson's trailer. I didn't follow it. The lesson doesn't work if you don't follow it.*

*(2) Always have an exit you've already tested. I went into a house I'd never been in through a window I'd never used and my only exit was a septic tank I found by luck. Luck is not a strategy.*

*(3) The swarm threshold is real. It's not a concept. It's the sound of a house being torn apart by thirty human bodies moving in coordinated frenzy with no self-preservation and no off switch. You cannot calm your way through it. You can only not be there when it happens.*

*(4) Confidence is the thing that nearly killed me. Not fear — confidence. I went because the pharmacy run worked and because working made me feel like I knew what I was doing and knowing what you're doing is the most dangerous feeling in the world because it makes you forget that the world doesn't care what you know.*

*(5) I almost turned. In the tank. The panic broke through the counting and I felt it — the warmth, the dissolving, the invitation. The organism doesn't fight you. It opens a door and waits. I stopped it by shoving my face into the waste and breathing in, because disgust is older than fear and the body's revulsion reflex overrides everything else. This is not a technique I can recommend. This is not a technique at all. It's what happens when a fifteen-year-old is out of options and discovers that the most disgusting thing in reach is also the only thing that can save him.*

*(6) If your only option is a septic tank, take the septic tank. You will hate yourself but you will be alive to hate yourself and alive is the prerequisite for everything else.*

*(7) Tell people where you're going. Take the radio. I left a note and left the walkie-talkie on the shelf because taking it meant someone would know and knowing meant arguing and arguing meant admitting I'd made a choice. A note is cowardice in written form. A radio left behind is cowardice in silence. If I'd had the radio, someone in the steeple could have warned me about the convergence. If I'd told someone, they'd have talked me out of going alone. Sienna stood at the door for six hours thinking I was dead and that is worse than the septic tank and worse than the swarm and worse than anything I've done in my life.*

*(8) Sienna laughed. In the middle of the worst night of my life, while I was standing in the dark covered in sewage, she laughed. It was the first laugh since before the Turned. I think laughter might be a survival tool. Not because it's calming — it's not, it spikes the heart rate — but because it's the sound the brain makes when it encounters something so far outside its model that the only response is to reboot. She rebooted. I needed it more than I needed the rain barrel.*

I slept that night. I didn't mean to — I'd planned to stay awake, stay in the steeple, make up for the hours I'd cost the group. But the body overrules the plan. I fell asleep on the pew in the basement, still smelling like the tank despite two more washings, and I dreamed of the dark.

Not the septic tank. Something larger. An infinite version of the same space — no walls, no lid, no bottom. Just dark, extending in every direction, and somewhere above me the sound of the house being torn apart. Not close. Not approaching. Just constant, like weather. The tearing was the texture of the world. And I was standing in it with my hands at my sides and I couldn't move, not because I was frozen but because there was nowhere to move *to*. Every direction was the same dark. Every step would land in the same place.

I woke with my fists clenched so hard that my palms were marked with crescent moons from my fingernails. Four deep impressions in each hand, the skin white and then flushing red. For a disoriented second I thought my fingers were pruned — waterlogged — and the tank rushed back and my heart spiked and I pressed my thumb against my wrist and counted. The count took longer than usual. The dream didn't want to let go.

---

The next morning Sienna came to the steeple while I was on watch. She sat down across from me and didn't say anything for a long time. I knew this silence — it was the one she used when she was choosing words, which meant the words were going to matter.

"You keep doing this thing," she said.

"Which thing? I do a lot of things. Most of them badly."

"That. That right there. The joke. The *I'm just a fat kid in a steeple* routine. You did it before the septic tank too — 'I'm the strategy kid, not the action kid.' You said it like it was a joke. Then you went alone into a house full of Turned because nobody expected you to actually *do* anything, because you'd already told everyone not to expect it."

I didn't say anything because she was right and I didn't have a joke for that.

"The note," she said. "You left a note because you didn't want anyone to argue with you. Because if someone argued, you'd have to defend the decision, and defending it would mean admitting you'd *made* a decision, and making decisions is the thing you keep telling yourself you can't do because you're fifteen and overweight and you get winded on stairs."

"I do get winded on stairs."

"Everyone gets winded on stairs, Nate. The stairs aren't the point." She leaned forward. "The point is you keep building this case — this really smart, really funny, really airtight case — for why you can't be responsible for anything. And as long as nothing is your responsibility, nothing is your fault. And as long as nothing is your fault, you never have to sit with the fact that you could have done better. It's perfect. It's the perfect defense. And it's going to get someone killed."

The binoculars were in my hands and I was gripping them hard enough that the rubber eyepieces were deforming.

"I went into that house," I said. "I made a decision. I —"

"You went into that house and left a *note*. That's not a decision. That's running away with documentation." She paused. "You're the smartest person I've ever met. You see things nobody else sees. But you use the smart to build reasons why you can't act, instead of plans for how to act better. And I'm telling you this because —" Her voice changed. Went quieter. "Because the next time you go alone and leave a note, I might not be standing at the door when you come back. And you need to decide whether that matters to you more than being right about your own limitations."

She went downstairs. I sat in the steeple and looked through the binoculars and didn't see anything because my eyes were blurring and I told myself it was the cold air and it wasn't the cold air.
