# Chapter 3: The Thing Mr. Pembrook Did

Sunday. Day two. I didn't turn the TV on. I'd killed it yesterday after realizing the sound was drawing attention, and in the dark hours of the morning the memory of that drifting stranger — the one who'd been walking toward my end of the park while the newscasters murmured — was enough to keep my hand off the remote. Instead I checked my phone, volume at zero, brightness low.

The coverage had changed. The news sites had shifted from "we don't know what's happening" to "here is more of what's happening and we still don't know why." The scope was confirmed: every continent, every major city, the same phenomenon. The details were getting stranger. A BBC article described Turned in London entering a Tesco through broken windows and consuming food directly off the shelves. A wire service report from Japan mentioned groups of Turned standing knee-deep in rivers, faces down, drinking. An Australian outlet, with clinical understatement, reported that Turned in rural Queensland were killing and consuming livestock in ways described as "methodical."

The FEMA site had posted a new advisory at 4 AM. The crawl read: **AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS RETAIN BASIC BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. DO NOT ASSUME THEY WILL BECOME INCAPACITATED WITHOUT INTERVENTION. CONTINUE TO SHELTER IN PLACE.**

*Do not assume they will become incapacitated.* I read that three times. It meant: don't wait for them to fall over. It meant someone at FEMA had realized what I was starting to realize — that these things were eating and drinking and maintaining themselves, and waiting them out was not a plan.

I'd slept in my mom's bed. Her room is at the back of the trailer, away from the drive, with the one window that faces the wooded hillside where nobody goes. I took her pillow because it smelled like her shampoo — the coconut kind from Dollar General — and that was sentimental and I'm not going to apologize for it.

The trailer was worse in the morning. Not structurally worse — the same thin walls, the same vinyl floor, the same countertop with the burn mark from when I put a hot pan down without a trivet and she didn't yell at me, just looked at the mark and sighed and said, "Well, now it has character." All of that was still there. But the systems that made it a home were unwinding. The coffee maker hadn't run because nobody set it. The bathroom smelled like my soap, not hers. Her reading glasses were on the arm of the chair at the exact angle she'd left them, and they would stay at that angle forever now, or until I moved them, and either option felt like a violation.

The trailer was becoming a museum of Friday, October 24th — the last day someone lived here instead of just surviving here — and every unchanged object was a timestamp marking the moment the world split.

I ate cereal. I went to the window.

Mr. Pembrook was in the same spot. I don't mean he'd gone inside and come back out. I mean he had been standing in the gravel between his unit and the next one, in his open bathrobe, in the same position, for what was now approaching twenty hours. A human being does not stand in one place for twenty hours. I knew this. My brain tagged it and filed it in the box where I was keeping things that didn't make sense yet.

The park had changed overnight. Two more figures had appeared — strangers, nobody I recognized, standing near the laundry building at the park entrance. Same posture as Pembrook: still, hands at sides, facing inward. They'd come from Highway 21, maybe, drawn to the park the way water is drawn to low ground. Three of them now, spaced across the park in a triangle that I didn't recognize as geometry yet but that some part of my brain was already noting.

I had my mom's bird-watching binoculars. She'd bought them three years ago during a brief and unsuccessful attempt to develop a hobby that wasn't work. They were good binoculars — 10x42, the kind that pull in a lot of light — and through them I could see details.

Mr. Pembrook's face. I focused on it for a full minute, looking for something I couldn't name. And I found it, though I didn't understand what I was finding. His expression was smooth. Neutral in a way that human faces don't naturally achieve — we always carry something, even at rest. Pembrook's face carried nothing. Everything in the right place, nothing behind it.

The two by the laundry building had the same quality. I panned the binoculars across their faces and felt something cold move through my chest. The feeling you get when you realize the AI has been making moves you didn't see, and the board is not what you thought it was.

One other thing. All three of them — Pembrook and the two strangers — were facing the same direction. East. Toward the morning sun. Their faces were tilted up slightly, like people at a beach, and the sunlight was falling directly on their skin. As I watched over the next hour, they shifted. Not their positions — their orientation. As the sun moved, they turned with it. Not dramatically, not all at once. Just a slow, collective reorientation, like sunflowers on a time-lapse.

I wrote this down in my notebook: *They face the sun. Don't know why.* I still don't know why. But Dr. Moss, when I eventually told her about it, put her pen down and stared at me for a long time and then said, "How early did you notice that?" and when I said "Day two," she said something under her breath that I think was "Jesus Christ" but might have been something else.

I was removing the fog of war. I didn't like what was underneath.

I panned the binoculars across the park. Slow. Methodical. Taking inventory.

One of the strangers by the laundry building had moved. Not far — she'd drifted maybe twenty feet toward the Garcias' empty trailer, and she was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched, the way you'd crouch to look at something on the ground. I focused.

She was eating.

The Garcias had a garden — a small one, three raised beds along the side of their unit, tomatoes and peppers mostly, the kind of thing you grow when you're trying to save money on groceries. The plants were still producing in late October, the last ragged tomatoes hanging on the vine. The woman was pulling them off and eating them whole — not biting, not chewing with any apparent process, just putting them into her mouth and working her jaw. Green ones, ripe ones, it didn't matter. She ate methodically, without pleasure or haste, the way a machine processes fuel. When the tomatoes were gone she moved to the pepper plants and ate those too. Then she stood up, turned, and walked back to her position near the laundry building. Resumed standing. The whole thing had taken about four minutes.

But the way she'd moved to the garden was different from Pembrook's drift. She'd approached low, almost crouching, with the directness of a predator approaching a food source. Something purposeful, acquisitive. And her shoes — she'd been wearing shoes at the laundry building. Now they were off, placed neatly on the curb, side by side. The neatness was worse than the barefoot.

They weren't statues. They were organisms with needs. They ate, they drank, and between the eating and drinking they stood in their positions and waited. Waited for us.

The fact that they ate was the part that scared me most. A thing that eats plans to keep going. A thing that plans to keep going is not going to stop.

At approximately 8 AM, Ricky Sims three lots over started his truck.

Ricky was mid-twenties, worked at the Tyson plant, drove a black F-150 with a Confederate flag sticker on the tailgate that my mom said she "chose not to have feelings about." He came out his front door moving fast, keys in one hand, a duffel bag in the other. He threw the bag in the bed, got in, and cranked the engine. The truck roared to life and the sound was enormous in the silence — the first mechanical noise I'd heard since I turned the TV off.

All three Turned moved at once.

Not toward Ricky — toward the sound. Their heads swiveled in unison, smooth, tracking, the way a security camera follows motion. Then they began walking. Toward the truck. Not fast. The same steady, unhurried pace — maybe two miles an hour — that I would come to understand was their default when unstimulated. They conserve. They don't waste movement.

Ricky saw them. He did what Ricky would do: he revved the engine, threw it in reverse, and peeled out of his lot in a spray of gravel. The truck fishtailed on the drive, straightened, and blew past the laundry building toward Highway 21. The two by the entrance didn't try to block him. They turned their heads and watched him go.

He made it. He was gone. The three Turned stood in the positions they'd drifted to during their walk toward the noise, and after about a minute they drifted back to their original spots, like balloons returning to rest after a breeze.

I stored this: they oriented toward noise. They moved toward it. They didn't pursue a fast-moving target. They returned to positions afterward.

One more thing from that sequence. When the truck engine roared, before the Turned started walking, Pembrook's face changed. I had the binoculars on him and I saw it: a grin. Not a smile — a *grin*, sudden and wide and wrong, too many teeth, the corners of his mouth pulled back further than a mouth should go. It lasted maybe five seconds, from the moment the engine noise spiked to the moment Ricky's truck was already accelerating away. Then it faded — smoothed back to the blank, the neutral, the nothing. It happened fast enough that I almost convinced myself I'd imagined it. I hadn't imagined it. I would see that grin again, much closer, much worse, in about two hours.

The next two hours were quiet. I watched the park through the binoculars and scrolled my phone between observations. The news sites were updating less frequently now — fewer reporters, fewer updates, the same information reshuffled — but social media was still churning. A video from Chicago had gone viral overnight: a group of Turned moving through what looked like an open-air market, pulling food from stalls, eating standing up. One of them carried a whole watermelon under its arm for about thirty seconds, then stopped, smashed it on the pavement, and crouched over the pieces. The video was forty seconds long and had eleven million views and the top comment was just "what the fuck" with two hundred thousand upvotes, which was about right.

In the park, Mr. Pembrook had moved to the dumpster enclosure and was going through the communal garbage. I watched through the binoculars as he pulled out a trash bag, tore it open with both hands, and sorted through the contents. He ate something — I couldn't tell what, the angle was wrong — and discarded the rest.

In the morning light, with the binoculars at full magnification, I noticed something about his skin that I hadn't seen the day before. On his face and forearms — the sun-exposed skin — there was a faint discoloration. Not bruising. Not sunburn. More like a stain under the surface, a dull greenish-grey that I might have mistaken for a trick of the light except that it was only on the parts of him that had been facing the sun. I didn't know what to do with that information so I wrote it down in my notebook and drew a circle around it, which is what I do when something seems important but I can't explain why. It didn't mean anything to me yet. It meant something to Dr. Moss, later, and what it meant was the worst news anyone had ever received, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

He walked back to his lot, that steady two-mile-an-hour pace, and resumed standing. The two by the laundry building hadn't moved.

They were on Day Two of existing, and they'd already figured out garbage.

At around 10 AM, Lisa Anderson came out of her trailer.

---

I was still operating on the zombie-movie framework. The one thing I thought I knew — the one thing every movie agrees on — is how it spreads: contact. Bites. Scratches. Bodily fluids. You get too close, they grab you, teeth or fingernails break skin, and that's it. Which meant that if you stayed behind walls and didn't let them touch you, you were safe. The walls were enough. The lock on the door was enough. Time was on your side because they were deteriorating and help was coming and as long as nobody got bit, everybody still inside their trailers was going to be fine.

I was about to watch that framework collapse in three minutes.

The Andersons lived four units from us, at the bend in the U where the drive curves. Terry and Lisa. He drove a delivery truck for a feed company. She worked the register at Family Dollar. They argued loudly enough that everyone in the park knew the shape of their marriage — the fights about money, the screen door banging when one of them walked out to cool down. My mom once told me, "People are doing their best, Nate. Sometimes their best is loud."

Terry had left yesterday. I'd heard the argument through the walls — not the words, just the geometry of it, the rising and falling tones that meant one wanted to go and one wanted to stay — and then his truck pulling out, fast, down the drive and onto Highway 21. He hadn't come back.

Lisa came out at 10 AM on Sunday morning. She was on the phone — I could see her lips moving, her free hand gesturing the way people gesture when they're arguing with someone who can't see them. She was pacing the small concrete pad in front of her door, three steps one way, three steps back, the phone pressed to her ear.

She was loud. Not screaming — just upset, the kind of loud that comes from fear and frustration and twenty-four hours of not knowing where your husband is.

Mr. Pembrook's head turned.

The two by the laundry building oriented.

I watched them begin to move — slow, steady, converging — and I felt something tighten in my throat and I pressed the binoculars harder against my face and I didn't look away.

---

What happened next took about three minutes. I need to describe it carefully because getting it wrong could kill you.

The three Turned walked toward Lisa Anderson's lot. They spread — one down the drive, two angling between trailers on either side. Geometry. They cut off the exits from her lot, which had three ways out: the drive in front, and the gaps between her trailer and the ones on either side. By the time Lisa noticed them, two of the three gaps were closed.

She noticed when Pembrook came around the corner of the trailer next to hers. He was maybe twenty feet away, still walking, still steady, bathrobe open, that smooth blank face pointed at her. She stopped pacing. She lowered the phone.

"Earl?" she said. That was Pembrook's first name. I didn't know that until she said it. "Earl, what are you — why aren't you wearing—"

Then Pembrook did something.

He smiled.

He smiled, but the smile was wrong. Too wide. Too many muscles, pulled back too far, showing too many teeth. Like a grin described to a thing that had never grinned before — all the mechanical components present but assembled by something that didn't understand what the expression meant. A lure. A thing shaped like reassurance that was the opposite of reassurance. The almost-rightness hit me through the binoculars like a physical force.

Lisa screamed.

She ran. Back through the gap that was still open, between her trailer and the empty unit behind it. She was in pajama pants and bare feet on gravel and she was running flat out, arms pumping, the phone flying out of her hand and skittering across the lot. The scream was continuous — not words, just the sound of a person whose fear has exceeded language.

The three Turned followed. Walking. Always walking. But more Turned were coming now — I could see them appearing between trailers, drawn by the scream. Two from the far end of the park. One from Highway 21. They materialized the way background characters appear in a game when you trigger an event — suddenly present, as if they'd been waiting in the render distance.

Lisa ran down the narrow strip of dead grass between the back row of trailers and the chain-link fence that separated the park from the tree line. She ran toward the dumpster enclosure at the end, and for a second I thought she'd go over the fence — it was four feet, chain-link, she could have climbed it — but there were two more on the other side. They'd come through the woods. The underbrush was thick enough to hide them and they'd been there — waiting or drawn by the noise — and now they were standing at the fence line, and the fence was not going to help.

Lisa stopped. She was in the corner of the park — dumpster enclosure on one side, fence on the other, six Turned closing from the drive side. No exit. She pressed her back against the dumpster enclosure and she was screaming and her bare feet were on cold gravel and I was standing at my window watching through binoculars and I could not help her and I knew I could not help her and I did not try.

I wasn't frozen. The calculation was instant: I was fifteen, a hundred and eighty pounds, couldn't run fifty yards without wheezing, six of them and one of me, forty feet of open gravel. If I opened my door I would die the same way she was about to die.

The math said I couldn't help. The math was right. But the math also meant I didn't have to try, and I was already good at not-trying. I was a fat kid who couldn't run. I couldn't help. The logic was clean and I could stand behind it like a locked door.

The Turned closed in. Not fast. Patient. The ones in front wore that grin — that wrong, wide, too-many-teeth grin that flickered across their faces like a signal, like a welcome sign in a language nobody alive spoke. The closer they got, the wider the grins got, and Lisa was shaking, her whole body vibrating, and the screaming had turned to a high, thin sound that wasn't screaming anymore — something more animal than that — and then—

She stopped.

Stopped being what she was. It happened in her face first — a slackening, a smoothing, as if a hand had wiped her features clean. Then the tension went out of her shoulders, her hands unclenched, her spine straightened. Her breathing went slow and even.

And then the grin.

It spread across Lisa Anderson's face the same way it had spread across Pembrook's — too wide, too many teeth. It lasted maybe thirty seconds. Her eyes wide and fixed, her mouth stretched into something that looked like ecstasy if you'd never seen ecstasy. Then it faded. The grin receded to a flat line, then past it, to nothing.

Lisa Anderson straightened up. As I watched, her hand drifted to the collar of her pajama top and tugged — a small, absent gesture, the way you'd loosen a tie that was too tight. The top slid off one shoulder. She didn't fix it. She walked — calmly, steadily, barefoot on the gravel — to where the nearest group of Turned was standing. She joined them. They reoriented. They faced the drive. After a minute the others drifted back to their positions, and the park was still again, and Lisa Anderson was standing in a lot in pajama pants and bare feet and the phone she'd dropped was still lying in the gravel by her front door, screen cracked.

It rang.

The screen lit up. I could see it from my window — the bright rectangle on the grey gravel, buzzing, insistent. Terry calling back. Terry, an hour away in Fort Smith or broken down on the highway or already gone, calling his wife's phone because she'd been on the line with him when she screamed and the call dropped and he was trying to reach her and she was standing fifteen feet from the phone and she would never answer it again.

It rang four times. Then it stopped. Then it rang again.

I put the binoculars down because my hands were shaking. I pressed my palms flat against my thighs and breathed. I wanted to go out there and answer it and tell him — tell him what? "Your wife is gone, she's standing right here but she's gone"? I couldn't go out there. And I was angry — at the phone for ringing, at Terry for calling, at the uselessness of a phone call in a world where the person you're calling isn't the person you're calling anymore.

The phone stopped ringing. The screen went dark. Nobody picked it up.

The grin. The smoothing. The blank.

I would see it too many times. But the first time taught me what I was looking at: a recruitment. Something inviting people in, and the invitation looked like a smile, and the cost was everything you were.

Nobody touched her. Nobody bit her. Nobody scratched her or bled on her or breathed on her. They just scared her enough, and the fear did the rest. Every zombie movie I'd ever seen was wrong. The walls didn't matter. The locks didn't matter. The thing that got you wasn't on the other side of the door. It was inside your own body, waiting for the right chemical signal.

---

I closed the blinds.

I sat on the floor of the bathroom — smallest room, no windows — with my back against the tub and my knees pulled up and breathed.

Here is what I knew: Pembrook was one of them. Lisa Anderson was one of them now too. She'd been fine until she wasn't, and the thing that changed her was running, screaming, being afraid. The Turned hadn't caught her. They'd *made* her afraid, and the fear itself was what changed her. The people who didn't panic — Ricky Sims drove out fast but he was angry-fast, not scared-fast, and he made it. Pembrook had been standing in his lot for a full day and nobody bothered him — because he was already one of them, but the principle was the same. Calm equaled safe. Panic equaled gone.

And here is the other thing I knew, the thing that sat heavier: they ate. They drank. They foraged through garbage and tore tomatoes off vines and drank from garden hoses. They were not dying. They were not winding down. They were maintaining themselves with the mechanical persistence of something that intended to still be here tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. Whatever this was, it wasn't a spasm. It wasn't a fever that would break. It was a new steady state, and the things outside my window were settling into it the way water settles into a basin — filling every available space, finding equilibrium, and staying.

You couldn't wait this out. The movie was over — the one where you barricade and hold and the National Guard shows up on Day Five. These things weren't deteriorating. The walls were irrelevant when the mechanism was your own adrenaline. And the cavalry was probably standing in a parking lot somewhere with blank faces, because the thing that turns you is the thing soldiers are trained to produce.

And my mom — my mom who ran toward emergencies, who spent twelve hours in the loudest, most fear-saturated room in the county — my mom was almost certainly standing somewhere too. I could see it now. The ER filling up, the confusion, the screaming, the patients who weren't patients anymore, and her in the middle of it doing her job because that's what she does, and her heart rate climbing because that's what hearts do, and the line — whatever the line was — approaching. I could see it and I couldn't unsee it and I hated every frame.

But I didn't know. I hadn't seen it. And "probably" is not "definitely," and the crack between those two words was the only thing keeping me on the floor of a bathroom instead of somewhere worse. She was smart. She was calm under pressure in a way that four years of night-shift ER had built into her. Maybe that held. I didn't believe it. I held onto it anyway.

One data point on the fear mechanism. Multiple observations on the biology. You can't draw a conclusion from one data point. But it was the start of a pattern I would spend the next six weeks filling in — wrong, then less wrong, then less wrong again.

I didn't go outside. I tried 911. I got a recording — "Due to an extremely high call volume, all operators are currently assisting other callers. Please remain on the line" — and I waited eight minutes and nobody came on. I hung up and tried again and waited eleven minutes and nobody came on. The dispatchers were either gone or triaging a crisis so far beyond one scared kid in a trailer park that my call was at the bottom of a list nobody was ever going to finish.

Outside, through the bathroom wall — you can hear everything through these walls, that's the thing about trailers, they don't keep secrets — I could hear footsteps on gravel. Slow, even, unhurried. Walking past my unit and then away and then back and then away. Not searching. Just present. Maintaining coverage, the way units in a game maintain a zone of control.

At one point the footsteps paused near my unit, and I heard a different sound — a metallic scraping, then a tearing, then chewing. One of them had found something to eat. It ate for about a minute, standing in the gravel three feet from my bathroom wall, and then moved on.

Somewhere past Highway 21, in the direction of the subdivisions down toward town, a single rifle shot. Then nothing.

At some point — I don't know when, the dark doesn't have hours — I must have slipped under, because I was in the hospital. Not visiting. Working. I was wearing my mom's scrubs and they fit, which was wrong, and I was walking the hallway toward the ER and the fluorescents were buzzing the way fluorescents do and everything was fine. Mom was at the nurses' station. She looked up and said "Happy Friday, bud" and I said "It's Sunday" and she said "No, honey, it's always Friday now" and smiled, and the smile was too wide, and I was awake.

My heart was slamming. I could feel it in my throat, in my wrists, behind my eyes. I pressed my hand flat against my chest and counted — not breaths, heartbeats. One hundred and twelve, one hundred and eight, one hundred and four. I counted them down the way you'd count down a launch sequence, because somewhere in the part of my brain that was still working I understood that my heart rate was the thing that could kill me now, that the fear wasn't just fear anymore, it was a mechanism, and the mechanism was running, and I had to shut it down manually because the automatic systems had stopped being trustworthy.

Ninety-six. Eighty-eight. Eighty-two.

I sat there with my hand on my chest until the number felt safe, whatever safe meant, and I did not let myself close my eyes again.

I sat in the bathroom in the dark and I listened and I did not sleep and the trailer settled around me — the creaks and pops of a metal box cooling in the October night — and every sound was both familiar and alien, because this was my home and also it wasn't anymore, because home requires a person and the person wasn't here, and what was here instead was just a fifteen-year-old and some thin walls and the knowledge that the thin walls were the only thing between him and a thing that grinned when it was hungry and ate when it was done.
