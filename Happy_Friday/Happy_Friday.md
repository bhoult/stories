# ACT ONE: INERTIA

# Chapter 1: The Sick Day

Here is a fact about me: I am fifteen years old, I weigh approximately one hundred and eighty pounds, and on the night the world ended I was six hours into a *Civilization VI* marathon as Gilgamesh of Sumeria because his War-Cart is overpowered in the Ancient Era and I needed something in my life to go well.

I was home sick. I was not sick.

I'd told my mom my stomach hurt, which she didn't believe because she's an ER nurse and can spot a fake symptom the way a mechanic can spot a bad alternator. She put her hand on my forehead, already knowing I was lying, decided the fight wasn't worth it, and left me a Sprite and a sleeve of Saltines on the counter. "I'm on at six. There's leftover pasta in the fridge. Don't stay up all night."

"I won't," I said, which we both knew was a lie but a small enough one that it didn't matter.

She left at 5:45 because she's always early. Night shift at Johnson Regional — four years now, Friday through Monday, twelve hours, because the differential pay is better and because, she says, "somebody has to be there when normal people are sleeping." We live in a single-wide in Shady Oaks Mobile Home Park off Highway 21, north of town toward the national forest. The night differential is the difference between a single-wide and sleeping in her car. She comes home smelling like hand sanitizer and talks about her patients in words I only half understand. Triage. Bolus. Lactated Ringer's.

At the door she did the thing she always does on Fridays. She turned back and pointed at me — just pointed, a little acknowledgment of our routine — and said, "Happy Friday, bud."

"Happy Friday," I said, not looking up from my screen.

She left.

I've replayed that moment more times than I've replayed anything in my life. I was on the couch. Laptop open. Half-eaten bag of Doritos on the cushion next to me, orange dust on the trackpad. My mom said "Happy Friday, bud" and I said "Happy Friday" and I didn't look up.

I didn't look up.

That's not the important part of the story. But it's the part I can't stop thinking about.

By 11 PM I'd pushed past the Medieval Era and was working on a domination victory — conquer everybody. It's all positioning and logistics and knowing when to push and when to consolidate. I'm going to be explaining a lot of things in detail going forward and you should probably get used to it.

The trailer was quiet the way it always is on Friday nights — just me and the furnace and the thin walls. I could hear Mr. Pembrook's TV two units down, the occasional car on Highway 21, and the dogs at the far end of the park who bark at everything.

Our trailer is a 1998 Fleetwood, two bedroom, one bath, with wood-grain paneling that hasn't been wood-grain since Clinton was president and a kitchen where the counter is eighteen inches from the stove. The lot is gravel. The skirting is vinyl. The walls are charitably insulated — you can hear your neighbor sneeze but at least you can't feel the wind.

I'm describing this because later the geography of this park — seventeen occupied units in a U-shape off a gravel drive, community laundry building at the entrance, dumpster enclosure at the back, Highway 21 on one side and a wooded hillside on the other — becomes the most important map I ever study. I need you to see it now, while it's still just a place where people live cheap and keep to themselves.

At 11:14 PM I heard sirens. Multiple. Not the single wail of an ambulance heading to Johnson Regional, which is basically white noise here — Highway 64 is the ambulance corridor and we're close enough to hear it. This was layered. Three, four vehicles from different directions, overlapping, close and then far and then close again. I paused the game because the sound was interfering with my concentration, which tells you everything you need to know about my priorities at that moment.

My phone buzzed. AP News notification:

**PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DECLARED IN MULTIPLE STATES — Details developing**

I opened it. The article was three facts and twelve paragraphs of nothing — something about "unexplained behavioral episodes," the CDC "coordinating with state health departments," citizens advised to shelter in place. The rest was filler. "Experts are monitoring the situation." "The White House released a statement expressing concern." Journalist code for: we know as much as you do, which is nothing, but we have to keep typing or they'll make us go outside.

I turned on the TV, which I should have done first, and which I'm telling you about second because I want to be honest about the order in which I processed the end of the world: phone, then Reddit, then television, because I am a child of my generation and the TV is my mom's thing and I literally had to look for the remote for three minutes before I found it under a couch cushion.

Local news was running continuous coverage, which sounds dramatic but mostly meant two anchors sitting at a desk looking increasingly uncomfortable while repeating the same five facts in different arrangements. Schools closed in the morning. The hospital was on diversion — no new patients. The National Guard had been activated, which they illustrated with stock footage of Humvees that could have been from any year. Between repetitions, they cut to reporters in other cities — Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles — all saying the same thing: something is happening, it's happening everywhere, nobody knows what it is.

One segment from a station in Dallas showed cell phone footage of a man in a Walmart parking lot eating raw ground beef out of the package, standing upright, methodical, his face blank. The anchors cut away from it quickly. Nobody commented on it. It was just one more piece of the montage of wrongness, and at the time I didn't realize it was the most important thing they'd shown all night.

The global scope was the only real news, and it was staggering if you stopped to think about it. I didn't. At fifteen, "worldwide" is a word on a map. Three blocks is where you live.

I switched to Reddit. The front page was already a disaster. A megathread on r/all — "What is happening? Reports of mass behavioral changes worldwide" — had 30,000 upvotes and climbing. I scrolled. It was the same report over and over: *My neighbor is standing in his yard and won't respond. There are people outside who aren't moving. I saw someone get chased and then they just stopped and joined them.* Identical accounts from Portland and Houston and London and Lagos, ten thousand variations on the same three sentences.

A few posts were different — stranger, harder to process. Someone in rural Oregon described affected individuals "gathering around a cattle trough and drinking from it like animals." A woman in suburban Atlanta posted that the man standing in her cul-de-sac had walked to her bird feeder, pulled out the seed tray, and eaten the contents, then gone back to standing. A man in rural Kentucky wrote that an affected person had broken through his kitchen window at 3 AM — not stumbled into it, not walked through an open door, but punched through the glass and climbed in over the sink and eaten everything in the refrigerator and then left through the same window. "It wasn't random," he wrote. "It was like it was looking for something." This one was downvoted. People didn't want it. It didn't fit the standing-still narrative, the passive narrative, the "just avoid them and they leave you alone" narrative that everyone was building because that narrative was the comfortable one. I scrolled past it too. I shouldn't have.

The conspiracy theories were growing like mold. In the first two hundred comments I counted: Chinese bioweapon, Russian bioweapon, 5G activation, Bill Gates depopulation agenda, punishment from God for gay marriage, punishment from God for not allowing gay marriage, nanobots in the water supply, leaked government experiment, mass formation psychosis, aliens, something about immigrants, something about Elon Musk, and — this one I remember because it was all caps — "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LET THEM TAKE THE GUNS." Everyone was explaining the thing they didn't understand by blaming the people they already hated. Nobody was describing what was actually happening because nobody knew what was actually happening, so they described their fears instead and called it information.

This is what people do when the world stops making sense: they fill it in with whatever was already in their heads. A blank coloring book, everyone with their own crayons.

I wasn't any different. I had my own coloring book and my own crayons, and they were all labeled with things I'd absorbed from movies and games and late-night Wikipedia spirals. Some kind of virus, I figured. A fast-acting neurological thing — prion disease, maybe, or a weaponized pathogen. The affected people were sick. They were confused. They'd be disoriented for a while and then the CDC would figure it out and there'd be a vaccine or a treatment and the news cycle would move on. That was my framework: this is a medical emergency, it's scary but temporary, the adults with the degrees and the hazmat suits will handle it. Shelter in place meant wait it out. The system was overwhelmed but the system was still there.

I held onto that framework for about thirty-six more hours. It was wrong in every particular, but it was comfortable, and comfort is the thing you give up last.

I didn't find anything useful. I went back to my game.

Twenty minutes later I heard gunshots.

Not close — maybe a mile, maybe more, past Highway 21 toward the interstate. But distinct: the flat crack of a handgun, rapid, five or six shots. Then nothing. Then, from a different direction, more — a heavier sound, a rifle, three deliberate pops. In Arkansas you hear guns. Hunting season, target practice, someone shooting a copperhead in their yard. It's background noise. But this wasn't the right pattern. Hunting rifles are spaced — one shot, pause, one shot. Target practice is rhythmic. This was urgent. This was someone shooting at something they were afraid of, which is a different sound entirely, and I knew the difference even though I'd never consciously thought about it before.

My brain went straight to the movies. Barricade the doors. Find weapons. Head for the roof. Shoot anything that shuffles. That's the playbook for this, right? That's what you do when the sick people start walking around and the government says shelter in place. You board up and hold out and eventually the National Guard rolls in with Humvees and bullhorns. I'd seen this movie. Everybody's seen this movie.

The dogs at the end of the park were going insane. Barking, howling, the frantic kind that means something is wrong in a way that dogs understand and people pretend not to.

I paused the game. I went to the kitchen window. Our trailer faces the gravel drive, and from the kitchen I can see past the laundry building to Highway 21. The road was empty. The streetlight at the park entrance was on, throwing its orange cone across the asphalt. Nothing was moving.

The gunshots didn't repeat. The dogs eventually stopped — not wound down, not tapered off. Stopped. All of them, within a few seconds of each other, mid-bark, as if something had arrived at their end of the park that was worse than whatever they'd been barking at.

The silence after was a different kind of silence. The hair on my arms stood up — all of it, at once — and my stomach turned over slow and heavy. I stood at the kitchen window and didn't move and barely breathed. I couldn't have told you what I was afraid of. But my body knew.

I went back to the couch.

On my desk, under the Doritos bag, was last month's issue of *Popular Science*. Cover story: Comet Voss and the unusually bright meteor showers it produced when Earth passed through the edge of its tail in September. I'd read the article during a 2 AM Wikipedia rabbit hole — one of those where you start with "what's the fastest animal" and end up reading about the Oort Cloud and panspermia, which is the theory that life on Earth might have originally arrived on comets and meteoroids. A legitimate scientific hypothesis with real evidence behind it. I thought the comet article was cool. I mentioned it to exactly no one. I had already forgotten about it.

I should not have forgotten about it.

But that comes later. Right now it's 2 AM on a Saturday morning in October in Arkansas, and I'm falling asleep on a couch with a laptop on my chest and a mouth that tastes like Doritos, and outside, past the gravel lot and the dark tree line, the world is quietly ending, and I don't know yet.

# Chapter 2: The View from the Window

I woke up because the laptop was overheating on my chest and the fan was making a noise like a small animal dying. The screen had gone to sleep. The game was paused. Sunlight was coming through the living room blinds in those horizontal stripes that mean mid-morning, and I lay there for a minute in that groggy state where you know you fell asleep somewhere you weren't supposed to, and my first thought was: *Mom's going to be annoyed about the couch.*

My second thought was: *Mom's not here.*

I sat up. The trailer had that specific quality it gets when no one else has been in it for a while — still. But it was more than that: the trailer felt wrong. My mom's presence is what makes this place a home instead of a metal box. Her coffee mug on the counter. Her reading glasses on the arm of the chair. All of those things were still there, but they were artifacts now — evidence of a person who should be here and wasn't.

The Sprite she'd left me was warm on the counter. The Saltines were still in their sleeve, lined up neat next to the Sprite because that's how she does things — she arranges. She lines things up for me before she goes. I looked at them sitting there and something behind my ribs contracted, and I had to look away.

She should be here. That was the whole thought. A kid standing in a kitchen at 9:42 in the morning understanding that "should" doesn't mean anything anymore.

Her keys weren't on the hook by the door.

She should have been home by seven. It was 9:42.

I called her. Straight to voicemail. Her voicemail message is the one she recorded four years ago, and she says her name wrong — "You've reached Delia Carver" — except she stumbles on "Carver" because she'd only had the name back for six months after the divorce and it still felt new in her mouth. I've heard this voicemail probably three hundred times. I never mentioned the stumble.

I called again. Voicemail.

I texted: **u ok? still at work?**

I put the phone down and went to the kitchen. Cereal. Frosted Mini-Wheats, same box as last night. I ate standing at the counter because I didn't want to go back to the couch — the couch was where Last Night Nate lived and I needed to be the version of myself who eats breakfast at the counter like a functioning person.

---

The TV was still on from last night, muted. I unmuted it.

Local news, continuous coverage. The morning team looked like they'd been called in early and hadn't had time to do whatever it is anchors do to their faces. Same loop: schools closed, shelter in place, National Guard activated, hospitals on diversion. But the scope had changed overnight. The ticker scrolled cities: New York, London, Tokyo, Mumbai, São Paulo, Lagos, Berlin, Sydney. The news was handling this the way news always handles things it doesn't understand: reporting on how much of it there was instead of what it was.

"The crisis has now been reported in over forty countries." Great. What crisis? "Authorities worldwide are urging calm." Wonderful. Calm about what?

They cut to a reporter standing in front of a hospital in Little Rock. Behind her, the parking lot was full and there were people milling around the entrance in a way that looked wrong but that I couldn't articulate yet. She was saying something about "overwhelmed emergency departments" and "unprecedented patient volume" and then the camera shifted slightly and in the background, behind a parked ambulance, I saw two people standing perfectly still while everyone else moved around them. They were facing the camera. They weren't blinking. The reporter didn't notice them. The camera cut away.

I stood there with my cereal and watched the TV and had the feeling you get when you're playing a game and you've just uncovered a section of the map and the fog of war has pulled back and what's underneath is worse than what you imagined, but also somehow less dramatic — not a massed army, just a landscape that's subtly, fundamentally wrong.

---

From the kitchen window I could see across the gravel drive to the other units. The park was quiet. Not peaceful-quiet — held-breath-quiet. The kind of quiet where the absence of sound is itself a pressure in your ears.

Mr. Pembrook was standing in his lot.

Mr. Pembrook lived three units down, a retired mail carrier, sixty-something, drank Busch Light on his steps and had opinions about the park management that he shared with anyone who came within range. My mom called him "harmless" in a tone that meant she'd considered the alternatives. Every morning he came out in his green terrycloth bathrobe — the one that was missing the belt — to get his mail or just stand there with a cigarette and squint at the sky like he was deciding whether to approve of the weather.

He was wearing the bathrobe now. Nothing else — just the robe, open, no shirt, no undershirt, nothing beneath it. He was standing in the gravel between his trailer and the next one, in the sunniest part of the lot — the one spot where the morning light came between the two units without shadow. I want to be clear about this because it mattered and I noticed: Mr. Pembrook was standing outside in October with his bathrobe hanging open and he was completely exposed, and it was not something he would ever have done — not because he was modest but because Mr. Pembrook was a man with a very specific sense of what was and wasn't acceptable in a public space. Standing naked in the lot was not acceptable. The fact that he was doing it anyway meant that the part of him that knew the difference was gone.

He was just standing there. Not getting his mail. Not smoking. Both hands at his sides. Facing the drive. Not moving. The bathrobe flapped a little in the breeze and he didn't reach for it.

I watched him for maybe a minute, chewing cereal, waiting for him to do something. He didn't do anything. My first thought was that he was sick — whatever was overwhelming the hospital had gotten to Pembrook. Some kind of neurological thing, a fugue state, maybe a stroke. He'd stand there for a while and then he'd snap out of it or collapse, and when the ambulances started running again someone would take him to Johnson Regional and they'd figure out what was wrong. That was the frame I put around it: a sick old man in a bathrobe. Temporary. Fixable.

But there was evidence around him that he'd done something during the night. The spigot on the side of his trailer was dripping — not broken-dripping, turned-on-and-not-quite-closed dripping. There was a wet streak on the gravel below it. And his garbage can, which had been upright by his steps yesterday, was on its side, the bag torn open, contents scattered. It could have been raccoons. We got raccoons sometimes. But the bag wasn't shredded the way raccoons shred things — it was pulled open from the top, the way a person would open it, and some of the contents were missing and others were spread across the gravel as if someone had sorted through them. I noticed this. I didn't understand it yet.

The lot across from his: empty. The Garcias' truck was gone — they'd left, or they were already at work when it started, or something else. Two units down from Pembrook, Mrs. Watts's door was closed, curtains drawn. Sienna Okafor's place, two lots over from ours: porch light on, no movement. The laundry building at the park entrance: door ajar, lights off. Highway 21 beyond it: nothing.

I stood at the window and catalogued all of this without knowing I was cataloguing it. In *Civ*, the beginning of every playthrough is the same: you have one settler, one warrior, and a circle of visible terrain surrounded by fog of war. Everything outside that circle is unknown. The first thing you do — always, before you build, before you commit to anything — is remove the fog. You explore. You figure out what's around you. Because committing before you understand the map is how you lose the game in fifty turns.

I wasn't consciously applying this. I was eating cereal and looking out a window. But part of me was already doing it: noting anomalies, filing them, building a picture from fragments the way I always do when I'm paying attention. The fog was pulling back, and what was underneath was very wrong, and I was the only one looking.

My lower back was killing me. I'd been standing at the window for over an hour, which doesn't sound like much except that I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds and my body is not designed for sustained anything — not standing, not walking, not sitting in one position. I shifted. I leaned against the counter.

I needed to pee but I didn't want to leave the window — leaving meant losing data, and the bathroom has no window, and being in a room where I couldn't see outside had become terrifying. I held it for another twenty minutes and then gave up because biology beats strategy every time. Forty-five seconds in the bathroom and my heart was hammering the whole time. When I got back to the window nothing had changed, but the relief was physical. I hated that I needed a window this much already.

---

I tried my mom again at 10:15, 10:30, and 10:47. Voicemail, voicemail, voicemail. I texted twice more. I called Johnson Regional main line and got a recording: "Thank you for calling Johnson Regional Medical Center. Due to an unprecedented volume of patients, we are unable to take your call at this time. If this is a life-threatening emergency, please dial 911. Please do not come to the emergency department unless your condition requires immediate medical attention. We appreciate your patience during this difficult time." It was the most polite way I'd ever been told that the hospital was drowning.

I tried the internet again. It was still working — the infrastructure was fine, the cell towers and fiber optics didn't care about behavioral crises — but the content had gotten worse. The Reddit megathread had passed 100,000 comments and fractured into chaos. The useful observations were buried under an avalanche of panic and ideology. A commenter with a medical username had posted a detailed theory about prion disease and gotten two thousand upvotes and a hundred replies explaining why it was wrong. Someone was insisting it was the vaccine. Someone else was insisting it was the people who didn't get the vaccine. A long post about chemtrails had been gilded three times.

Someone had posted cell phone video from what looked like a suburb in Ohio — a woman being slowly surrounded by four people walking toward her in perfect synchronization — and the top comment was "obviously staged."

The news sites were worse. Not because the servers were failing but because the reporters had nothing new to say and were required to keep saying it. CNN had updated its main article six times. Each update was longer and less informative than the last, bulked out with quotes from officials saying "we're monitoring the situation" in increasingly creative ways. The pattern was global: same reports from every continent, same behavioral descriptions, same total absence of explanation. The world's entire information infrastructure was functioning perfectly, and the information it was transmitting was: *We don't know. We don't know. We don't know.*

I am not a person who panics. I want to be clear about this because I think people imagine that when something bad happens, everyone either panics or doesn't, and the people who don't are brave and the people who do are weak. That's not how it works. I didn't panic because panicking wasn't what my body wanted to do. My body wanted to sit and gather information and wait for the picture to clarify, because that's what my body always wants to do. I am built for observation the way some people are built for action. In normal life this looks like laziness. In a crisis it looks like something else.

But I was scared. I was scared the way you get scared when you're watching a loading bar stuck at 83% and you know something's wrong but you can't figure out what. My mom wasn't home. My mom was always home by seven.

And there was the thought I wasn't letting myself think. The one that sat at the edge of every other thought like a shadow you see in peripheral vision and refuse to turn toward. She worked the ER. She was in the building where the "unexplained behavioral episodes" would arrive first, carried in on stretchers, stumbling through the sliding doors. She was in the room where people were afraid, where the adrenaline was highest, where — I didn't have the mechanism yet, but I had the shape of it — whatever was happening to people would happen fastest.

She was probably one of them. The math said so. An ER nurse on the night it started, in the building that was already on diversion before midnight. Probably.

But probably isn't certainly. And I held onto that gap — the space between "probably" and "definitely" — the way you hold onto a ledge when you can feel your fingers slipping. She could have gotten out. She could have locked herself in a supply closet. She was smart and she was calm and she'd spent four years managing emergencies in that building and she knew every exit and every closet and every room with a lock. She could have made it. I didn't believe she had. But I hadn't seen her turn, and until I saw it, the door stayed open. A crack. Enough to breathe through.

I tried her one more time. Voicemail.

---

At 2:15 my phone buzzed hard — an emergency alert, the kind that overrides Do Not Disturb and makes that sound that always makes me flinch:

**EMERGENCY ALERT: Shelter in place. Lock all doors and windows. Avoid contact with individuals displaying altered behavior. Do NOT approach. Do NOT attempt to restrain.**

I checked the locks. Front door — locked, already locked, Mom always locks it. Back door — locked. The windows were the cheap crank kind that barely sealed when they were closed; I cranked them tight. I closed the blinds in the bedroom and bathroom. In the living room I left them cracked just enough to see the drive.

I sat on the couch. The TV was still running its loop. Mr. Pembrook was still in his lot. The afternoon light was going flat and grey.

Then I noticed something that made my stomach clench. One of the two strangers by the laundry building had drifted closer. Not toward me specifically — toward this end of the park, toward the row of trailers where mine was. And I thought about what I'd been observing all day: how they oriented toward sound, how their heads tracked noise. The TV had been on for hours. It wasn't loud — my mom kept the volume low because the walls are thin and she was considerate about that — but it was the only sound in the park besides the wind and the occasional creak of siding. In this silence, even a low murmur of newscasters carried.

I turned it off. The click of the power button was the loudest thing in the trailer. The screen went dark and the silence rushed in like water filling a hole, and I sat there in the quiet and felt the absence of the one thing that had been connecting me to a world where people still talked and explained and tried to make sense of things. The TV had been a tether. Cutting it was the first time I chose the world outside the window over the world I wanted to still be living in.

The stranger by the laundry building stopped drifting. After a few minutes she turned and walked back toward the entrance. I couldn't prove causation. But I didn't turn the TV on again.

And the trailer was doing the thing again — the wrongness that had nothing to do with the Turned and everything to do with absence. My mom should have been asleep in her bedroom by now, blackout curtains drawn, white noise machine running. Instead: nobody to be quiet for. Her bedroom door was open and the bed was made — she'd made it Friday morning before her shift and no one had touched it since. It looked like a display bed. A bed nobody sleeps in.

I was fifteen years old and alone in a trailer and the world outside was broken and the world inside was empty. Old enough to understand what was happening. Not old enough to do anything about it.

---

The afternoon passed. The TV stopped looping and started getting worse.

By 2 PM the local anchors were gone — replaced by a national feed pulling in footage from everywhere. Most of it was the same: empty streets, Turned standing in clusters, the eerie synchronization of their movements. But some of it was different, and the different stuff was what stuck.

A traffic camera in Houston showed a group of Turned gathered around a fire hydrant that had been knocked open — one of them crouching, face in the stream of water, drinking. Not cupping their hands. Not bending to a fountain. Drinking the way an animal drinks, face-down, sustained. The anchor talked over it without mentioning it, as if the footage was just B-roll and the drinking wasn't the point. A news helicopter in Phoenix filmed what appeared to be Turned inside a grocery store — visible through the shattered front windows, moving between aisles, pulling things off shelves and consuming them standing up. The helicopter footage ran for maybe forty seconds before they cut away to an expert panel that had nothing to say.

I was watching. I was building a picture I didn't want to see. They drank. They ate. They were not statues. They were not frozen. They were something. Organisms. Things with needs. The standing, the stillness, the blank faces — that was their resting state, their default. But they had other states. They got thirsty. They got hungry. They maintained themselves.

Mr. Pembrook had moved. Not far — he'd drifted about ten feet from his previous position and was now closer to the spigot on the side of his trailer. As I watched, he reached out and turned the handle. Water ran. He bent to it, put his mouth to the stream, and drank for about fifteen seconds. Then he turned the handle back — not all the way, leaving it dripping — and returned to his position. The whole sequence was mechanical, purposeful, utterly without the self-consciousness that a human being would bring to the act of drinking from a garden hose in their front yard in an open bathrobe. He needed water. He got water. He went back to waiting.

I'd been telling myself they were deteriorating. Confused, disoriented, running on fumes — they'd wander around for a day or two and then collapse, and the CDC or whoever would come through and clean it up. That was the comfortable version. The version where this was a medical crisis with a timeline and an ending.

The woman eating green tomatoes off the vine killed that version. This was the moment I understood, without having the language for it yet, that these things were not going to just stop. They were not going to stand there until they fell over. They were taking care of themselves, the way any living thing takes care of itself, and whatever was running them had figured out — already, within the first twenty-four hours — how to keep the machinery going.

I ate Frosted Mini-Wheats and monitored the drive through the blinds and thought about this.

At some point in the afternoon I heard more gunshots — closer this time, maybe half a mile, the direction of the subdivisions down toward Highway 64. A burst of rapid handgun fire, then a gap, then two heavier rifle shots, then shouting that I could hear but not understand, and then nothing. The dogs at the far end of the park had been silent all day. They hadn't barked since last night, when they'd all stopped at once. I didn't see any dogs in the park. I didn't see any dogs anywhere. I tried not to think about what that meant.

At 7 PM, with the light almost gone, I checked the news one more time. The FEMA website had posted an updated advisory:

**SHELTER IN PLACE. Lock all doors and windows. Avoid contact with individuals displaying altered behavior. Do NOT approach. Do NOT attempt to restrain. Avoid strenuous physical activity and high-stress situations. Remain calm.**

*Avoid strenuous physical activity and high-stress situations.* I read that three times. Why would FEMA care about your stress level? In a fire you run. In a tornado you take cover. In a flood you get to high ground. Physical activity keeps you alive in every other emergency. Why was this one different?

I didn't figure it out that night. But I remembered it. And remembering it, later, kept me alive.

The movie in my head was still running — the one where you board up, hold out, and the cavalry arrives. But the movie was starting to skip. In the movie, FEMA tells you to shelter in place because help is coming. They don't tell you to manage your stress level. In the movie, the sick people shamble and deteriorate and fall down eventually. They don't eat from gardens and drink from hoses and sort through garbage with the efficiency of someone who plans to be here next week. The movie was wrong. I didn't know how wrong yet.

I ate the leftover pasta cold, standing at the kitchen counter in the dark. My mom's recipe — garlic, tomatoes, the cheap pasta from Dollar General that she insists tastes the same as the expensive kind. She's right. It tasted like Tuesday. Three days ago. A different century.

I washed the fork and put it in the drying rack because that's what she does.

# Chapter 3: The Thing Mr. Pembrook Did

Sunday. Day two. I didn't turn the TV on. I'd killed it yesterday after realizing the sound was drawing attention, and in the dark hours of the morning the memory of that drifting stranger — the one who'd been walking toward my end of the park while the newscasters murmured — was enough to keep my hand off the remote. Instead I checked my phone, volume at zero, brightness low.

The coverage had changed. The news sites had shifted from "we don't know what's happening" to "here is more of what's happening and we still don't know why." The scope was confirmed: every continent, every major city, the same phenomenon. The details were getting stranger. A BBC article described Turned in London entering a Tesco through broken windows and consuming food directly off the shelves. A wire service report from Japan mentioned groups of Turned standing knee-deep in rivers, faces down, drinking. An Australian outlet, with clinical understatement, reported that Turned in rural Queensland were killing and consuming livestock in ways described as "methodical."

The FEMA site had posted a new advisory at 4 AM. The crawl read: **AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS RETAIN BASIC BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. DO NOT ASSUME THEY WILL BECOME INCAPACITATED WITHOUT INTERVENTION. CONTINUE TO SHELTER IN PLACE.**

*Do not assume they will become incapacitated.* I read that three times. It meant: don't wait for them to fall over. It meant someone at FEMA had realized what I was starting to realize — that these things were eating and drinking and maintaining themselves, and waiting them out was not a plan.

I'd slept in my mom's bed. Her room is at the back of the trailer, away from the drive, with the one window that faces the wooded hillside where nobody goes. I took her pillow because it smelled like her shampoo — the coconut kind from Dollar General — and that was sentimental and I'm not going to apologize for it.

The trailer was worse in the morning. Not structurally worse — the same thin walls, the same vinyl floor, the same countertop with the burn mark from when I put a hot pan down without a trivet and she didn't yell at me, just looked at the mark and sighed and said, "Well, now it has character." All of that was still there. But the systems that made it a home were unwinding. The coffee maker hadn't run because nobody set it. The bathroom smelled like my soap, not hers. Her reading glasses were on the arm of the chair at the exact angle she'd left them, and they would stay at that angle forever now, or until I moved them, and either option felt like a violation.

The trailer was becoming a museum of Friday, October 24th — the last day someone lived here instead of just surviving here — and every unchanged object was a timestamp marking the moment the world split.

I ate cereal. I went to the window.

Mr. Pembrook was in the same spot. I don't mean he'd gone inside and come back out. I mean he had been standing in the gravel between his unit and the next one, in his open bathrobe, in the same position, for what was now approaching twenty hours. A human being does not stand in one place for twenty hours. I knew this. My brain tagged it and filed it in the box where I was keeping things that didn't make sense yet.

The park had changed overnight. Two more figures had appeared — strangers, nobody I recognized, standing near the laundry building at the park entrance. Same posture as Pembrook: still, hands at sides, facing inward. They'd come from Highway 21, maybe, drawn to the park the way water is drawn to low ground. Three of them now, spaced across the park in a triangle that I didn't recognize as geometry yet but that some part of my brain was already noting.

I had my mom's bird-watching binoculars. She'd bought them three years ago during a brief and unsuccessful attempt to develop a hobby that wasn't work. They were good binoculars — 10x42, the kind that pull in a lot of light — and through them I could see details.

Mr. Pembrook's face. I focused on it for a full minute, looking for something I couldn't name. And I found it, though I didn't understand what I was finding. His expression was smooth. Neutral in a way that human faces don't naturally achieve — we always carry something, even at rest. Pembrook's face carried nothing. Everything in the right place, nothing behind it.

The two by the laundry building had the same quality. I panned the binoculars across their faces and felt something cold move through my chest. The feeling you get when you realize the AI has been making moves you didn't see, and the board is not what you thought it was.

One other thing. All three of them — Pembrook and the two strangers — were facing the same direction. East. Toward the morning sun. Their faces were tilted up slightly, like people at a beach, and the sunlight was falling directly on their skin. As I watched over the next hour, they shifted. Not their positions — their orientation. As the sun moved, they turned with it. Not dramatically, not all at once. Just a slow, collective reorientation, like sunflowers on a time-lapse.

I wrote this down in my notebook: *They face the sun. Don't know why.* I still don't know why. But Dr. Moss, when I eventually told her about it, put her pen down and stared at me for a long time and then said, "How early did you notice that?" and when I said "Day two," she said something under her breath that I think was "Jesus Christ" but might have been something else.

I was removing the fog of war. I didn't like what was underneath.

I panned the binoculars across the park. Slow. Methodical. Taking inventory.

One of the strangers by the laundry building had moved. Not far — she'd drifted maybe twenty feet toward the Garcias' empty trailer, and she was crouched. Not sitting. Crouched, the way you'd crouch to look at something on the ground. I focused.

She was eating.

The Garcias had a garden — a small one, three raised beds along the side of their unit, tomatoes and peppers mostly, the kind of thing you grow when you're trying to save money on groceries. The plants were still producing in late October, the last ragged tomatoes hanging on the vine. The woman was pulling them off and eating them whole — not biting, not chewing with any apparent process, just putting them into her mouth and working her jaw. Green ones, ripe ones, it didn't matter. She ate methodically, without pleasure or haste, the way a machine processes fuel. When the tomatoes were gone she moved to the pepper plants and ate those too. Then she stood up, turned, and walked back to her position near the laundry building. Resumed standing. The whole thing had taken about four minutes.

But the way she'd moved to the garden was different from Pembrook's drift. She'd approached low, almost crouching, with the directness of a predator approaching a food source. Something purposeful, acquisitive. And her shoes — she'd been wearing shoes at the laundry building. Now they were off, placed neatly on the curb, side by side. The neatness was worse than the barefoot.

They weren't statues. They were organisms with needs. They ate, they drank, and between the eating and drinking they stood in their positions and waited. Waited for us.

The fact that they ate was the part that scared me most. A thing that eats plans to keep going. A thing that plans to keep going is not going to stop.

At approximately 8 AM, Ricky Sims three lots over started his truck.

Ricky was mid-twenties, worked at the Tyson plant, drove a black F-150 with a Confederate flag sticker on the tailgate that my mom said she "chose not to have feelings about." He came out his front door moving fast, keys in one hand, a duffel bag in the other. He threw the bag in the bed, got in, and cranked the engine. The truck roared to life and the sound was enormous in the silence — the first mechanical noise I'd heard since I turned the TV off.

All three Turned moved at once.

Not toward Ricky — toward the sound. Their heads swiveled in unison, smooth, tracking, the way a security camera follows motion. Then they began walking. Toward the truck. Not fast. The same steady, unhurried pace — maybe two miles an hour — that I would come to understand was their default when unstimulated. They conserve. They don't waste movement.

Ricky saw them. He did what Ricky would do: he revved the engine, threw it in reverse, and peeled out of his lot in a spray of gravel. The truck fishtailed on the drive, straightened, and blew past the laundry building toward Highway 21. The two by the entrance didn't try to block him. They turned their heads and watched him go.

He made it. He was gone. The three Turned stood in the positions they'd drifted to during their walk toward the noise, and after about a minute they drifted back to their original spots, like balloons returning to rest after a breeze.

I stored this: they oriented toward noise. They moved toward it. They didn't pursue a fast-moving target. They returned to positions afterward.

One more thing from that sequence. When the truck engine roared, before the Turned started walking, Pembrook's face changed. I had the binoculars on him and I saw it: a grin. Not a smile — a *grin*, sudden and wide and wrong, too many teeth, the corners of his mouth pulled back further than a mouth should go. It lasted maybe five seconds, from the moment the engine noise spiked to the moment Ricky's truck was already accelerating away. Then it faded — smoothed back to the blank, the neutral, the nothing. It happened fast enough that I almost convinced myself I'd imagined it. I hadn't imagined it. I would see that grin again, much closer, much worse, in about two hours.

The next two hours were quiet. I watched the park through the binoculars and scrolled my phone between observations. The news sites were updating less frequently now — fewer reporters, fewer updates, the same information reshuffled — but social media was still churning. A video from Chicago had gone viral overnight: a group of Turned moving through what looked like an open-air market, pulling food from stalls, eating standing up. One of them carried a whole watermelon under its arm for about thirty seconds, then stopped, smashed it on the pavement, and crouched over the pieces. The video was forty seconds long and had eleven million views and the top comment was just "what the fuck" with two hundred thousand upvotes, which was about right.

In the park, Mr. Pembrook had moved to the dumpster enclosure and was going through the communal garbage. I watched through the binoculars as he pulled out a trash bag, tore it open with both hands, and sorted through the contents. He ate something — I couldn't tell what, the angle was wrong — and discarded the rest.

In the morning light, with the binoculars at full magnification, I noticed something about his skin that I hadn't seen the day before. On his face and forearms — the sun-exposed skin — there was a faint discoloration. Not bruising. Not sunburn. More like a stain under the surface, a dull greenish-grey that I might have mistaken for a trick of the light except that it was only on the parts of him that had been facing the sun. I didn't know what to do with that information so I wrote it down in my notebook and drew a circle around it, which is what I do when something seems important but I can't explain why. It didn't mean anything to me yet. It meant something to Dr. Moss, later, and what it meant was the worst news anyone had ever received, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

He walked back to his lot, that steady two-mile-an-hour pace, and resumed standing. The two by the laundry building hadn't moved.

They were on Day Two of existing, and they'd already figured out garbage.

At around 10 AM, Lisa Anderson came out of her trailer.

---

I was still operating on the zombie-movie framework. The one thing I thought I knew — the one thing every movie agrees on — is how it spreads: contact. Bites. Scratches. Bodily fluids. You get too close, they grab you, teeth or fingernails break skin, and that's it. Which meant that if you stayed behind walls and didn't let them touch you, you were safe. The walls were enough. The lock on the door was enough. Time was on your side because they were deteriorating and help was coming and as long as nobody got bit, everybody still inside their trailers was going to be fine.

I was about to watch that framework collapse in three minutes.

The Andersons lived four units from us, at the bend in the U where the drive curves. Terry and Lisa. He drove a delivery truck for a feed company. She worked the register at Family Dollar. They argued loudly enough that everyone in the park knew the shape of their marriage — the fights about money, the screen door banging when one of them walked out to cool down. My mom once told me, "People are doing their best, Nate. Sometimes their best is loud."

Terry had left yesterday. I'd heard the argument through the walls — not the words, just the geometry of it, the rising and falling tones that meant one wanted to go and one wanted to stay — and then his truck pulling out, fast, down the drive and onto Highway 21. He hadn't come back.

Lisa came out at 10 AM on Sunday morning. She was on the phone — I could see her lips moving, her free hand gesturing the way people gesture when they're arguing with someone who can't see them. She was pacing the small concrete pad in front of her door, three steps one way, three steps back, the phone pressed to her ear.

She was loud. Not screaming — just upset, the kind of loud that comes from fear and frustration and twenty-four hours of not knowing where your husband is.

Mr. Pembrook's head turned.

The two by the laundry building oriented.

I watched them begin to move — slow, steady, converging — and I felt something tighten in my throat and I pressed the binoculars harder against my face and I didn't look away.

---

What happened next took about three minutes. I need to describe it carefully because getting it wrong could kill you.

The three Turned walked toward Lisa Anderson's lot. They spread — one down the drive, two angling between trailers on either side. Geometry. They cut off the exits from her lot, which had three ways out: the drive in front, and the gaps between her trailer and the ones on either side. By the time Lisa noticed them, two of the three gaps were closed.

She noticed when Pembrook came around the corner of the trailer next to hers. He was maybe twenty feet away, still walking, still steady, bathrobe open, that smooth blank face pointed at her. She stopped pacing. She lowered the phone.

"Earl?" she said. That was Pembrook's first name. I didn't know that until she said it. "Earl, what are you — why aren't you wearing—"

Then Pembrook did something.

He smiled.

He smiled, but the smile was wrong. Too wide. Too many muscles, pulled back too far, showing too many teeth. Like a grin described to a thing that had never grinned before — all the mechanical components present but assembled by something that didn't understand what the expression meant. A lure. A thing shaped like reassurance that was the opposite of reassurance. The almost-rightness hit me through the binoculars like a physical force.

Lisa screamed.

She ran. Back through the gap that was still open, between her trailer and the empty unit behind it. She was in pajama pants and bare feet on gravel and she was running flat out, arms pumping, the phone flying out of her hand and skittering across the lot. The scream was continuous — not words, just the sound of a person whose fear has exceeded language.

The three Turned followed. Walking. Always walking. But more Turned were coming now — I could see them appearing between trailers, drawn by the scream. Two from the far end of the park. One from Highway 21. They materialized the way background characters appear in a game when you trigger an event — suddenly present, as if they'd been waiting in the render distance.

Lisa ran down the narrow strip of dead grass between the back row of trailers and the chain-link fence that separated the park from the tree line. She ran toward the dumpster enclosure at the end, and for a second I thought she'd go over the fence — it was four feet, chain-link, she could have climbed it — but there were two more on the other side. They'd come through the woods. The underbrush was thick enough to hide them and they'd been there — waiting or drawn by the noise — and now they were standing at the fence line, and the fence was not going to help.

Lisa stopped. She was in the corner of the park — dumpster enclosure on one side, fence on the other, six Turned closing from the drive side. No exit. She pressed her back against the dumpster enclosure and she was screaming and her bare feet were on cold gravel and I was standing at my window watching through binoculars and I could not help her and I knew I could not help her and I did not try.

I wasn't frozen. The calculation was instant: I was fifteen, a hundred and eighty pounds, couldn't run fifty yards without wheezing, six of them and one of me, forty feet of open gravel. If I opened my door I would die the same way she was about to die.

The math said I couldn't help. The math was right. But the math also meant I didn't have to try, and I was already good at not-trying. I was a fat kid who couldn't run. I couldn't help. The logic was clean and I could stand behind it like a locked door.

The Turned closed in. Not fast. Patient. The ones in front wore that grin — that wrong, wide, too-many-teeth grin that flickered across their faces like a signal, like a welcome sign in a language nobody alive spoke. The closer they got, the wider the grins got, and Lisa was shaking, her whole body vibrating, and the screaming had turned to a high, thin sound that wasn't screaming anymore — something more animal than that — and then—

She stopped.

Stopped being what she was. It happened in her face first — a slackening, a smoothing, as if a hand had wiped her features clean. Then the tension went out of her shoulders, her hands unclenched, her spine straightened. Her breathing went slow and even.

And then the grin.

It spread across Lisa Anderson's face the same way it had spread across Pembrook's — too wide, too many teeth. It lasted maybe thirty seconds. Her eyes wide and fixed, her mouth stretched into something that looked like ecstasy if you'd never seen ecstasy. Then it faded. The grin receded to a flat line, then past it, to nothing.

Lisa Anderson straightened up. As I watched, her hand drifted to the collar of her pajama top and tugged — a small, absent gesture, the way you'd loosen a tie that was too tight. The top slid off one shoulder. She didn't fix it. She walked — calmly, steadily, barefoot on the gravel — to where the nearest group of Turned was standing. She joined them. They reoriented. They faced the drive. After a minute the others drifted back to their positions, and the park was still again, and Lisa Anderson was standing in a lot in pajama pants and bare feet and the phone she'd dropped was still lying in the gravel by her front door, screen cracked.

It rang.

The screen lit up. I could see it from my window — the bright rectangle on the grey gravel, buzzing, insistent. Terry calling back. Terry, an hour away in Fort Smith or broken down on the highway or already gone, calling his wife's phone because she'd been on the line with him when she screamed and the call dropped and he was trying to reach her and she was standing fifteen feet from the phone and she would never answer it again.

It rang four times. Then it stopped. Then it rang again.

I put the binoculars down because my hands were shaking. I pressed my palms flat against my thighs and breathed. I wanted to go out there and answer it and tell him — tell him what? "Your wife is gone, she's standing right here but she's gone"? I couldn't go out there. And I was angry — at the phone for ringing, at Terry for calling, at the uselessness of a phone call in a world where the person you're calling isn't the person you're calling anymore.

The phone stopped ringing. The screen went dark. Nobody picked it up.

The grin. The smoothing. The blank.

I would see it too many times. But the first time taught me what I was looking at: a recruitment. Something inviting people in, and the invitation looked like a smile, and the cost was everything you were.

Nobody touched her. Nobody bit her. Nobody scratched her or bled on her or breathed on her. They just scared her enough, and the fear did the rest. Every zombie movie I'd ever seen was wrong. The walls didn't matter. The locks didn't matter. The thing that got you wasn't on the other side of the door. It was inside your own body, waiting for the right chemical signal.

---

I closed the blinds.

I sat on the floor of the bathroom — smallest room, no windows — with my back against the tub and my knees pulled up and breathed.

Here is what I knew: Pembrook was one of them. Lisa Anderson was one of them now too. She'd been fine until she wasn't, and the thing that changed her was running, screaming, being afraid. The Turned hadn't caught her. They'd *made* her afraid, and the fear itself was what changed her. The people who didn't panic — Ricky Sims drove out fast but he was angry-fast, not scared-fast, and he made it. Pembrook had been standing in his lot for a full day and nobody bothered him — because he was already one of them, but the principle was the same. Calm equaled safe. Panic equaled gone.

And here is the other thing I knew, the thing that sat heavier: they ate. They drank. They foraged through garbage and tore tomatoes off vines and drank from garden hoses. They were not dying. They were not winding down. They were maintaining themselves with the mechanical persistence of something that intended to still be here tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. Whatever this was, it wasn't a spasm. It wasn't a fever that would break. It was a new steady state, and the things outside my window were settling into it the way water settles into a basin — filling every available space, finding equilibrium, and staying.

You couldn't wait this out. The movie was over — the one where you barricade and hold and the National Guard shows up on Day Five. These things weren't deteriorating. The walls were irrelevant when the mechanism was your own adrenaline. And the cavalry was probably standing in a parking lot somewhere with blank faces, because the thing that turns you is the thing soldiers are trained to produce.

And my mom — my mom who ran toward emergencies, who spent twelve hours in the loudest, most fear-saturated room in the county — my mom was almost certainly standing somewhere too. I could see it now. The ER filling up, the confusion, the screaming, the patients who weren't patients anymore, and her in the middle of it doing her job because that's what she does, and her heart rate climbing because that's what hearts do, and the line — whatever the line was — approaching. I could see it and I couldn't unsee it and I hated every frame.

But I didn't know. I hadn't seen it. And "probably" is not "definitely," and the crack between those two words was the only thing keeping me on the floor of a bathroom instead of somewhere worse. She was smart. She was calm under pressure in a way that four years of night-shift ER had built into her. Maybe that held. I didn't believe it. I held onto it anyway.

One data point on the fear mechanism. Multiple observations on the biology. You can't draw a conclusion from one data point. But it was the start of a pattern I would spend the next six weeks filling in — wrong, then less wrong, then less wrong again.

I didn't go outside. I tried 911. I got a recording — "Due to an extremely high call volume, all operators are currently assisting other callers. Please remain on the line" — and I waited eight minutes and nobody came on. I hung up and tried again and waited eleven minutes and nobody came on. The dispatchers were either gone or triaging a crisis so far beyond one scared kid in a trailer park that my call was at the bottom of a list nobody was ever going to finish.

Outside, through the bathroom wall — you can hear everything through these walls, that's the thing about trailers, they don't keep secrets — I could hear footsteps on gravel. Slow, even, unhurried. Walking past my unit and then away and then back and then away. Not searching. Just present. Maintaining coverage, the way units in a game maintain a zone of control.

At one point the footsteps paused near my unit, and I heard a different sound — a metallic scraping, then a tearing, then chewing. One of them had found something to eat. It ate for about a minute, standing in the gravel three feet from my bathroom wall, and then moved on.

Somewhere past Highway 21, in the direction of the subdivisions down toward town, a single rifle shot. Then nothing.

At some point — I don't know when, the dark doesn't have hours — I must have slipped under, because I was in the hospital. Not visiting. Working. I was wearing my mom's scrubs and they fit, which was wrong, and I was walking the hallway toward the ER and the fluorescents were buzzing the way fluorescents do and everything was fine. Mom was at the nurses' station. She looked up and said "Happy Friday, bud" and I said "It's Sunday" and she said "No, honey, it's always Friday now" and smiled, and the smile was too wide, and I was awake.

My heart was slamming. I could feel it in my throat, in my wrists, behind my eyes. I pressed my hand flat against my chest and counted — not breaths, heartbeats. One hundred and twelve, one hundred and eight, one hundred and four. I counted them down the way you'd count down a launch sequence, because somewhere in the part of my brain that was still working I understood that my heart rate was the thing that could kill me now, that the fear wasn't just fear anymore, it was a mechanism, and the mechanism was running, and I had to shut it down manually because the automatic systems had stopped being trustworthy.

Ninety-six. Eighty-eight. Eighty-two.

I sat there with my hand on my chest until the number felt safe, whatever safe meant, and I did not let myself close my eyes again.

I sat in the bathroom in the dark and I listened and I did not sleep and the trailer settled around me — the creaks and pops of a metal box cooling in the October night — and every sound was both familiar and alien, because this was my home and also it wasn't anymore, because home requires a person and the person wasn't here, and what was here instead was just a fifteen-year-old and some thin walls and the knowledge that the thin walls were the only thing between him and a thing that grinned when it was hungry and ate when it was done.


# Chapter 4: The Knock

I spent the afternoon reading my mom's nursing textbook.

My mom kept two textbooks from her associate's degree on a shelf above the washer-dryer unit: *Fundamentals of Nursing* and *Brunner & Suddarth's Medical-Surgical Nursing*, which is the size and weight of a cinder block. She'd never gotten rid of them because, she said, "Nursing school was the hardest thing I ever did and those books are my trophies." I'd never opened them.

By Day 2 my phone was dead, the TV was off, I'd read every magazine in the house, and the textbooks were there. I pulled *Brunner & Suddarth* off the shelf and started reading about the autonomic nervous system because the alternative was sitting in the dark replaying the sound of Lisa Anderson screaming.

I didn't understand half of it. I understood enough. The sympathetic nervous system ran on chemicals: epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol. Produced by the adrenal glands in response to perceived threat. The system was involuntary — you didn't choose to activate it any more than you chose to digest food. I read about beta-blockers. I read about the feedback loop between the amygdala and the hypothalamus — the cycle where fear triggers chemicals that trigger more fear.

---

That night I learned the worst thing about them.

It was dark. I was in the hallway with *Brunner & Suddarth* open on the floor beside me and a flashlight I wasn't using because light is visible through thin walls.

The knock came at 10:47 PM. Three knocks. Front door. Polite.

"Nate? Honey? Your mama asked me to check on you."

Lisa Anderson's exact voice — the nasal quality, the stretched vowel in "mama." I had watched her turn six hours ago. Whatever was on the porch was using her voice the way you'd use a key against a lock.

"Nate, are you in there? I brought you some dinner."

The details were right. Lisa knew my mom worked at the hospital. Lisa had actually brought us food before. The organism had access to her memory and was selecting the approach most likely to trigger my response. Familiar voices activate the brain's reward pathways before the cortex can evaluate them. It wasn't trying to fool my thinking brain. It was reaching for the layer underneath.

Knowing this did not help.

Then it stopped. Ten seconds of silence.

When it came back, it wasn't Lisa's anymore.

"Nate? Baby? It's Mom. I'm home."

---

I put my hand over my mouth and bit down hard enough to leave marks. The sound trying to come out of me would have carried through the walls.

"I got off early. The roads were bad but I made it. Open the door, bud."

It was perfect. The warmth. The tiredness underneath. The pause before "bud."

"I brought Chick-fil-A. Come on, open up."

She doesn't bring Chick-fil-A. She brings Whataburger. Mom turns left out of the Johnson Regional Medical Center parking lot, passes the Taco Bell, and a mile down hits the Whataburger. Patty melt with jalapeños and a Dr Pepper. Every time. The closest Chick-fil-A is twenty-five minutes away in Russellville — Lisa Anderson's commute, not Mom's. Lisa drove to Russellville for work. The organism was using Lisa's neural architecture to puppet Mom's voice, and Lisa's brain associated "bringing dinner home" with the Chick-fil-A she passed every day on 64. The organism didn't know the difference. It grabbed the strongest food-plus-homecoming association it could find and it grabbed the wrong woman's.

The only reason I didn't open the door was a fast food restaurant. The margin between surviving and not was the difference between a Whataburger and a Chick-fil-A. I am alive because an alien organism used the wrong woman's memory of a drive-through.

"Happy Friday, bud."

Her exact voice. The inflection that rises on "Friday" and falls on "bud." I cried without making a sound. The thing on the porch said it again — "Happy Friday, bud" — and again — like a record skipping. It didn't understand that the reason the key fit was the same reason the door would never open.

Forty-five minutes. 10:47 to 11:32.

I sat for another hour. Then I washed my hand. The bite was deep — human mouths are bacterial ecosystems, infection rate above 10%. *Brunner & Suddarth*, chapter on wound management. My mom would have cleaned it properly. She would have said "Nate, honestly" in that exasperated voice, and fixed it.

I wrote in the notebook:

*She used Mom's voice. They access memories. The mimicry is targeted — the stimulus most likely to provoke a response. It's not cruelty. It's optimization. They find the thing you miss most and they put it on the other side of a door.*

*I miss her so much I can't breathe and the thing that used her voice knows that.*

I did not sleep. My brain had the Knock on a loop and the loop had no off switch. Forty-five minutes of audio playing behind my eyes every time I closed them. Lisa's voice. Then Mom's voice. "Happy Friday, bud." Over and over. I tried to think about something else and my mind returned to the loop the way a compass needle returns to north.

Around 3 AM I realized the loop itself was dangerous. Each replay spiked cortisol — chronic stress activation. The organism didn't need to scare me all at once. It could do it in installments. The Knock wasn't just an attempt to get me to open the door. It was a seed planted in a brain that couldn't stop replaying. My brain was doing its work for it, for free, in the dark.

I pressed my palms against my eyes and counted backward from a hundred by sevens. A cognitive interrupt — the kind of task that forces the prefrontal cortex to override the amygdala. It worked, partly. The loop dimmed to background noise. It didn't stop.

# Chapter 5: The Playlist

Day three. Monday. I was supposed to be in Mrs. Tillman's class making a poster about the Louisiana Purchase with Braden Cooke. The thought arrived absurd and complete, like a receipt from a country that doesn't exist anymore.

My hand was swollen where I'd bitten it. Red-streaked, hot to the touch. I cleaned it with dish soap and wrapped it in a clean sock. *Brunner & Suddarth* said untreated bite wounds progress to cellulitis in 24-48 hours. I needed antibiotics. I needed a world that still had pharmacies.

I ate cold SpaghettiOs from the can and read more of the textbook. My hand throbbed. The fever made the words swim if I read too long, so I read in bursts — ten minutes on, ten minutes staring at the ceiling.

I kept coming back to the window. Seventeen occupied lots in the park. Some of those people were still alive — I'd seen curtains move, heard a toilet flush through the thin walls. Each of us hiding alone. Each of us running out of food alone. Each of us watching alone.

There's a concept in game theory called the prisoner's dilemma — I know about it from a 2 AM Wikipedia binge. Two prisoners, each deciding independently whether to cooperate or defect. If both cooperate, both get a decent outcome. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector walks free and the cooperator gets the worst result. If both defect, both get a penalty.

The math is ugly. In a single round, the only rational move is to defect. Whatever the other player does, you're better off betraying. This is why it's a dilemma — rationality leads to a worse outcome than trust would. The thing that changes the math is repetition. In an *iterated* prisoner's dilemma — the same players, over and over — cooperation becomes viable because the future matters. The winning strategy is called tit-for-tat: cooperate first, then mirror whatever the other player does, and forgive quickly. Trust built on repetition. The long game rewarding the risk of the first move.

I was living inside the dilemma. Seventeen lots, seventeen prisoners, each making the calculation: risk contact or stay safe alone? In a single round — one encounter with a stranger — defecting is rational. But this wasn't a single round. We were all going to be here tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that, and the people who cooperated early would build the networks that kept them alive later, and the people who stayed hidden would run out of food and medicine and watch-hours and die rational and alone.

I couldn't solve it from the inside. I wrote it in the notebook and put a star next to it and the star didn't help.

---

I watched the park. The Turned had multiplied — eleven now, some familiar, some drifted in from Highway 21. They stood in a pattern that covered the exits: drive, gaps between trailers, the route to the road. A net.

Two of the newer arrivals moved differently from the originals. Pembrook and Lisa stood like statues — patient, still, conserving. These two were restless. They drifted between trailers with their heads moving, scanning, the posture of something searching for something specific. One of them stopped at the dumpster enclosure and pulled the lid up and went through it with a focus that wasn't the idle foraging I'd seen from Pembrook. This was directed. Purpose-driven. The body language of an organism running low on something it needed. I wrote it down and put a question mark next to it: *Different mode? Some of them are hungrier than others, or something else is driving the behavior.*

I started the list. At the top of a new page: **PLAYLIST.** Not because it was a playlist but because naming things makes them manageable.

Column one: name. Column two: what they were doing when they turned. Column three: behavior after.

Most entries said "unknown" in column two. I'd only witnessed one turning directly. But the pattern was there: everyone who turned was afraid. Everyone unafraid was untouched. Pastor Jim across Highway 21 walked between his house and the church every day and nothing happened to him. The variable wasn't location. It was something about the quality of his movement.

The textbook had given me the vocabulary. The observations had given me the pattern. What I didn't have was the threshold — the line between safe and gone. And I couldn't get it from a window.

---

Part of me was still waiting. I knew the bite theory was wrong. I knew they ate and maintained and weren't going to collapse. I knew the fear mechanism was the key. But underneath all of that there was still a fifteen-year-old kid who believed the adults were going to fix this. Somewhere out there, people with authority and resources were working the problem, and all I had to do was stay alive long enough. That was still the story. It was the last comfortable one I had.

I made my first mistake at 3:15 PM.

The laundry building had a flat roof with a maintenance ladder on the back. From up there I'd see the entire park — 360 degrees. Eighty feet of gravel between me and the ladder.

I watched the route for an hour. Two Turned visible, neither between me and the building. Clear path.

What I did not account for: a hundred and eighty pounds on gravel is not quiet.

Each step was a crunch. By twenty feet the Turned had oriented toward me. By thirty I saw a third one in the laundry building's shadow that I'd missed from the window. I should have turned back. I didn't, because I was fifteen and my ego was running my risk assessment.

I made it to the ladder. I was breathing hard — not the distance but the weight. My heart was hammering in my ears and I was sweating despite the cold. Three Turned were walking toward me. That steady two miles an hour. And they were making a sound — a low vibrating drone, resonant in the chest. A summoning call. *Come here. Something's happening.*

I ran. Gravel like gunshots under my feet. Knocked a propane tank — a clang like a bell. More of them appearing between trailers, drawn by the noise. I was a parade of panic, a hundred and eighty pounds of proof that the thing they respond to is exactly the thing I was producing.

I couldn't reach my trailer. Two between me and it. I veered toward Henderson's place, saw the gap between skirting and ground, and my body threw itself flat before my brain gave permission.

A hundred and eighty pounds of teenager diving for an eighteen-inch gap between vinyl skirting and gravel: the stomach hits first, because that's where the weight is. The impact compressed everything in my abdomen upward and I vomited — instantly, violently, the cold SpaghettiOs from six hours ago coming up in a hot rush across the dead leaves and my own forearms. I didn't stop moving. You can vomit and crawl simultaneously; I learned this the way I learn everything, by doing it wrong in real time. The skirting's raw edge caught my back as I scraped under — a vinyl lip with an aluminum rail behind it — and I felt it open the skin along my shoulder blade in a line that was either three inches or six inches long; I couldn't tell and it didn't matter because I was under the trailer and nothing else mattered.

---

Seven hours under Mr. Henderson's trailer.

Eighteen inches of clearance. Face in dead leaves and mud and my own vomit, which I'd crawled through and was now lying in. Can't roll over. Can't sit up. Every movement produced sound — the crinkle of leaves, the wet shift of mud, the scrape of my jacket against the trailer's underside. I learned to breathe without moving my chest, pulling air in shallow sips, because even the rise and fall of my ribs made the leaves rustle.

Through the lattice skirting I could see feet — bare, shoed, standing in a loose cluster. Four, then six, then more. The drone continued for the first hour, drawing them in.

At one point a face appeared at the gap in the skirting. Upside down. Someone bending to look. I pressed my face into the mud and stopped breathing and the face was there for ten seconds and then withdrew. They couldn't reach me. They didn't try to tear the skirting off. This was important data — in small numbers, they didn't dismantle structures. They herded, they waited, they applied pressure. But they didn't attack.

I stored this.

It got dark. Temperature dropped — low forties. Mud soaked through my clothes. I started shaking so hard my teeth rattled. Something wet was spreading across my back — the cut from the skirting, or condensation dripping from the trailer's underside, or both. I couldn't see it and I couldn't reach it and I couldn't tell if the warmth was blood or the cold was water and after a while I stopped trying to distinguish them. The ground under me was wet too — mud, certainly, but also something else, a sharper smell underneath the mud-smell, and I realized I was lying near what was probably a sewage line connection, and the wetness seeping through my shirt might be mud or might be something I was choosing not to name. My hand throbbed where I'd bitten it, the infection spreading its warmth into skin that was otherwise freezing, which was a horrible kind of irony — the only warm part of me was the part that was dying.

Sometime around hour three my thinking started to go sideways. Not panic — something quieter, more insidious. The cold and the dark and the immobility were doing something to my rational brain, loosening its grip. I started believing things I wanted to believe. Mom was fine — she'd locked herself in the supply closet at Johnson Regional, the one she'd pointed out to me once during a tour, the one with the deadbolt. She was in there right now with water and supplies and she was waiting for me. I was going to crawl out of here and walk home and she'd be there. The cavalry was coming. The National Guard was staging outside town, waiting for daylight. By morning there'd be Humvees on Highway 21 and people with bullhorns and someone would wrap me in a blanket. These weren't hopes. They were certainties — my brain manufacturing them with the same conviction it usually reserved for things I'd actually observed. The cold was killing my ability to tell the difference between what I wanted and what was real, and the things I wanted were flooding in through the gap.

I caught myself. Not completely — you can't completely override a hypothermic, terrified brain. But enough to recognize what was happening: my rationality was failing, and the failure felt like comfort, and the comfort was a trap. Your own mind offers you a story that feels better than the truth, and you take it because the truth is mud and cold and the sound of something chewing in the dark.

I held onto the data. The notebook entries. The observations. Pembrook's face. Lisa's scream. I held onto them like handholds and didn't let the comfortable lies wash them away.

But the cold did something I didn't expect. It killed the panic. As hypothermia crept in, the fear receded. Fear and cold compete for the same energy, and cold wins. By hour five my emotional range had narrowed to a single point: *survive this minute.* Just mud and cold and the need to keep shaking because shaking meant my body was still trying.

The Turned drifted away in ones and twos. By 2 AM the gravel was quiet.

I crawled out. My muscles had locked. Every movement was clarifying pain. My back burned where the skirting had cut me, and my arms were cross-hatched with scratches from the gravel and the lattice frame, and the vomit had dried in my hair and on my forearms. I walked back to my trailer — not ran, *walked* — through the gap between the dumpster enclosure and the back fence. The gravel crunched and I went slow enough that each step was a single small sound, and no heads turned.

Cold shower in the dark. The mud ran off in grey rivulets. The water over the cut on my back made me hiss through my teeth. Blood and dirt and things I didn't want to identify swirled down the drain. I sat on the shower floor and shook.

After, wrapped in every blanket I owned, sitting on the bathroom floor with *Brunner & Suddarth* open on my knees, I wrote:

**JOURNAL ENTRY #1:**

*Don't go somewhere you haven't watched first. Don't assume empty means empty. Don't assume your body can do things it can't.*

*But the real thing: when I was frozen and couldn't panic, they lost interest. When I walked slow in the dark, they ignored me. The state of my body is the variable. Not the location. Not the proximity. The body.*

*Brunner & Suddarth chapter 6: "The stress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis." The HPA axis. Three organs that decide whether you live or die based on chemical signals you can't consciously control. I am fifteen years old and I am alive because hypothermia accidentally suppressed my HPA axis. The textbook calls this "cold-induced sympatholytic effect." I call it the worst night of my life, and I learned more from it than from everything else combined.*

*My hand is bad. I need antibiotics. I need someone who knows what they're doing. I need Mom.*

# Chapter 6: Day Four, or How I Met Sienna

I woke on the bathroom floor with a dead arm and a fever. The bite on my hand was swollen, red-streaked, hot. Cellulitis — the textbook was right about the timeline. I cleaned it with dish soap and wrapped it in a fresh sock and thought about the word *sepsis* and decided not to think about the word *sepsis*.

I was at the kitchen window eating peanut butter from the jar when the back door opened.

No knock. No warning. The handle turned and a girl was standing in the doorway with her hands raised, palms out. She was tall, lean, dark-skinned, hair pulled back in a knot, wearing track pants and a CLARKSVILLE PANTHERS hoodie. Her eyes were wide and her breath was fast but controlled — scared, not panicking.

"Don't scream," she whispered.

I was holding a spatula. I had grabbed it instinctively when the door opened, because apparently my survival reflexes had the tactical sophistication of a line cook. I was standing in mud-stained clothes with a swollen hand wrapped in a sock and a fever and a spatula, and Sienna Okafor was looking at me, and I became aware — suddenly, devastatingly — that I looked ridiculous. Fundamentally ridiculous.

"You're Nate," she said. "Delia's kid."

"Yeah."

My voice cracked. I'm being honest about everything in this journal, so: my voice cracked when a girl spoke to me on Day 4 of the apocalypse, because puberty doesn't pause for the end of the world.

She came in and closed the door — quietly, pressing it shut so the latch didn't click. We looked at each other and neither of us knew what to say because there is no social protocol for meeting your neighbor during the extinction of the human species.

"How did you get here?"

"Between the skirting panels. There's a gap between your trailer and Mrs. Watts's — you can move between lots under the trailers. I've been watching you."

"Watching me?"

"Watching everybody. You're the only one who watches back."

---

Sienna Okafor was seventeen. She ran the 400 and 800 for Clarksville High — state finals good, scholarship-talk good. Her parents had driven to Oklahoma City to get her brother Jaylen on Friday night. They hadn't come back.

She'd done what I'd done: watched. But she'd watched with different eyes. She could read the Turned's gait — which ones had been athletes, which ones were new arrivals based on coordination changes. She saw transitions where I saw positions. We were the same instrument tuned to different frequencies.

She was also the most distractingly present person I had ever been in a room with. My brain, which had been functioning as a passable survival computer for four days, immediately downgraded to a calculator with a dead battery. She moved through my kitchen with the economy of someone who'd spent her life in motion and I kept losing my train of thought mid-sentence because she'd turn her head or shift her weight and some useless ancient part of my brain would say *hey notice this* and I'd forget what I was saying and have to start over and she'd look at me like she knew exactly what was happening and was choosing not to comment on it, which was worse.

I am fifteen. I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds. I have never been on a date or kissed anyone or had a conversation with a girl that lasted more than two minutes without me finding a reason to leave. There are monsters outside and my mother is missing and something I don't understand is turning people into blank-faced herding machines. None of it matters to the part of my brain that has noticed that Sienna Okafor has very nice collarbones. I would like that part of my brain to shut up. It will not shut up. I am going to ignore it and focus on survival and hope that nobody ever reads this paragraph.

---

She had supplies from a Dollar General run — first aid, batteries, canned food. And a blood pressure cuff from the pharmacy aisle, pink, with a cartoon heart on the display.

"If the body is the variable," she said — she'd been thinking along the same lines I had, independently — "then we need to measure it. Heart rate, blood pressure. Data."

"That's what I've been —"

"I know. I saw your notebook through the window. You're measuring the wrong things. You're tracking their positions. You should be tracking ours."

She was right. And she'd arrived at it faster than me from less information, which produced a feeling I recognized from game theory: discovering that your model of the board is incomplete. In the prisoner's dilemma, the first move is to cooperate. Sienna was my first cooperator. The smart play was obvious. It was also terrifying because cooperation meant proximity, and proximity meant she would see me clearly, and that was a threat that had nothing to do with the Turned.

"Your hand," she said.

"It's fine."

"It's not fine. It's infected. You need —"

"I know what I need. I read the textbook."

"Then you know you need antibiotics, not a sock."

She wasn't wrong about this either and I hated it.

---

We argued. About everything. She paced while we argued — three steps to the counter, three steps back, her hands adjusting things that didn't need adjusting, unable to have a disagreement while stationary. She wanted to leave — find help, the National Guard, anyone with a plan. I wanted to stay and understand.

"We can't just sit here," she said. "The food runs out, the power's failing, and there's eleven of them out there and the number is going up."

"We leave and we die faster. You saw what happened to —"

"I saw. I also saw Jim walking around like it's Sunday morning. Whatever keeps him safe, we need to figure it out, and we're not going to figure it out in your kitchen."

"I am figuring it out. The textbook —"

"You've been *hiding.* There's a difference."

That landed. I'd been on the wrong side of the line between observing and hiding for four days and calling it strategy.

But the landing didn't stick. I had a reflex for this — a well-practiced move that deflected the blow before it could bruise. I did it without thinking: *I'm a hundred and eighty pounds. I can't run. I'm fifteen. What am I supposed to do — waddle out there and reason with them?* The self-deprecation was instant and complete and it felt like honesty, because it *was* honest — I really was fat, I really couldn't run, I really was fifteen — and the fact that it was honest made it invisible as a defense. You can't argue with someone's accurate self-assessment. You can only watch them use it as a reason to stay still.

She saw it on my face and didn't apologize. I respected that even as I wanted to crawl under the sink.

"I want to go back to the highway interchange," she said. "The military blockade. There were vehicles, equipment —"

"There were forty dead soldiers."

"There were forty *Turned* soldiers. And the vehicles they came in. Radios. Weapons. Medical supplies. We need those things."

"The interchange is a concentration point. You said it yourself — the highways funnel —"

"I said the perimeter collapsed. I didn't say the equipment disappeared."

This was Sienna's blind spot, and I would see it again: she defaulted to action the way I defaulted to analysis. Her instinct when trapped was to move, and moving was the thing most likely to kill her. She knew this — she'd watched it kill soldiers. But her body was built for the 400-meter sprint, not for sitting in a kitchen with a fat kid arguing about risk assessment while the world ended outside.

"Not yet," I said. "Not until we know more."

"You always want to know more. At some point you have to *do* something with what you know."

"And if what I know is that doing something will get you killed?"

She went quiet. Her jaw tightened. I watched her process this — the runner's frustration at being told not to run — and for a moment I thought she'd leave, just walk out the back door and go to the interchange herself, because that was the kind of person she was, the kind who'd rather be wrong and in motion than right and still.

She didn't leave. She closed her eyes, breathed, and when she opened them the fury had been replaced by something harder and more deliberate.

"I know what I am," she said quietly. "The gun fires and you go. That's been my whole life — the starter's pistol, the first stride, everything after is just physics. And now the gun fires and going is the thing that kills you, and I have to unlearn fifteen years of training in a week." She looked at her hands. "I'm working on it. But it's like asking a fish not to swim."

"Tell me what you know," she said.

---

She told me about the soldiers. I wanted to hear this. Part of me — the part still clinging to the movie — needed to hear that the military was out there, that the blockade was holding, that the system was functioning somewhere even if it hadn't reached us yet. The National Guard at the interchange was proof that somebody with authority and firepower was handling this. That was the last thread of the old framework: the cavalry exists, even if the cavalry is late.

"Six Humvees, two trucks. They set up at the interchange. Floodlights, barriers. Maybe forty soldiers."

Her hands were on the counter. I noticed they were shaking. This wasn't analysis anymore. This was memory costing her something.

"They engaged. Short bursts, disciplined. The Turned kept coming — you can hit one and it flinches and keeps walking. But the shooting was turning the soldiers. One dropped his weapon and stood there. Then another. Then three more. The combat was spiking their stress past whatever the line is, and the more they fought, the faster they crossed it. Twenty minutes. Forty soldiers. Gone."

She paused. Looked at the counter.

"The last one — a sergeant — he stopped shooting. Just stood there. Watched them walk toward him. And they walked right past him. He'd stopped fighting and they lost interest."

I sat with this. The last thread snapped. Forty soldiers with training and weapons and discipline, and the weapons were worse than useless — the combat itself turned them. The cavalry wasn't late. The cavalry was already gone. Nobody was coming. The people most equipped to fight were the most vulnerable, because fighting was the trigger.

"That sergeant figured it out," I said. "Under fire, in real time, he figured out that fighting was the problem. That takes —" I didn't have a word for what that took. Something harder than courage. Abandoning every instinct you have in the moment when those instincts are loudest.

Sienna was quiet for a while. Then she said something that had nothing to do with soldiers.

"I can't sit still. You know that. I'm a runner. My whole life is about moving, about doing, about — and now the thing that kills people is the thing my body is built for. The activation, the adrenaline, the physical intensity. My strengths are all liabilities. Everything I'm good at is trying to kill me."

She said this without self-pity — factually, with irritation. But underneath it I recognized something I'd felt from the opposite direction: the vertigo of discovering that the person you've been is the wrong person for the world you're in.

"I know," I said. "My thing is the opposite. I've been sitting still my whole life. Never thought it would be the useful version of me."

"It's not," she said. "Sitting still keeps you alive. It doesn't keep anyone else alive. You need to move eventually. You just need to figure out how to move without dying."

This was the beginning of us. Not the way I wanted it to be, but the way that actually mattered: two people with opposite broken pieces figuring out that the breaks fit together.

I handed her the blood pressure cuff.

"Test yourself," I said.

She strapped it on. Heart rate: 82. Blood pressure: 126/80. Higher than mine. The athlete's resting rate should have been lower than the couch potato's, but stress heart rate and resting heart rate are different systems, and Sienna was carrying a weight I wasn't: Jaylen, her parents, the fury of a body caged.

"We need to get that down," I said.

"Don't tell me to calm down."

"I wasn't going to. I was going to say that Jim walks outside every day and nothing happens to him and he's seventy years old with a bad heart, which means he's on medication that does chemically what you're trying to do through willpower. If we can figure out what he's taking —"

She looked at me. The expression was complicated — frustration, respect, the look people get when they realize the quiet kid in Lot 7 has been paying attention to things they missed.

"So we need to talk to Jim," she said.

"We need to talk to Jim."

Outside, the sun was going down. The Turned shifted their positions in that slow collective turn — tracking the sunset the way sunflowers track the horizon. Lisa Anderson was among them, face smooth and tilted toward the orange light.

---

We stayed up long into the night. I'm not going to narrate the whole conversation because some things are worth more as memories than as transcripts, but I want you to know it happened.

I talked about my mom. Not the ER nurse on night shift during the outbreak, not the probability calculation I'd been running since Saturday morning. The version where she lines up Saltines next to a Sprite before she leaves. Where she stumbles over her own last name on a voicemail and I never mention it. I told Sienna about the fears I'd been carrying — that the world was going to stay like this, that the systems weren't coming back, that every strategy I could think of ended in a timeline I couldn't survive alone. I told her this because that is what a strategist does when the map runs out: he names the dark squares so they stop being infinite.

She talked about Jaylen. The dinosaur quizzes. How he'd correct her with this gravity that only seven-year-olds can pull off, like the relative size of a Giganotosaurus was the most important fact in the universe. She talked about her parents and the drive to Oklahoma City and how she'd told her mom to text when they got there and her mom hadn't texted. She talked about running — how the 400-meter was her event because it was the perfect distance, long enough to require strategy but short enough to require fury, and how everything she'd built her life around was now the thing most likely to kill her. She said this without self-pity, the same way she said everything, but her hands were wrapped around her mug and they were tight.

We drank Nesquik mixed with canned evaporated milk, because that was what was left in the cabinet and neither of us wanted water. It was too sweet and slightly gritty and we both drank it slowly, not because it was good but because drinking it slowly meant the conversation lasted longer, and the conversation was the first interruption in the isolation either of us had felt in days, and we were not ready for it to end.

I'm not going to tell you what time we finally stopped talking. When we did, the trailer was less empty than it had been since Friday, and that's worth recording even if I can't measure it.

She took the couch. I took the bathroom floor — my spot now, the place where the walls were closest and the dark felt managed. I lay there listening to the trailer settle and to the new sound layered over it: another person breathing.

Sometime after midnight I heard her twitch. A catch in her breath, then a sharp exhale, then the rustle of her shifting position. Then again, a few minutes later. A murmur that might have been "Jay" — the first syllable of a name she'd said seventeen times that evening. Her legs moved against the cushions, the runner's body running somewhere in the dark behind her eyes.

I lay on the bathroom floor and listened and didn't go to her and didn't call out. In the morning she said nothing about it. I didn't ask. We were both carrying things that came out only when consciousness stepped aside, and the unspoken agreement — already, on the first night — was that we would not name each other's ghosts.

Tomorrow we would cross Highway 21.


# Chapter 7: The Pattern

We crossed Highway 21 at 7:15 AM on a Tuesday in October, which is not a sentence I expected to describe as the bravest thing I'd ever done.

Sienna had lain on the couch with her shoes on and her eyes open, watching the ceiling, while I took the bathroom floor again because the bathroom was the room I'd claimed through repeated misery and at this point it felt like territory. I'd given her the blanket from my mom's bed. She didn't argue. Athletes know when to conserve.

I was wearing my only clean clothes — a pair of gym shorts and a Clarksville Panthers t-shirt two sizes too small that my mom had bought at a school fundraiser. Everything else I owned was in a garbage bag by the back door: the jeans and hoodie from the night under Henderson's trailer, still stiff with dried mud and vomit and whatever else had soaked into them from the ground. I'd tried to wash them in the sink. The stains faded but didn't leave. The smell faded but didn't leave. I threw them away eventually. Some things don't come clean.

Two hundred yards. My back door to Jim's church. In the old world, four minutes. We stood at the back door and breathed. Sienna counted — four in, hold four, out six — her voice doing more for my heart rate than any technique I'd read about. My hand throbbed in its sock bandage. The fever was low but present, a warmth behind my eyes that made everything slightly unreal.

"Ready?" she said.

"No."

"Good. Honest people live longer." She opened the door.

The park was quiet in the pre-dawn grey. Six Turned visible. Pembrook in his usual spot, face tilted toward the eastern horizon. The discoloration on his skin was darker than two days ago — the greyish-green spreading down his forearms. My first thought was decomposition — that the Turned were rotting on their feet and would eventually fall apart. The zombie-movie version. But Pembrook wasn't decaying. He was eating and drinking and sorting garbage with purpose. Whatever was happening to his skin was something else — changing, progressing toward something I couldn't identify.

We moved. Slow. Measured. Sienna moved better than I did — lighter, more coordinated, her feet finding the quieter spots between stones. I moved like what I was: a hundred and eighty pounds of anxiety impersonating nonchalance. Each crunch of gravel sent a jolt through me that I had to manually override, and at one point Sienna's hand touched my elbow — a brief pressure — and the spiral broke. I was focused on survival. I was thinking about gravel.

A Turned man in an open Carhartt jacket — bare chest catching the dawn light — took two steps toward us and stopped. Head cocked, like a dog hearing a frequency it can't place. Ten seconds. Then he turned away.

We reached Highway 21. Asphalt empty in both directions. Crossed. Past the church parking lot I could see the sign — hand-lettered on cardboard, propped in the side window, angled toward the road. Block letters in black marker:

**KEEP CALM. COME INSIDE. DON'T RUN.**

Jim had placed it to be visible from the road. He'd thought about the angle, the letter size, the window height — placed it the way you place a lighthouse, to catch people at the moment they most need direction. I don't know how many people that sign saved. I know it saved us, and I hadn't even consciously registered reading it from the trailer park until this moment, standing in the parking lot, seeing it from the intended distance.

The side door opened before we reached it. Jim Whittaker — big man gone thin, late sixties, white hair cropped military-short, flannel and khakis — held the door open and didn't speak until we were inside and the bolt was thrown.

"Delia's boy," he said. "And the Okafor girl. Took you long enough."

The bolt clicked home. The sound of a lock engaging had never meant more.

# Chapter 8: The Church of Whoever's Left

## ACT TWO: CONGREGATION
### *"Turns out the apocalypse is mostly committee meetings."*

---

Jim made coffee. The power was still on — barely — and he made it on the kitchen's electric burner and poured three cups and the smell of it was so ordinary that my knees went soft. Sienna took hers black. I took mine with enough sugar to qualify as dessert because I was fifteen and had the palate of a fifteen-year-old and I did not care that Sienna watched me dump three packets of sugar in and raised one eyebrow.

Jim sat across from us and studied our faces. He took his time. He was deciding how much to tell us.

"How did you get here?" he asked. Not the route. He meant: how did you survive?

I told him. The window. The watching. The pattern — everyone who panicked turned, everyone who stayed calm didn't. I told him about the textbook and the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenaline cascade. I talked too long. I always talk too long when I'm nervous and I was nervous because this was the first adult I'd spoken to in five days who was alive and sane and I wanted him to take me seriously.

Jim listened without interrupting. When I finished he nodded once, slowly, the way you nod when someone confirms something you already believed for different reasons.

"The Lord protects the peaceful," he said. "That's what I've been telling myself. The meek shall inherit the earth — I always read that as a promise about the afterlife. Turns out it might be operational advice."

He'd been watching the same pattern I had. The people who prayed, who sat still, who surrendered to something larger than their fear — they survived. The people who fought, who panicked, who trusted their own strength — they turned. Jim had framed it as theology. God's hand, sheltering the faithful. His conclusion was identical to mine: *stay calm, don't fight, don't flee.* His reasoning was completely different.

"Jim," I said. "What medications are you on?"

He set his mug down. "That's personal, son."

"It matters."

He looked at me the way adults look at you when you've asked a question that forces them to take you seriously — the slight recalibration, the moment where "kid" becomes "person." "Metoprolol. Fifty milligrams, twice a day. For my heart."

"It's a beta-blocker. It suppresses the sympathetic nervous system — the adrenaline response. That's why they don't bother you."

Jim picked up his coffee. Sipped it. Put it down.

"Those aren't mutually exclusive," he said. "The medication and the peace."

He was right in a way I was too smart to understand at the time. The metoprolol kept his body under the threshold. His faith kept his mind there. His faith had produced the sign in the window, which saved at least three lives. My correct understanding of the mechanism had produced a notebook.

I would learn, later, to hold both truths at once — Jim's theology and my pharmacology, both incomplete, both functional, pointing at the same survival behavior from opposite directions. Most people resolve contradictions by collapsing one side — picking the explanation that feels better and discarding the other. Jim didn't. He held "God protects the peaceful" and "metoprolol suppresses the HPA axis" in the same hand and didn't flinch. That capacity would turn out to be more important than either truth alone. The people who survived this world would be the ones who could let their assumptions and their observations coexist long enough for something useful to emerge from the friction.

But I didn't understand that yet. I just thought Jim was wrong for the right reasons. Wrong reasons, right answers. I would see this pattern until it broke me.

Jim watched me process this. Then he made his decision.

"There are others," he said. "Downstairs."

He'd opened his door to us, given us coffee, listened to our story — but he'd kept the others hidden until he was sure. I understood later what Jim had been doing, because I watched him do it again with Marcus. He had a system, unwritten but consistent.

First: he'd watched us cross the highway. The Turned hadn't reacted. That was the minimum — proof we were under threshold, still human enough that the organism wasn't interested. But that was necessary, not sufficient. Turned could mimic. The Knock had taught me that.

Second: the coffee. Jim made coffee for everyone who came through his door, and it wasn't hospitality — it was a test. He watched your hands. How you held the mug. How you adjusted your grip when the ceramic was too hot, the tiny unconscious corrections a living brain does without thinking. Turned could mimic speech with disturbing fidelity. But sustained fine motor behavior — the sipping, the way a person sets a mug down and picks it back up with a slightly different grip each time — was harder to fake. Jim watched our hands the way I watched the Turned through binoculars: looking for the thing that didn't fit.

Third: the conversation. Not the content — the duration. Turned could produce fragments, targeted phrases. But extended back-and-forth? Sustained dialogue with appropriate responses and emotional modulation? Jim talked to us for thirty minutes before showing us the basement. He was running a diagnostic.

I understood this. I would have done the same thing.

"Let me see your hand," said a voice from the stairwell.

Ruth Fenn was seventy-two years old and she came down the stairs the way she apparently did everything: with complete authority and zero patience. She was five-foot-two, white-haired, wearing a cardigan over a floral blouse, and she looked at me the way she'd looked at a thousand seventh-graders who'd come to class without their homework.

"I said let me see it."

I held out my hand. She unwrapped the sock — her nose wrinkled at the sock — and examined the bite with the clinical attention of someone who knew exactly what she was looking at. "Cellulitis. Early stage. You're running a fever."

"How do you —"

"I taught for thirty-nine years. Do you know how many children I sent to the nurse's office with infected cuts, ringworm, impetigo, and one memorable case of scabies? I can spot an infection from across a classroom." She turned to Jim. "Antibiotic ointment. First aid kit. And something that isn't a *sock.*"

She cleaned the wound with hydrogen peroxide from the church's first aid kit, applied antibiotic ointment, and bandaged it with actual gauze and medical tape, all while narrating what she was doing and correcting my grammar.

"You bit yourself? Deliberately?"

"To keep from making noise."

"Hm. Resourceful. Unsanitary. The word is 'bit,' not 'bited,' if you were wondering."

"I wasn't."

"You were about to be." She taped the gauze with the precision of a woman who had applied approximately ten thousand Band-Aids in her career. I noticed — because I notice things, it's what I do instead of being useful — that her hands were not quite steady. A slight tremor, controlled by decades of classroom discipline, but there. Ruth Fenn was afraid. The grammar corrections, the brisk authority — all of it was armor. She corrected grammar the way Dale carved wood: to keep her hands busy with something she could control while the world came apart around her. "Your mother is Delia Carver. I taught her. Mediocre student, excellent human being. She would be appalled by this bandage."

"She would."

"She'd also be proud of you. Don't let that go to your head." She patted the bandage once — firm, not gentle — and returned upstairs to the sanctuary where she was, Jim said, reading a romance novel and had been for two days.

---

The Sotos were in the basement.

I learned about Dale and Maria Soto in fragments, sideways, through the small behaviors that replace conversation when the context for normal conversation no longer exists.

Dale carved. He sat in a metal folding chair with a chunk of two-by-four and a folding knife and he carved constantly — small, precise strokes, wood shavings collecting at his feet like a second skin. I watched him for ten minutes before I realized he was making something specific: a beagle, ears down, in the posture of a dog waiting.

"I'm on Suboxone," he said, without looking up, because he'd caught me looking. "Maintenance. For opioid use disorder, which is the polite way of saying I was a junkie for six years and now I take a pill that keeps me level. My counselor said I was 'chemically balanced.' What she meant was my emotions don't spike. In normal life that's a problem." Stroke, stroke, curl of wood falling. "In this, it's the only reason I'm alive."

Maria was reorganizing the food pantry closet. She'd taken everything off the shelves, sorted it by category and expiration date, and was reloading it according to a system that made sense only to her. Ruth appeared at the bottom of the stairs and watched for a moment.

"Alphabetical would be more practical," Ruth said.

"Caloric density per unit of weight," Maria said, without turning around. "The heavy, low-calorie items go in the front. You eat those first while you're stationary. The light, high-calorie stuff goes in the back — that's what you grab if you have to move."

"That's not alphabetical."

"No. It's correct."

They stared at each other. Two women whose response to the end of the world was to organize whatever was in front of them, now locked in a silent territorial negotiation over a closet full of canned corn.

"I suppose," Ruth said, "that 'fewer calories' is at least grammatically sound."

Maria almost smiled. It was a small, bitter thing — the kind of smile that says *I see you and I don't have the energy to fight but I'm not conceding.* "I was an office manager for nine years. I organized a filing system for a law firm with eleven attorneys who all had different ideas about what 'alphabetical' meant. I can organize a food closet."

"I'm sure you can, dear." Ruth went back upstairs.

Maria finished the closet. I noticed she'd arranged it so the heavy items — canned vegetables, jars of sauce, the things with the most weight per calorie — were at the front and bottom, easy to reach, meant to be consumed first while we were sheltering in place. The light, calorie-dense items — jerky, nuts, protein bars, dried fruit — were in the back and on the top shelf, packed tight and ready to grab. If we had to leave in a hurry, you'd sweep the top shelf into a bag and go, and what you carried would be light and would keep you alive the longest. It was the organizational logic of someone who had already accepted that staying wasn't permanent.

"How long will this last?" I asked. Meaning the food.

"Sixteen days at current rationing. Twenty if we cut portions. Less if more people arrive." She said this the way you'd read a weather forecast — factual, without opinion.

"More people will arrive."

"Then less." She closed the closet. "That's how it works. Every person we help is a day we lose. I'm not saying don't help. I'm saying know the cost."

---

That first evening in the church, with the seven of us gathered in the basement by candlelight because the overhead fluorescents hummed at a frequency Jim worried carried through the walls, something happened that I didn't expect and don't have a clinical term for: we became people to each other.

Not all at once. In pieces. Ruth told a story about a student who'd brought a live frog to class in 1987 and how she'd confiscated it and kept it on her desk for the rest of the year and named it Fitzgerald. Dale showed us the beagle he was carving and said it was for his daughter, who was in Fayetteville, who he hadn't spoken to in two years because of things he'd done when he was using, and who he was going to find. Maria described her filing system at the law firm — eleven attorneys, eleven different ideas about alphabetical order — and it was the closest thing to a joke she'd told since we met her, and Jim laughed, and the sound of Jim laughing in the basement of his church while the world ended outside was so incongruous and so human that I almost cried.

Sienna sat next to me. Not touching. Just near. She'd found a can of peaches in the pantry and was eating them with a plastic fork, and at one point she offered me one and I took it and the peach was sweet and cold and perfect and the conversation had moved on to something else and I ate the peach and didn't say anything and the moment didn't need me to say anything.

I want you to know about these hours because they matter as much as the crises. Surviving isn't just the running and the hiding. It's also the peaches. It's also the frog named Fitzgerald. Small ordinary moments that remind you what you're surviving *for* — a question the notebook and the binoculars can't answer.

---

Sienna couldn't sit still.

By the second day we'd established a protocol for the steeple — two-hour observation shifts, binoculars, the notebook for logging Turned positions. The steeple was the best tactical asset we had: a hundred-foot sightline in every direction, elevated, with louver openings on all four sides. The problem was communication. Seeing a threat meant nothing if you couldn't warn the people on the ground.

Jim solved it. He'd been cleaning out the children's ministry closet — Vacation Bible School supplies, construction paper, glue sticks, a felt Noah's Ark — and found a pair of walkie-talkies. FRS radios, the kind you buy at Walmart for twelve dollars so your kids can play secret agent in the backyard. Bright yellow plastic. Range: maybe a mile, less with walls. The batteries were half-dead. We had spares from the church's emergency kit.

"Toys," Maria said, looking at them.

"Radios," I said. "One in the steeple, one on the ground. The person watching can talk to the person moving. Range is short but we're working in a six-block radius. It's enough."

They were cheap and tinny and the transmission button stuck if you pressed it too hard. They were also the difference between a watcher and a guide. The steeple became a nerve center.

On the second day, Sienna announced she was going to scout the surrounding blocks. Not asked — announced. I opened my mouth to argue and she said, "I'm not asking," and took one of the walkie-talkies and left through the side door before Jim could finish saying "Be careful."

She came back three hours later.

I was in the steeple with the other walkie-talkie and the binoculars, and I'd tracked her for the first two blocks before she moved out of my sightline. We'd used the radios twice — once when I spotted a cluster of three Turned drifting south on Maple and warned her to detour east, once when she'd reached the interchange and I couldn't see her and her voice came through the static saying "I'm fine, stop asking" in the tone of someone who needed to not be managed. The radios weren't perfect. The range dropped in and out, the static was constant, and there were dead zones behind the larger buildings where the signal vanished entirely. But when I watched her cross Highway 21, moving well, I'd known she was coming because she'd radioed from two blocks out. Then I watched her face as she came through the side door, and I knew something was wrong — her expression flat, postponing whatever she'd seen.

She climbed to the steeple. We sat on opposite sides of the narrow space, the binoculars between us, the late October sun cutting through the louvers.

"The interchange," she said. "I went to the interchange."

"Sienna —"

"The military vehicles are still there. Humvees, trucks, the whole perimeter. Some of the Turned are still in the area — maybe fifteen, twenty. They're scattered. Not coordinated like the ones here." She paused. "The bodies are still there too. The ones who died in the firefight. Soldiers who were shot before they turned."

I waited.

"The Turned are eating them."

The steeple was very quiet. Below us, through the floor, I could hear Dale's knife on wood.

"It's methodical. They crouch over the bodies and they — they *take pieces.* One at a time. Carefully. Like they're rationing. There are maybe six bodies left out of what was probably — I don't know, however many died in the gunfire. There were more. You can tell. There were more."

Her hands were in her lap and they were steady. Her voice was steady. But her eyes said the floor had opened up beneath her last standing assumption.

"I was wrong," she said. "About going back there. The Turned are congregating around the bodies as a food source. Going there for equipment means going through them while they're feeding. And they noticed me. Not the herding behavior. They looked at me the way a dog looks at you when it's eating and you get too close. Protective. Territorial. I've never seen them do that before."

She paused. "And there was a sound. When the one closest to me looked up — it made a sound. Short, sharp, not like the drone. More like a bark. A chirp. And two others, maybe thirty yards away, immediately oriented toward it and started moving in my direction. Not the slow drift. Fast. Purposeful. Like the sound was a signal — *food here, come now.*"

"And the soldiers," she added. "The ones that turned — some of them had taken off their body armor. Kevlar vests, jackets, helmets, stacked in piles next to the vehicles. Not scattered — removed. Deliberately. Like the equipment was uncomfortable, or in the way of something."

"That's new," I said. "All of it. The herding behavior is about reproduction — about scaring you into turning. What you're describing is about calories. Those are different drives. And the sound — that's not the summoning drone. That's something else. Something directed."

"I know what it is, Nate. You don't need to categorize it for me. They were eating people."

She was right. But categorizing was what I did instead of feeling, and feeling would mean sitting with the image of Turned crouched over human remains and processing what it meant for the future — that when the Walmart food ran out, the Turned would remember that people are made of calories.

"The supplies," I said. "Was there anything accessible without going through the feeding area?"

"Maybe. The trucks at the back of the perimeter. I couldn't get close enough to check. I'd need to go back. With someone." She looked at me. "Not yet. I need to — I need to not think about it for a while."

I wanted to say something useful. Something analytical that would reframe the horror into data. Instead what came out was: "Are you okay?"

It was a stupid question. She wasn't okay. Nobody was okay. But she looked at me and her face did something I hadn't seen before — a crack in the composure, brief, quickly sealed — and she said, "No. But I'm here. That counts."

We sat in the steeple and watched the sun move across the parking lot. The Turned below shifted with it — that slow collective turn, faces tilting toward the light. I watched Sienna's profile against the louver slats and the sunset light caught her jaw and her throat and my brain did the thing again, the useless thing, the *notice this* thing, and I looked away.

"Jaylen's seven," she said. After a long silence. "He's obsessed with dinosaurs. He can name every species in the Cretaceous period. When I left for school in the morning he'd be at the kitchen table with his dinosaur books and he'd quiz me. 'Sienna, what's bigger, a T-rex or a Giganotosaurus?' I always got it wrong on purpose because it made him so happy to correct me."

She was quiet.

"I don't know if he's alive," she said. "Oklahoma City is big. The population density. If they didn't make it to my grandmother's before —" She stopped. Took a breath. "I can handle the Turned. I can handle what I saw today. I can't handle not knowing about Jaylen. That's the thing that's going to break me, if something does."

"It won't."

"You don't know that."

"No. But you walked through a military staging area full of — through *that* — and you came back and you're here and you're telling me about it. Whatever breaks you, it isn't this."

She looked at me. The expression was unreadable. Then she said, "You're not bad at this."

"At what?"

"At being a person. You think you're bad at it. You're not."

I didn't know what to do with that so I looked through the binoculars. The Walmart across I-40 had a cluster of Turned in its parking lot — twenty, twenty-five, more than I'd seen there before. They were milling in a pattern I didn't recognize, tighter than their usual spacing, and some of them were twitchy — small jerky movements, heads snapping toward nothing, a restlessness that felt different from their normal stillness. Like a voltage building up. Like static before a storm.

I wrote it in the notebook: *Walmart cluster. ~25. Agitated. Something different about the group dynamics at this density. Watch this.*

I underlined "watch this" twice.

Before heading down I tried something. There was a stack of hymnals on the steeple shelf — dusty, dog-eared, left from before. I picked one up and dropped it out the louver opening. It hit the parking lot asphalt below with a flat crack that was startlingly loud in the silence.

The three nearest Turned oriented instantly — heads snapping toward the sound, bodies shifting weight, the beginning of movement. They took two steps toward the noise. Then three. I counted: thirty seconds of sustained attention. Then the interest faded. Their heads drifted back. They resumed their positions, the sound already forgotten.

A single noise was a glance — brief, distractable. But the Turned at the Lyles' house responded to the continuous bullhorn. A sustained noise was a summons. The stare, not the glance, was what brought them in.

I wrote this down. It seemed like the kind of thing that might matter later.

---

Jim held a service on Wednesday. Six people in candlelight. He read a psalm, said a prayer, was quiet. Ruth sang "Amazing Grace" — first verse, thin soprano, cracks on the high notes. The silence after was the most sacred thing I'd ever experienced, and I don't believe in sacred.

Later that night I dreamed I was back in the trailer. Everything was right — the wood-grain paneling, the burn mark on the counter, the Sprite and Saltines lined up neat. But the front door was open and someone was standing on the step, facing in, and the someone was me. Not a mirror — a second me, standing in the gravel in my gym shorts and the too-small Panthers t-shirt, looking in with a face that was smooth and blank and tilted slightly toward the porch light the way the Turned tilt toward the sun. The me in the doorway raised one hand. Not waving. Reaching. And I understood, in the dream-logic way where understanding doesn't require evidence, that if I took the hand I would never be afraid again, and the price of never being afraid was everything else.

I woke gasping in the church basement. My heart was hammering — I pressed my fist against my sternum and counted, the way I'd learned to, ninety-eight, ninety-two, eighty-six. Around me, the others slept. Dale's knife had stopped. Ruth was breathing in the measured rhythm of a woman who'd been falling asleep to the same internal clock for seventy-two years. I lay there until the count dropped to seventy and the dream faded from image to residue, and then I got up because the alternative was closing my eyes and seeing myself standing in the doorway again.

I went to the sanctuary and found Jim sitting in a pew in the dark, hands folded, staring at the cross on the wall. He didn't look like a man at peace. He looked like a man holding something heavy.

"Can't sleep either?" I said.

"I sleep fine." A pause. "I pray poorly." Another pause. "Do you know what the hardest part of faith is, son?"

"No."

"It's not believing when things are good. It's not even believing when things are bad. The hardest part is believing when things are *meaningless.* When there's no plan, no purpose, no lesson. When it's just — some biology gone wrong. Some accident nobody caused and nobody deserved and none of it was aimed at us."

I sat down. One pew back. Giving him the space.

"I've been a pastor for thirty years and a soldier before that. I've buried children. I've held dying men. And in all of it I found meaning because I believed God was in it somewhere, working through the suffering toward something I couldn't see. But this." He gestured at the walls, the darkness, the world outside. "This isn't suffering toward something. This is just — biology. Indifferent biology. And I keep waiting for God to show me the meaning and He keeps not showing me and I keep having faith anyway and I don't know if that makes me faithful or just stubborn."

"Does it matter?"

He looked at me. "It matters to me."

"I mean — does it matter *functionally*? You put the sign in the window. People are alive because of it. You're here making coffee and holding services and keeping people together. Whether God told you to do that or your own decency told you — the result is the same."

"That's a very young thing to say."

"I'm fifteen. Everything I say is young."

He almost smiled. Then the almost-smile faded and he was just a tired old man in a dark church. "I told Ruth the Lord protects the peaceful. And I believe that. But I also know it's the metoprolol, and I know it's the beta-blockade, and I know that if the medication runs out I'll have to find out whether my faith is strong enough to keep my heart rate below whatever the number is. And I don't know if it is."

He said this to me and not to any of the adults because I was the one who'd named the mechanism, and naming it had made me the person he could be honest with, and I didn't want that responsibility and I had it anyway.

"Your faith got us here," I said. "That's data."

"Data." He said the word like it was a foreign food he was willing to try. "I suppose it is."

He was quiet for a while. Then he said, almost to himself: "I had a dream last night. Water rising in a valley. People walking single file along a ridge — our people, I think, though I couldn't see faces. And a sound. Not music. A frequency. Like a tuning fork pressed against the bones of the earth."

He shook his head. "Probably the tinnitus. Vietnam gave me a lifetime supply."

I didn't say anything. It was a dream. People dream about water and walking and strange sounds. It didn't mean anything.

But I wrote it in the notebook later, because I write everything in the notebook, and months afterward I would read that entry and the hair on my arms would stand up, because Jim had described — exactly, precisely, in details he had no way of knowing — the herd crossing in the river valley and the frequency emitter at the university. He'd dreamed it on Day 7. We wouldn't live it until Day 40.

He sat in the dark pew and I sat behind him and neither of us said anything else and after a while I went back to the basement and lay on a pew and looked at the ceiling and thought about faith and pharmacology and the place where they overlapped, and I didn't sleep but I was closer to sleeping than I'd been in a week.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #3:**

*Day 7. Seven people. Fourteen Turned outside. The number's growing.*

*Three behavioral modes. Three different signals. The drone says "something is happening here" — herding, reproduction, fear-farming. The short sharp call says "food here, come now" — coordinated feeding. And something changes at density — the Walmart cluster is at twenty-five and the behavior is twitchy, restless, something building. I'm building a taxonomy that's growing faster than my understanding.*

*The Turned are shedding clothing. Pembrook's robe. The soldiers' body armor. The scrub woman's top. The oldest Turned are the most exposed. The sun-facing and the undressing have to be connected — the exposed skin is always the skin facing the light — but I can't see the mechanism yet.*

*Jim doubts his faith in private and performs it in public and the performance saves lives. I understand the mechanism in private and fail to act in public and the understanding saves nobody. Being right is not the same as being useful. Knowing is not the same as doing.*

# Chapter 9: The Asset

On the eighth day, a man walked into the church carrying a CB radio, a case of truck-stop beef jerky, and a flask of bourbon. His name was Marcus Webb. He was forty-two. He was a long-haul driver out of Tulsa who'd been hauling industrial shelving on I-40 when the highways turned into what he described as "a parking lot made of fire."

Jim made coffee. I watched him do it — the same ritual, the same unhurried motions, the same thirty minutes of conversation while Marcus held the mug in both hands and Jim watched the way the hands adjusted to the heat. The same diagnostic. When Marcus set the mug down and picked it back up with a slightly different grip — the unconscious micro-correction that living hands make without thinking — Jim's shoulders relaxed by a fraction that only I noticed because I'd been watching for it. Marcus was human. The coffee had confirmed it.

He sat in the basement on a folding chair too small for him and told us about three days in a truck cab. He said it flatly, without drama — reporting, not feeling.

"I pulled onto a service road. Parked. Sat." He shrugged. "I've done five-day runs to Tacoma. I know how to sit."

"Three days," Jim said. "Alone."

"I was drinking." He held up the flask — stainless steel, dented. "Bourbon. It's not a solution. But it kept the —" He made a vague gesture at his chest. "It kept things level. For a while."

Maria, from the pantry closet, said: "Alcohol is a depressant. It suppresses the stress response short-term. Then you rebound worse than baseline. It's borrowing calm from tomorrow." She said this with the casual expertise of a woman who'd lived with an addict and had read every pamphlet in every waiting room.

Marcus looked at her. "You're not wrong."

"I rarely am." No warmth in it. Just fact. Maria's humor was like that — razor-edged, delivered without a smile, requiring you to decide for yourself whether she was joking. She usually wasn't.

Dale, carving in his corner, said nothing. But I saw his jaw tighten.

---

The CB radio was a Cobra 29 in a carrying case with an external antenna. Marcus set it on a folding table and powered it on and the static filled the room — the white noise of a spectrum that used to carry a thousand conversations. We gathered around it the way people in another century would have gathered around a fire.

Marcus scanned. Most channels dead. Channel 9 — emergency — carried a faint automated loop:

"Shelter in place. Remain calm. Assistance is being coordinated."

"How long has it been saying that?" Sienna asked.

"Five days. Nobody's updated it."

The system generating the message still ran, but the people managing it were gone. The automated loop on Channel 9 was the sound of that belief dying. The government wasn't coordinating assistance. The government was a recording playing to empty rooms.

He kept scanning. Fragments — half-sentences, voices fading in and out. A man in Missouri. Gone by morning. A woman in Oklahoma reporting I-44 impassable. A group in Memphis coordinating evacuation south. Marcus had listened for them the next day. Nothing.

"Channel 21," he said. "This is the one."

Static. Then, faint, a woman's voice. Calm. Precise. The cadence of someone reading from notes:

"— repeat, the mechanism is endocrine. The organism's activation is triggered by sustained elevation of catecholamine levels — specifically epinephrine and norepinephrine —"

Static swallowed the rest. The signal broke. Marcus adjusted the dial, the antenna. Nothing.

"That's all?"

"She broadcasts twice a day. Morning, evening. The signal's weak — low-power transmitter. I've caught maybe six fragments in three days." He pulled a piece of paper from his jacket pocket — a page torn from a logbook, covered in his handwriting. "I've been writing down what I can catch."

The fragments, assembled:
- *"mechanism is endocrine"*
- *"beta-adrenergic antagonists are protective"*
- *"the organism's protein structures do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny"*
- *"this is not a mutation — this is not a bioweapon"*
- Something about a frequency — acoustic — that *"disrupts collective coordination"*
- A name: *"Dr. Eleanor Moss"*
- A reference to *"the campus"* and a state route number — 16

*Do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny.* I read that fragment three times. Since Day One, everyone — Reddit, the news anchors, the conspiracy theorists — assumed this was a pathogen. A virus, a prion, a bioweapon. Dr. Moss had just crossed out every one of those categories. Not terrestrial. Not from here. The organism-on-the-comet article I'd read in *Popular Science* surfaced and connected to the fragment, and the connection was so obvious and so enormous that I sat there silent for a full minute.

State Route 16. It ran north through the Boston Mountains to the university towns on the other side. The University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A real research university with biology labs and equipment and, apparently, at least one scientist who was still doing science while the world ended.

"Fayetteville," Marcus said. He'd arrived at the same conclusion. "Sixty miles northwest. Through the mountains."

---

Marcus Webb's brain contained a three-dimensional map of every road, rest stop, warehouse, and distribution center within three hundred miles — fifteen years of routes most people never saw from the highway. More valuable than anything he carried.

"The Walmart's almost stripped," he said. We were in the basement, just the two of us. "I walked through it on my way here. Perishables spoiled. Canned goods half-depleted. Another week, bare shelves."

"Sienna found the military blockade," I said. "The Turned are feeding on the dead."

Marcus was quiet for a moment. Then: "How many bodies?"

"She counted six remaining. There were more."

"The interchange." He nodded, as if confirming something he'd already suspected. "High-traffic area. Lots of initial casualties. The Turned would drift there for the food. Which means the interchange is a feeding ground now, not just a concentration point."

"Could we drive through it?" I was still thinking like the old world — roads go places, cars are faster than walking. It seemed obvious.

"Drive." He said the word like I'd suggested we fly. "Kid, I need you to understand something about vehicles in this situation. A car engine is the loudest thing in a silent world. You fire up a truck and every Turned in a half-mile radius knows where you are. The highways are funnels — they concentrate everything into narrow corridors. Every interchange, every rest stop, every truck stop is a congregation point because those are the places people went when they were trying to get out, and those people are still there, and they're not people anymore."

He paused. Took a sip from the flask.

"You need to understand what happened on the highways that first night. Everybody's in their car. Everybody's got the radio on — the emergency broadcasts, the news, the same loop of *shelter in place* and *unexplained behavioral episodes* and nobody saying what's actually happening. People are scared. People who are scared drive fast. They tailgate, they swerve, they run red lights. The radio's telling them the world is ending and they're doing eighty in a sixty trying to get home to their families or get out of the city or just get *somewhere*, and their heart rates are through the roof, and the adrenaline is pumping, and —" He spread his hands. "You see where this goes. They turned at the wheel. Doing seventy, eighty miles an hour. The Turned don't know how to drive. They don't know how to brake. The car keeps going until it hits something — a guardrail, another car, the median. And then the next car hits that one. And the car behind that one. I saw a pileup on I-40 near Ozark that was thirty vehicles deep. Some of them were still running when I drove past, engines idling, wheels against guardrails, the drivers standing in the road with smooth faces."

He shook his head. "The highways didn't just fill up with Turned. They filled up with wrecks. The panic itself made the roads impassable before the Turned ever set foot on the asphalt. Every on-ramp is a bottleneck of crushed metal. Every bridge is a dam of jackknifed semis. You couldn't drive through it if the Turned weren't even there."

He paused again. "I drove for three days before I parked. The last ten miles I was threading between abandoned vehicles and clusters of Turned, and two of those clusters started massing up in a way I did not like. If I'd stalled, or hit something, or blown a tire — I'd be standing in a rest stop parking lot right now with a smooth face."

Roads weren't escape routes. Roads were traps — funnels that concentrated the Turned at every chokepoint, plugged with the wreckage of a million panicked drivers who turned at the wheel. Another assumption gone.

"So roads are out."

"Roads where people traveled are out. Back roads — farm roads, forest service roads — are better. Low traffic before, low density now. But even back roads connect to highways eventually, and the connection points are where it gets bad."

"What about off-road? Cross-country?"

"In what? My rig? A Humvee? The terrain between here and Fayetteville is the Boston Mountains. It's the roughest country in the state — sandstone bluffs, creek hollows, ravines. No vehicle short of a military crawler is getting through that. And a military crawler is the loudest thing you can drive."

He took a sip from his flask. Small. Measured. Not getting drunk — maintaining.

"There's a trail," he said. "The Ozark Highlands Trail. Runs through the national forest, mostly ridgelines. I've crossed it hauling timber loads — the forest service roads intersect it every ten, fifteen miles. Once you're up in the mountains, there's nothing. No population. No highways. The Turned go where people were. People weren't in the deep woods."

"You know the OHT?"

"I know every road that crosses it. Which means I know where you can get on and off." He looked at me. "It's sixty miles of mountain trail. With a seventy-two-year-old. In October. It's insane."

"Is there a better option?"

"No." He poured another measure into the flask cap. "That's the problem."

There was something about Marcus that I recognized but couldn't name until the third day. His calm wasn't like Jim's — effortful, maintained by faith and medication. It wasn't like mine — defensive, analytical. Marcus's calm was a hollowness. The flat affect of a man who had been too sad for too long to be afraid.

In game theory there's a concept called a dominant strategy — one that produces the best outcome regardless of what the other players do. Marcus's depression was his dominant strategy. The thing slowly destroying his life outside the apocalypse was keeping him alive inside it. He couldn't feel the acute terror the organism needed because something in him had broken years ago, right where the organism needed to reach.

He didn't talk about this. He talked about roads and supply chains. But on the third night, sitting in the basement after everyone else was asleep, he showed me something.

His phone. Dead, battery gone two weeks ago. He turned it on anyway — nothing, black screen — and held it up.

"My daughter," he said. "Ava. She's nine. Tulsa. The lock screen was a photo of her at her birthday party. Purple frosting on her face."

He looked at the dead phone.

"The battery died and I still carry it. My ex-wife would say it's typical. 'Marcus holds onto things that don't work anymore.' She said that about our marriage and she was right." He put the phone back in his pocket. "Fayetteville is northwest. Tulsa is west. Every mile we walk toward Dr. Moss is a mile that isn't toward Ava. I know that. I'm doing it anyway because the math says Moss is the priority and I believe in the math. But I want you to know that the math is costing me something."

"I know."

"No, you don't. You're fifteen. You think sacrifice is a concept. It's not. It's walking the wrong way while knowing the right way exists." He capped the flask. "I hate roads. Did you know that? Fifteen years of driving and I hate every mile of highway I've ever seen. The white lines, the rest stops, the same Denny's in every truck stop in America. I hate it. And I know every road between here and Oklahoma like I know my own heartbeat because hating a thing and knowing it aren't mutually exclusive. Ask Jim about that — he'll tell you it's the same with faith."

I didn't know what to say. Marcus wasn't asking for comfort. He was putting something true into the record so that if he didn't make it to Tulsa, at least one person would understand what it cost him not to try.

"I'll put it in the journal," I said.

"Don't put in the crying part."

"You're not crying."

"I was going to. You interrupted." A beat. "That's a joke, kid. I make those sometimes. They're bad."

"You'll fit in. Jim's are worse."

---

On Thursday evening, Marcus caught another fragment from Dr. Moss. Clearer this time — she'd adjusted her antenna or the atmospheric conditions had shifted.

"— if you are receiving this, my name is Dr. Eleanor Moss. I am at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. I have data. I have a frequency. I have medication. If you can reach me —"

Static. Then, one more fragment:

"— every fortress is a countdown. Stay small. Stay quiet. Move before the density —"

Gone.

Every fortress is a countdown. I looked at the cinder-block walls of Grace Tabernacle and thought about the fourteen Turned in the parking lot, the twenty-five at Walmart, the feeding ground at the interchange — six clocks in my notebook, each counting down to a zero that meant we had to be somewhere else.

"She's right," I said. "About the countdown."

Jim said nothing. His hands were folded. His face was the face of a man who'd been asked to leave his church, his congregation — even the Turned ones — and who knew the ask was coming and had been trying to pray his way out of it.

"Not yet," he said. "But soon."

Sienna, in the steeple, called down: "Another one just arrived in the parking lot. Fifteen now."

The number was growing. The clocks were running. And somewhere on the other side of the Boston Mountains, a woman with a radio and a lab was broadcasting into the dark, and we were the only ones listening.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #4:**

*Day 8. Seven people. Fifteen Turned. Counting up.*

*Sixty miles through the worst terrain in the state. Moss has answers. We have canned corn and a countdown.*

*Every timeline converges on us. The food runs out. The Turned expand their search radius. The density builds. These cinder-block walls will not save us.*

*This is the team. This is the plan. This is what we have.*

*God help us, and I'm saying that as a figure of speech, but Jim — if you're reading this — feel free to take it literally. We could use the help.*


# Chapter 10: The Lyles

We heard the bullhorn on Day 10.

I was in the steeple on morning watch — 6 AM, early October light catching frost on the parking lot gravel, sixteen Turned in their positions like chess pieces on a board I was learning to read. The newest arrival was a woman in hospital scrubs who'd walked in from Highway 21 sometime in the night. She stood near the road, swaying faintly, face tilted toward the eastern horizon. Her scrub top was gone — just the pants and a sports bra, her torso bare to the morning air. The skin across her shoulders had the greenish cast I'd been tracking, darker than Pembrook's at the same stage. She'd removed the top herself. It was folded on the curb behind her, neat, the way you'd fold laundry.

Then, from the north — maybe three blocks — a voice, amplified, distorted by distance and cheap electronics:

"THIS IS A SECURE ZONE. SURVIVORS WELCOME. WE ARE ARMED AND DEFENDED. COME TO THE AMERICAN FLAG ON CEDAR STREET."

I put the binoculars to my eyes and found it: a house, two-story, three blocks north and one east. Plywood over the windows. A generator humming — I could hear it now, a low mechanical drone that carried in the silence. An American flag hung from the roof gutters, oversized, the kind you'd see at a car dealership. And on the front porch, a man with a bullhorn and a rifle slung across his chest.

I watched the Turned react. Every head in the parking lot turned toward the sound. Several began walking — not toward the church, toward the noise. The woman in scrubs drifted north. Two others followed. The bullhorn was a magnet, and it was pulling Turned away from us and toward whoever was up there broadcasting their position to every organism in a half-mile radius.

I went downstairs.

---

"Craig Lyle," Jim said. He was sitting at the folding table with his coffee, his metoprolol, and his Bible. He didn't look surprised. "Sheriff's deputy. His wife Tammy runs the range on Highway 64. Son Brett, plays linebacker for Clarksville."

"He's using a bullhorn," I said.

"Craig would."

"He's drawing them. I watched three Turned start walking toward his house in the last five minutes."

Jim sipped his coffee. "Craig is a good man. He protected this town for twenty years. He's doing what he knows how to do."

"What he knows how to do is going to get him killed."

Jim set his mug down. He looked at me with the patient, measuring expression that I'd learned meant he was about to say something I needed to hear and didn't want to.

"You're right," he said. "And being right doesn't give you the right to let him die without trying."

"I'm not saying —"

"You're saying stay away because he's loud and he's wrong and his wrongness is useful to us because it draws Turned away from the church. You're calculating the strategic value of another man's mistake."

The kitchen was very quiet. Ruth, at the top of the stairs, had stopped pretending to read.

"I wasn't —" But I was. The thought had been there — half-formed, ugly — that the Lyles' noise was pulling Turned north and that was good for us. I hadn't articulated it because that would mean being the kind of person who calculates the value of another family's danger. I didn't want to be that person, but I was, and Jim had seen it before I had.

"We need to talk to them," Jim said.

Sienna, who'd been doing push-ups against the wall — her morning routine, the athlete's body demanding movement — stopped and turned around. "They have guns and a generator. We have canned corn and a pastor."

"We have information," I said.

"Information they won't want to hear." She looked at me. "You're going to walk up to an armed sheriff's deputy and tell him his survival strategy is wrong? You?"

The "you" carried weight. She didn't mean it cruelly. She meant: you, the kid who won't make eye contact at the grocery store, who couldn't order food at a restaurant without rehearsing the sentence. That "you."

"Not me," I said. "Jim and Marcus. They're adults. Craig will listen to adults."

"Craig will listen to authority," Marcus said from his corner — sitting, listening, saying nothing until he had something worth saying, the way Marcus always did. "He's law enforcement. He respects rank. Jim's a pastor, I'm old enough to not be dismissed. We go."

---

They went at noon, when I'd observed the Turned were most dispersed. I watched from the steeple, walkie-talkie in hand, the same setup as every mission since we'd found the radios — I called down the positions, they adjusted their route. Jim and Marcus walked north on the residential streets behind the church — side streets, quiet, a few Turned visible at distance but none close. They moved at Jim's pace, which was the pace of a man who'd been walking calmly through a dangerous world for two weeks and had elevated it to an art form.

I had the binoculars. Sienna was beside me — she'd insisted on steeple duty during the mission — and we were sitting eighteen inches apart in the narrow space and I was acutely aware of every one of those eighteen inches because I was fifteen and the person next to me was Sienna Okafor.

She smelled like soap. The church had bar soap in the bathroom and she used it and she smelled like Ivory soap and I hated my brain for noticing this during a surveillance operation.

"They're there," Sienna said. She had sharper eyes than me. Through the binoculars I found them: Jim and Marcus at the Lyles' porch. Craig Lyle had come out — big man, crew cut, sheriff's department jacket, rifle in his hands but pointed down. Body language: wary, not hostile. He shook Jim's hand.

They talked for twenty minutes. I couldn't hear it. I could read posture: Jim leaning forward, earnest, palms open. Marcus standing back, arms crossed, the body language of a man offering backup, not argument. Craig listening. Head tilting. The small adjustments people make when they're processing information that doesn't fit their model.

Then Craig shook his head. Politely. He clapped Jim on the shoulder. He said something. Jim said something back. Craig went inside.

Jim and Marcus walked back. Twenty minutes there, twenty minutes home. My heart rate was elevated the entire time and when they came through the side door I realized I'd been clenching my jaw so hard my teeth ached.

"He listened," Jim said. "He didn't hear."

"What did you tell him?"

"That the noise draws them. That the fortifications create a target. That the mechanism is about physiology, not firepower."

"And?"

"He said he appreciated the concern. He said he had a duty to protect his family. He said he'd survived twenty years in law enforcement by trusting his training and he wasn't going to stop now." Jim paused. "He's not wrong about any of that. He's just applying it to the wrong situation."

"Cognitive dissonance," I said. "The brain rejects new information that contradicts existing belief because revising the belief feels worse than the danger of keeping it. He can't hear you because hearing it would mean everything he's done — the boards, the guns, the perimeter — was wrong. And if that's wrong, he doesn't know how to protect his family. That uncertainty is more terrifying than the Turned."

Jim looked at me. "That's not wrong either. Knowing why he won't listen doesn't help him listen."

"No. But it tells me something about what we're up against. The human brain is its own obstacle, and it might be the bigger one."

---

That afternoon, Ruth did something that changed my model of her.

We had a problem. The church's water supply was gravity-fed from the municipal tower, and the pressure had been dropping for days. The tank on the roof — a supplemental cistern Jim had installed years ago for the baptistery — had a float valve that regulated inflow, and the valve was stuck. No pressure meant no refill. We had maybe two days of stored water.

Dale offered to climb to the roof. Marcus said he'd go. Jim said it was his church and his roof. I started calculating whether we could rig a manual pump from parts in the building.

Ruth walked past all of us, went to the utility closet, and came back with a pipe wrench, a roll of Teflon tape, and a pair of channel-lock pliers. She climbed the access ladder to the roof hatch — seventy-two years old, bad knees — and we heard her up there for about fifteen minutes. Clanking. One muffled curse. Then the sound of water running.

She came back down with grease on her hands and her cardigan askew.

"My husband was a plumber," she said, to the room's collective silence. "Forty-one years. I helped him on jobs every summer. The float valve was corroded — I freed the stem and re-seated the gasket. It'll hold for now. The Teflon tape is a temporary fix; you'll want to replace the entire assembly when circumstances permit." She looked at our faces. "What? You thought all I could do was correct your grammar?"

"I thought —" I started.

"You thought I was an old woman with a pill bottle and a sharp tongue. That's fair. I cultivated that impression. It's useful — people who underestimate you leave you alone, and being left alone is my preferred state." She washed her hands at the kitchen sink. "Leonard — my husband — died in 2019. Heart attack on a job site. I learned more from him than from any education course I ever took, and I took all of them. He could fix anything." She dried her hands. "I can fix *most* things. The distinction is important."

She went back upstairs to her novel.

I updated my mental model of Ruth Fenn: a woman who'd spent forty years alongside a tradesman and absorbed a skillset none of us had thought to ask about because we'd been too busy being corrected about grammar.

The assumptions you don't question are the ones that kill you. I'd written that in the notebook about the Lyles. It applied closer to home than I'd realized.

---

That evening, Maria and I had a conversation that I didn't expect and didn't like.

She was doing inventory — counting cans, updating the rationing spreadsheet she'd scratched onto a church bulletin. I was at the folding table with the notebook, mapping Turned positions.

"The Lyles have food," she said. Not looking up from her count.

"The Lyles have a lot of things."

"If they fall — when they fall — their supplies will be in that house. Canned goods, ammunition, the generator fuel. It'll be scattered in the rubble, but it'll be there."

I put my pen down. "You're planning to scavenge the Lyles' supplies after they die."

"I'm planning for the group to survive. Those are the same thing." She turned a can of green beans label-out and placed it on the shelf. "Every person who joins us costs us 1.3 days of food at current rationing. Marcus cost us 1.3 days. The next person will too. If we take in survivors without replenishing supplies, we starve together instead of separately. That's not compassion. That's arithmetic."

"Maria —"

"I'm not saying don't help people. I'm saying know the cost. And I'm saying that when the Lyles' house comes apart — and it will, Nate, you know it will — the supplies in that house become available and we need to be ready to get them before the Turned scatter them or the rain ruins them."

She was right. I hated that she was right. I hated more that the thought hadn't occurred to me — that Maria had looked at the Lyles' probable death and calculated the caloric yield before I had.

"That's cold," I said.

"Yes." She put the last can on the shelf and closed the closet door. "So is January. We'll need the calories."

She went to bed. I sat at the table and stared at my map and thought about whether there was a real line between being cold and being right, or whether we drew it after the fact to feel better about decisions we'd already made.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #5:**

*Day 10. Three modes confirmed. Herding is coordinated strategy. The food-driven behavior is coordinated predation. The swarm is the coordination collapsing entirely. I need a better taxonomy but the pattern is there.*

*The clothing pattern connects to the green skin and the light orientation. Bare feet first, then shirts. The oldest Turned are the most exposed. The organism is systematically removing anything that covers the skin. I'm circling something I'm not ready to name.*

*Maria is already planning what to do with the Lyles' supplies when they fall. I think she always sees the cost. I think the cost is what she's calculating when the rest of us think she's just counting cans.*

*I called Craig's situation cognitive dissonance. Mine might be too. I understand the mechanism and still can't act on it. Knowing and doing are separated by a gap I haven't figured out how to cross. The textbook doesn't have a chapter for that.*

# Chapter 11: What the Radio Said

On Day 12, Dr. Moss gave us a longer broadcast.

Marcus had been working the CB every evening, scanning Channel 21, catching fragments. Most were static. Some were repetitions of things we'd already heard — the endocrine mechanism, the beta-blocker protocol. But on this evening, the atmospheric conditions aligned or her transmitter was running better or whatever variables govern radio propagation decided to cooperate, and we got twelve unbroken minutes.

Everyone gathered in the basement. Jim in his chair. Ruth on a folding chair with her novel closed on her lap. Dale carving — he'd finished the beagle and was starting something new, a bird of some kind, though it was too early to tell what species. Maria standing by the pantry closet with her arms crossed. Sienna sitting on the floor with her back against the wall, legs extended, the posture of an athlete at rest — which still looked more alert than most people standing up. And me, at the table, with the notebook open and a pen in my hand, writing as fast as I could.

The static thinned and Dr. Moss's voice came through, clearer than we'd ever heard it.

"— repeat this broadcast daily for any survivors in the northwest Arkansas region. My name is Dr. Eleanor Moss. I am a research biologist at the University of Arkansas. I am broadcasting from the life sciences building on campus. This facility has generator power, laboratory equipment, and supplies sufficient for an extended period."

She paused. I could hear her turning a page.

"I want to address a misconception that may be costing lives. Many survivor groups have adopted a fortification strategy — boarding windows, arming perimeters, concentrating in defensible positions. This strategy is counterproductive. The organism's collective behavior is drawn to human activity. Noise, light, electromagnetic output, and particularly the biochemical signatures of stress — all of these attract the Turned. Fortification concentrates these signals. Every defended position I have observed or received reports about has followed the same trajectory: the defenses attract Turned, the Turned accumulate, and when the local density exceeds a critical threshold — what I'm calling the density threshold — the collective behavior destabilizes."

She said this the way you'd describe a chemical reaction — factual, measured, the voice of a scientist reading from data.

"Below the threshold, the Turned exhibit patient herding behavior. Targeted social manipulation. Voice mimicry. They are coordinated, strategic, and nonviolent. Above the threshold, the coordination collapses into undirected destruction. The patient predator becomes a demolition event. The threshold varies — I do not yet have reliable numbers, and I want to stress that I do not have reliable numbers, because giving you a number that's wrong could get you killed. What I can tell you is that the threshold appears to depend on spatial density, not raw count. Thirty Turned spread across a square mile are below threshold. Thirty in a parking lot may not be."

I was writing as fast as I could. Sienna was watching me write. Marcus had his hand on the radio as if physical contact could hold the signal steady.

"The implications for survival are these: stay small. Stay quiet. Do not concentrate. Do not fortify. Do not engage. If you are receiving this and you are alive, it is because your biochemistry is below the activation threshold. Do not do anything that raises it. Every fortress is a countdown. Every act of defense is an invitation."

Static intruded for a few seconds. Then she came back, and her voice had shifted — less clinical, more human, as if she'd looked up from her notes and was speaking directly to whoever was listening.

"There is more to communicate. The organism's adaptation rate is accelerating. The Turned I observe on campus are more coordinated, more efficient, and more physically resilient than the Turned from week one. This is not a static threat. It is improving. I have data on this — spectrographic analysis, behavioral timelines — that I cannot transmit by radio. If you can reach this facility, I can share what I know. And what I know may — I want to be careful about promising — may include countermeasures."

A pause.

"If you are hearing this and you are weighing whether to move: the risk of staying increases every day. The risk of moving can be managed. I recommend low-density routes. Avoid highways, interchanges, and urban corridors. The Ozark National Forest is largely depopulated. The ridgeline trails offer —"

Static swallowed her. The signal broke. Marcus adjusted the antenna, scanned, found nothing. Channel 21 was empty.

---

The basement was quiet for a long time.

Jim broke it. "She didn't mention God."

"She's a scientist," I said.

"I noticed." He wasn't offended. He was noting a gap — something missing from her framework, the way a builder checks for a foundation. "Scientists describe what's happening. They don't always describe what it means."

"Maybe what it means is what's happening. Maybe there isn't a layer underneath."

"Maybe." He didn't argue. He folded his hands. "Or maybe the layer underneath is the part she hasn't found yet."

Marcus capped his flask. "The density threshold. She said it varies. She doesn't have numbers."

"I've been counting," I said. "The Walmart cluster hit twenty-five and I saw behavioral changes — twitchiness, agitation. The Lyles have maybe twenty in their perimeter and the count is growing." I wrote the number in the notebook and circled it. The most important number was the one nobody could give us.

---

Dale's knife had stopped moving.

This was notable because Dale's knife never stopped moving. In the ten days I'd known him, his hands had been in constant motion — carving, whittling, shaping. The beagle. The bird. Small abstract things he didn't name. The motion kept his brain from spinning into the places it went when it was idle.

The knife was still.

"She said the organism is adapting," he said. "Getting more efficient."

"Yes."

"Does that mean it adapts to medication? Does it — does it learn to work around the Suboxone?"

The question hung in the air. I looked at Dale and saw terror behind it — the specific terror of a man whose survival depends on a molecule and who has just been told that the thing he's surviving against is learning.

"I don't know," I said. This was the truth. "She didn't say that specifically. She said the Turned's behavior is adapting. That could mean the organism is getting better at operating human bodies. It doesn't necessarily mean it's overcoming pharmaceutical suppression."

"But it could."

"It could."

Dale picked up the knife. Started carving again. The strokes were tighter, faster, removing more material than necessary. He was making a new shape and he was making it angry.

Maria, from the pantry closet, said: "How much Suboxone do we have?"

"Eighteen days," Dale said. Without looking up. He'd been counting. Of course he'd been counting. "And then I find out whether twelve years of sobriety and six months of yoga are enough to keep my nervous system below whatever the line is." He looked up. His eyes were flat. "I'll let you know."

---

That evening nobody wanted to be alone and nobody wanted to talk about what Moss had said, so we didn't. Jim made coffee — the last of the good grounds, not the instant — and didn't apologize for the extravagance. Ruth read aloud from her romance novel, not because anyone asked but because the silence needed filling, and she chose to fill it with a scene involving a Scottish duke and an heiress and a misunderstanding about a horse, and it was so absurdly, magnificently irrelevant that we all just listened. Maria corrected a plot point. Dale said the horse breed was wrong. Marcus said he'd driven through Scotland once and the roads were terrible. These observations had nothing to do with anything and that was the entire point.

Sienna was sitting on the floor near the stairs, stretching — a habit from her old life that she maintained the way Dale maintained his carving, a way of telling her body it still existed for a reason. At one point she caught my eye and made a face — a small, private expression that meant *this is ridiculous and I'm grateful for it* — and I made a face back that meant approximately the same thing, and the exchange lasted half a second and contained more communication than anything I'd written in the notebook all week.

We didn't solve anything that evening. We didn't plan or strategize or calculate. We just occupied the same room and let the room be enough. I am recording this because the journal is supposed to be a survival document, and this was survival — the kind where you remind yourself that the people around you are people and not just assets on a board.

Marcus broke the quiet. He was sitting on his pew, back against the wall, flask between his knees.

"Question," he said. "Serious one."

Jim looked up from his Bible.

"Has anyone tried killing one?"

The room changed. Ruth's novel lowered an inch. Dale's knife paused mid-stroke. Maria's head turned from the pantry like a radar dish acquiring a target.

"They're people, Marcus," Jim said.

"They're standing in a parking lot in the rain using dead people's voices to scare other people into joining them. That's not people behavior, Jim."

Nobody had an answer. The question hung in the basement like smoke. Nobody answered it. Nobody put it away, either.

That night Marcus woke the basement.

It wasn't a scream — it was a name, pulled out of him like something physical. "Ava!" — sharp, desperate, a man reaching for something in the dark and finding nothing. By the time I was fully awake he was sitting up on his pew, hands on his knees, breathing hard. The room was quiet. Ruth had her eyes open. Dale, on the nearest pew, hadn't moved, but his voice came through the dark, low and even.

"I dream about the highway too," Dale said.

Marcus said nothing. After a minute his breathing slowed. He lay back down. The dark settled over us again.

In the morning nobody mentioned it. But the silence was different — the silence of people who'd all been awake in the dark thinking the same thing and waiting for someone else to say it.

I said it. Over breakfast — the cold oatmeal, Ruth's insistence — I said: "What happens if someone turns from a nightmare?"

The oatmeal got very quiet.

"The mechanism is fear," I said. "Adrenaline, cortisol, sustained sympathetic activation. Nightmares produce all of those. We're sleeping six feet apart in a basement. If someone crosses the threshold in their sleep —"

"They wake up Turned," Dale said. His voice was flat. He wasn't speculating. He was running the scenario the way a man in recovery runs relapse scenarios — not *if* but *when.*

"Would we know?" Ruth asked. Her hands were steady on her coffee mug but her knuckles were white. "If someone turned in their sleep. Would we know immediately, or would they — would the organism —"

"Mimic," I said. "The organism mimics. That's what herding *is.* It uses the host's voice, the host's face. If someone turned in the dark, alone, among sleepers —" I stopped. The image was there: one of us, lying still, eyes open in the dark, the grin spreading, listening to the others breathe. Using our names. *Hey, you okay?* in a voice you'd been trusting for two weeks. "We might not know until it was too late."

The basement was very still.

Maria spoke first. "We post a watch. One person awake, all night, watching the others sleep."

"Watching for what?" Dale said. "The smile? Heart rate? How do you tell the difference between a nightmare and a conversion when both look like someone thrashing in the dark?"

"Blood pressure cuff," I said. "Mine reads continuously. If someone spikes above threshold —"

"One cuff for seven people. And the person wearing it is the one you're monitoring, not the six you aren't."

Jim had been listening with his hands folded, organizing something in his head before releasing it. "We post a watch," he said. "Not to monitor. To *be there.* One person awake, watching the sleepers. Not because we can prevent a turning — we probably can't. But because if it happens, someone is awake to respond. To wake the others. To get people out."

Ruth set her mug down. "You're asking us to watch each other the way we watch *them.*"

"I'm asking us to love each other enough to stay awake."

Dale's knife was moving — fast, sharp strokes. "I'll sleep separated. Upstairs. Away from the group."

"Dale —"

"My withdrawal spikes in the early morning. Three, four AM. That's when my cortisol peaks. If anyone in this room is going to turn from a nightmare, it's me, and I'd rather be upstairs alone than downstairs among people I —" He stopped cutting. "People I don't want to hurt."

"Nobody is sleeping alone," Jim said. "That's not how we do this."

"Then how do we do this?" Marcus asked. He'd been quiet since the nightmare, the name still sitting in the air between us. "Because the kid's right. We're all dreaming bad. We're all spiking. And if someone turns —" He looked at me. "What do we do? Hold them down? Lock them in a room? Kill them?"

Nobody answered. The word *kill* sat on the table like something physical.

"We don't have to solve all of it today," Jim said. "We solve the first part. Watch rotation. Two-hour shifts. One person awake with a flashlight, watching the room. If someone spikes — thrashing, the sounds we know — the watcher wakes me. We assess together."

"And if the assessment is bad?" Maria asked.

"Then we deal with it. Together. In the light."

We set up the rotation that morning. Two-hour shifts, midnight to six. Jim took the first slot. Marcus took second. I took third. Dale insisted on fourth — the pre-dawn hours, his worst window, arguing that if he was going to be awake sweating through cortisol spikes anyway, he might as well be useful.

I wrote it in the notebook: *We are now watching ourselves the way we watch the Turned. The perimeter is inside the room.*

And separately: *Marcus dreams about Ava. The phone screen going dark. Three days in the cab with nothing but bourbon and a dead phone and the sound of Turned walking past the windows. He carries the dream the way he carries the phone — something broken he won't put down.*

---

I went up to the steeple after the broadcast. I needed to think, and thinking happened better with the binoculars and the long view — the park, the road, the Lyles' compound to the north, the Walmart across the interstate to the south. The October sun was low, casting long shadows across the parking lot. The Turned stood in their positions, faces angled toward the light.

Jim came up the stairs about twenty minutes later. He didn't say anything at first — just stood at the louvers, looking out at the parking lot with the expression of a man conducting a service for people who couldn't hear him.

"Tom Hadley," he said, pointing. "Third from the left. The one by the utility pole."

I found him through the binoculars. A heavyset man in a flannel shirt, face tilted toward the sun, the standard posture. Nothing distinctive.

"He directed the choir," Jim said. "Twenty-two years. Every Sunday, Wednesday rehearsal, Christmas cantata. He had this thing he did" — Jim raised his right hand, fingers together, making a small scooping motion — "when the sopranos came in. Like he was pulling the sound out of the air."

I looked again. Tom Hadley's hands were at his sides. Then — so subtle I would have missed it without the binoculars — his right hand moved. Fingers together, a small scooping motion, the ghost of a cue to singers who would never sing again. The motion lasted two seconds. Then his hand dropped and he was still.

"That's not the organism," Jim said. "The organism doesn't know how to conduct a choir. That's Tom."

I lowered the binoculars. Jim was watching Hadley the way a father watches a sleeping child — with tenderness and with the specific grief of seeing someone present and unreachable at the same time.

"Marcus asked if we could kill them," I said.

"I heard."

"If Tom's still in there — if the person persists inside the host — then killing the Turned isn't pest control. It's something else."

"It's murder," Jim said. Simply. Not arguing. Naming.

"Or mercy."

"Maybe. But we don't get to decide that from a steeple with binoculars. We don't get to decide that without knowing what he feels, if he feels, whether the Tom doing the scooping motion is a person trapped or a recording playing back. And since we can't know —"

"We don't act."

"We don't act *yet.*" He looked at me. "I'm not saying never. I'm saying not from ignorance. Not from convenience. If we ever do that — if we ever cross that line — it has to be because we understand what we're ending. Not because it's easier than understanding."

He went back downstairs. I stayed in the steeple and watched Tom Hadley conduct his empty choir, and I didn't know which possibility unsettled me more — that he was still in there, or that he wasn't and the organism was borrowing his hands for a purpose I couldn't fathom.

I was revising assumptions. You observe. You form a model. The model predicts behavior. When the behavior deviates, you revise. You don't get attached to the model. You let it be wrong and you build a better one.

My first model: the Turned are dangerous because they herd you and scare you and the fear turns you. This was true but incomplete.

My second model: the danger is biochemical, not behavioral. Keep your adrenaline down and you're invisible. Also true. Also incomplete.

The new model, after Moss's broadcast and Sienna's report from the blockade: the danger is *layered.* Layer one is the herding — the fear-farming, the conversion cycle. We'd learned to counter that. Layer two is the density threshold — the swarm behavior that makes them destructive. We couldn't counter that; we could only avoid it. Layer three — the one that scared me most — was the hunger. Sienna had seen them eating the dead at the interchange. When the easy food ran out, the Turned would expand their search. They wouldn't need to scare you to kill you. They'd just need to find you.

And underneath all three layers was the thing Moss had described without dwelling on: the organism was adapting. Getting better. The Turned from week one were clumsy, degrading, barely functional. The Turned from week two were coordinated, strategic, increasingly efficient. If the trajectory continued — and why wouldn't it — the Turned from week four or six or eight would be something we hadn't seen yet and couldn't predict.

Every model I built had a shelf life. Every answer was temporary. The organism was iterating faster than my understanding.

Ruth would have called it the Red Queen hypothesis — she had a Lewis Carroll reference for everything, thirty-nine years of teaching lodged in her brain like sediment. "It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place." In evolutionary biology, the idea is simple: in an arms race, you have to keep adapting just to maintain your position. The organism adapts, so you adapt, so it adapts again, and the race never ends.

We were in a Red Queen race and we were losing. Not because we weren't adapting — we were. But our adaptation was cognitive, social, slow. The organism's adaptation was biological, collective, fast. We were playing chess against something that was rewriting the rules between moves.

The sun went down. The Turned shifted. Sixteen faces turned toward the last of the light. Pembrook's skin, in the steeple binoculars, was visibly green now — not the grey-green of week one but a darker, almost vegetal shade, concentrated on his face and forearms. The sun-exposed surfaces. I wrote it in the notebook and drew an arrow connecting it to the sunflower observation from week one and didn't write what I thought it meant because I wasn't ready.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #6:**

*The old model said: stay calm and you're safe. The new model says: stay calm, stay below the density threshold, stay fed, stay medicated, and outrun an organism that's adapting faster than you are. "Safe" was always temporary.*

*I'm starting to think the whole concept of "rules for survival" is a comfort blanket. The rules keep changing. The organism keeps learning. The only real rule is: pay attention. Revise. Don't get attached to being right.*

*Moss said "every fortress is a countdown." She's right. But what she didn't say is that every model is a countdown too.*

# Chapter 12: Nate Tells the Lyles

On Day 12, while the Moss broadcast was still settling into everyone's models, Sienna and I ran experiments.

"Experiments" makes it sound planned. It started as watching. We were on the steeple — morning shift, the two of us — and I'd been tracking the new scrub-woman's behavior for twenty minutes. She stood in the lot, face to the sun, arms at her sides. Motionless. I tossed a pen cap through the louver. It landed six feet from her. She didn't flinch. Didn't look. Didn't register the object at all.

"They don't startle," I said.

"Drop something bigger," Sienna said.

I tossed a hymnal page — crumpled, golf-ball-sized. It hit the gravel two feet from the Turned. Nothing. A gust could have done it. The Turned's eyes didn't move.

Sienna pulled off her shoe — a canvas sneaker, one of the church donation pairs — and threw it. Not at the Turned. Near her. The shoe landed with a soft thud in the gravel, three feet from the woman's bare toes.

The Turned looked down.

Not quickly — the slow, deliberate tilt. She looked at the shoe the way you'd look at a leaf that had blown onto your porch. Then she bent, picked it up, and walked to the church's side door. She set the shoe on the doorstep. Placed it there — sole down, aligned with the door frame, the way you'd return a neighbor's misdelivered package. Then she walked back to her position and faced the sun again.

Sienna and I looked at each other.

"We're not invisible," I said. "We're catalogued."

"She knew it was ours."

"She knew it came from the building. She returned it to the building's entrance. That's — that's object association. That's memory. That's the organism tracking where we are and processing our behavior in real time."

Sienna stared at the shoe on the doorstep. "She didn't come inside. She didn't try the door. She just... gave it back."

"Because we're not a threat. We're below threshold. The organism has *filed* us." I wrote it in the notebook. My hand was shaking slightly. Not from fear — from the implications. "They know exactly where we are. They've known since Jim put the sign up. And they're choosing not to act because we're more useful alive. We're fear batteries they're not ready to harvest yet."

We spent the next hour testing proximity. From the steeple we watched Jim's morning walk — his daily circuit of the parking lot, slow, calm, passing within ten feet of three Turned. No reaction. We watched a stray cat cross the lot — the Turned tracked it, the head-turn, but didn't pursue. The cat was too small to be worth the caloric effort, apparently. Or the organism didn't categorize cats as food yet.

"One more test," Sienna said.

Before I could ask what she meant, she was climbing out through the louver opening on the east side — the one where the church roof extended out below the steeple in a flat section over the fellowship hall. I grabbed her arm. She looked at my hand, then at me, and I let go.

"There's one directly below," she said. "Ten feet down, maybe fifteen out. Close enough to talk to."

"Talk to?"

"We tested objects. We tested proximity. We haven't tested conversation." She swung her legs over the sill and lowered herself onto the roof. The shingles were old and gritty and she moved on her stomach, spreading her weight, inching toward the edge on her elbows. I watched from the louver with my heart rate doing exactly what it shouldn't.

The Turned below was a woman in a housecoat — one of the regulars, someone who'd been standing in the church parking lot since before I'd started counting. She faced the morning sun with the standard herding posture: vacant eyes, the faint smile, hands loose at her sides.

Sienna reached the roof edge and looked down. Maybe twelve feet of vertical distance and ten feet of horizontal. Close enough to have a conversation across a fence.

"Hi," Sienna said. Normal volume. Conversational.

The Turned looked up. The head-tilt. The smile brightened — the standard herding response to proximity, the *come closer, be afraid* invitation. But the woman didn't move. Didn't approach the building. Just looked up at Sienna with that patient, empty warmth.

"What's your name?" Sienna said.

"It's a beautiful morning." The woman's voice was clear. Pleasant. The cadence of someone making small talk at a mailbox. But she wasn't answering the question. She was producing a phrase — a social fragment, the kind of thing a person says on autopilot when another person is nearby.

"What's your name?" Sienna repeated.

"The kids are at school." Same pleasant tone. Same mailbox cadence. A different fragment, unconnected to the first, unconnected to the question. The woman's mouth moved the way mouths move when the words are coming from muscle memory rather than thought — the shape of speech without the architecture behind it.

"Where are you from?"

"It's a beautiful morning."

The rotation was already repeating. Sienna tried three more questions — different topics, different tones. She got six responses total, all fragments: *it's a beautiful morning, the kids are at school, have you seen my keys, tell David I'll be late, it's a beautiful morning, the kids are at school.* They cycled. The same phrases in roughly the same order, delivered with the same pleasant inflection, like a greeting card that played six messages when you opened it and then started over.

Sienna crawled back from the edge. She climbed through the louver and sat against the steeple wall and didn't say anything for a minute.

"It's not conversation," she said finally. "It's a recording. The organism kept the phrases but not the person. She's running loops from her old life — things she said so many times they wore grooves. But there's nobody choosing which groove to play. It's just... pattern. Stimulus, response, repeat."

I wrote it down. *Turned produce verbal fragments — social phrases, habitual sentences. No novel responses. No tracking of conversational context. The organism preserved the host's most repeated speech patterns the way it preserved Tom Hadley's conducting hands. Behavior without intent. Sound without meaning.*

"Jim should hear this," I said.

"Jim already knows. He just doesn't want it confirmed."

"Marcus's question," Sienna said. "Has anyone tried killing one."

"Yeah."

"If they don't react to proximity — if you can walk right up to one and it just stands there —"

"Then the question isn't theoretical. Someone *could* walk up with a sharp object and —"

"And what? We don't know what happens. We don't know if killing one activates the others. We don't know if the organism has a defense mechanism we haven't seen."

"We don't know," I agreed. But the shoe on the doorstep was bothering me in a way I couldn't articulate. The Turned didn't flinch from objects. They didn't react to proximity. They passively allowed you to approach. It was like walking up to a machine that was turned off — until you remembered that the machine was watching you, had filed you, and had returned your shoe to your door with the casual precision of something that understood property and territory and the relationship between the two.

The passivity wasn't weakness. It was strategy. And strategy implies a response to deviation.

---

I decided to go to the Lyles on Day 13.

I need to explain what this meant because "decided to go" sounds small and it was the largest thing I'd done in my life. For thirteen days I had been a watcher. An observer. A recorder of other people's actions and other people's deaths. I had theories and data and a notebook full of patterns and I had done exactly nothing with any of it except survive. Jim put a sign in the window and saved lives. I put observations in a notebook and saved myself.

And every time someone suggested I do more, I had the same ready answer: *I'm fifteen. I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds. I'm the strategy kid, not the action kid.* It came out as humor. It sounded like self-awareness. It was the most comfortable lie I owned — the one that said my limitations were fixed properties, like height or eye color, rather than choices I was making every day.

The Moss broadcast changed things. She'd confirmed the density threshold. She'd said fortification was a countdown. The Lyles' perimeter was at twenty-two Turned — I'd counted that morning — and the behavior was changing. More restless. More circling. The patient herding was giving way to something tighter, more compressed, and I could feel the threshold approaching the way you feel a storm.

Jim had tried and failed. Marcus had tried and failed. They'd tried as adults, with authority and diplomacy, and Craig had listened respectfully and dismissed them because his mental model was stronger than their words. But Jim and Marcus didn't have the data. They had a principle — stay calm — and a principle without evidence is just an opinion, and Craig Lyle had plenty of opinions of his own.

I had the data. I had the notebook. I had Moss's broadcast transcribed in my handwriting. And I had the specific, granular, observation-by-observation record of every pattern I'd tracked for two weeks — the herding mechanics, the density changes, the behavioral shifts at concentration. I couldn't make Craig *believe.* But I could make it harder for him to dismiss.

There was something else, too. I'm writing this journal to be honest, so: I wanted to go because I thought my framework was better. Jim had tried faith. Marcus had tried authority. Neither had worked. And there was a part of me — the part that had spent thirteen years being the smartest kid in the room and the least useful person in it — that thought *data* would work where faith and authority hadn't, because data was *mine*, and mine was better. The ugly word for this is vanity. The comfortable word is confidence. The honest word is somewhere between them.

"I'm going to the Lyles," I told the group at breakfast. Cold oatmeal, no milk. Ruth had insisted on oatmeal because "it's a proper breakfast" and nobody argued with Ruth about propriety.

Silence.

"Alone?" Jim said.

"I'm the one who understands the data. I can explain it in a way that —"

"You're fifteen," Marcus said.

"I know how old I am."

"A fifteen-year-old showing up at a sheriff's deputy's door to tell him he's wrong about survival. Think about how that lands."

"I have. It lands badly. But Jim already tried and Craig heard 'stay calm' and filed it under 'nice idea from a pastor.' I can show him the numbers. The count around his house, the rate of increase, the behavioral shift at density. I can show him Moss's broadcast. Numbers are harder to dismiss than theology."

"Craig will dismiss whatever he needs to dismiss," Marcus said. "That's how Craig works."

"Then at least I tried. And at least he had the information. What he does with it is his problem."

Sienna was watching me. She had the expression she got when I did something she didn't expect — surprise, quick reassessment. I tried not to think about the fact that she was watching me. I failed.

"I'll walk with you to the corner of Cedar," she said. "Watch from there. If anything goes wrong —"

"If anything goes wrong, you walk back. Slowly. You don't run."

"I know how to walk, Nate."

"I know you do. I'm saying it because —"

"Because you care about what happens to me. I know." She said this flatly, factually, the way she said most things, and I felt my face get hot and looked at my oatmeal.

"Be back before noon," Jim said. "And Nate — be kind. Craig is wrong but he's not stupid and he's scared. Scared people need kindness more than data."

I nodded. I didn't tell Jim that I had no idea how to be kind under pressure. Kindness was a skill I'd never practiced. Data I could do.

---

The walk to Cedar Street took twelve minutes. Sienna and I moved together, side by side, through the residential blocks behind the church. The streets were quiet — most of the houses either empty or occupied by Turned who stood in yards and driveways in their positions. We passed a Turned man mowing a lawn with a push mower, back and forth, the blades long since jammed with overgrown grass but his body going through the motion — push, turn, push, turn — the muscle memory of a Saturday routine playing on loop. The mower's wheels squeaked. The sound was small and awful.

At the corner of Cedar, Sienna stopped. She had a rock in her hand — a smooth landscaping stone she'd picked up two blocks back. I'd watched her pick it up and hadn't asked. Now she set it on top of the mailbox at the corner, positioning it carefully.

"If they move toward you," she said, "I bang the rock on the mailbox. Hard, continuous. They orient to the noise — thirty seconds, maybe more. Enough time for you to move. I stop, walk back. They lose interest."

The hymnal experiment. She'd been in the steeple when I dropped it. She'd been watching, and she'd built a tactic from what I'd observed, and she'd brought a rock.

"You planned this."

"One of us has to." She looked at me. "I can see the porch from this distance."

"Okay."

"Nate." She touched my arm. Brief. The second time she'd done this — the first was crossing Highway 21, when I was spiraling. Both times it broke something loose in my chest. "You're doing the right thing."

"The right thing would have been doing it three days ago."

"The right thing is doing it now. Go."

I went.

---

The Lyles' house was exactly what I'd seen from the steeple, but worse up close. Plywood over every window, screwed in, professional. The generator behind the house hummed — a Honda EU2200i, the quiet model, but quiet is relative and in the silence of a dead world even a quiet generator was a beacon. The American flag hung limp in the still morning air. The yard had been raked. The porch had been swept. Someone — Tammy, probably — had placed a potted plant by the front door, a chrysanthemum in a clay pot, orange and blooming. The normalcy of it hurt.

Turned were visible. I counted: nine in the immediate vicinity of the house, standing in the street, in the neighbor's yard, on the sidewalk across the road. They tracked me as I walked up the front path. None approached. I was moving slowly. I was, according to the cuff I'd checked before leaving, at 78 BPM. Elevated but manageable.

I knocked on the door. The plywood vibrated.

The door opened six inches, chain still on. A face appeared — a woman, mid-forties, alert eyes. Tammy Lyle. She looked at me the way you'd look at a stray dog on your porch: not hostile, but confused.

"Who are you?"

"Nate Carver. I live at the trailer park. I'm with the group at Pastor Jim's church."

"Jim's boy?"

"He's not — I'm not his — I'm with his group. Can I talk to Craig?"

She looked me over. Fifteen, overweight, wearing Vacation Bible School 2019, carrying a spiral notebook. Whatever threat assessment she was running, I was not registering.

"Craig," she called back into the house. "Kid from the church."

She opened the chain. Before I stepped inside, she looked at me — not my face, but my hands, my clothes, my posture. "Are you armed?"

"No."

"Are you sick? Fever, shakes, anything?"

"No."

"Come in."

Two questions. That was Tammy's protocol — a threat assessment, not a mimicry check. *Are you armed, are you sick.* Sensible and wrong. Craig's house was checking for weapons. Jim's church was checking for humanity. Only one of those approaches accounted for what the organism actually did.

The living room surprised me. Brett was on the couch cleaning a shotgun — I'd expected that. What I hadn't expected were the other people. A couple in their fifties sat at the dining table, the woman holding a mug with both hands, the man staring at the plywood-covered windows with the hollow look of someone who'd been staring at plywood for days. And near the kitchen doorway, a thin man in a trucker cap leaned against the wall with his arms crossed — young, maybe mid-twenties, with road dust on his jeans and a wariness that said he'd walked a long way to get here.

The bullhorn had worked. Not just on the Turned.

---

Craig Lyle was exactly the man I'd expected from the steeple: big, capable, composed. He wore his sheriff's department jacket like a uniform — not officially anymore, but psychologically. *I am the authority here and the authority knows what to do.* He shook my hand. His grip was firm. He looked me in the eye. He was everything I wasn't: confident, physical, certain.

"Jim sent you?"

"I came on my own. I have information from a radio broadcast — a scientist at the University of Arkansas. She's studying the organism. She's describing what she's found, and some of it is relevant to your situation."

"My situation." Not defensive. Curious. The way a cop listens to a witness. I respected this. I also recognized it as a framework about to collide with data it couldn't accommodate.

I opened the notebook. I showed him the count: the Turned in his perimeter, plotted by day, the number climbing from eight on Day 8 to twenty-two today. I showed him the behavioral observations: the shift from passive positioning to active circling, the increased restlessness, the tightening of the perimeter.

"They're drawn to the noise," I said. "The generator, the bullhorn. Every broadcast brings more. The count has been rising by two to three per day. At this rate, in a week you'll have thirty-five to forty."

"Thirty-five. And?"

"There's a threshold. When enough of them gather in a small enough space, the behavior changes. The patient herding breaks down into — the scientist calls it a 'density threshold.' Below it, they're strategic. Above it, they become destructive. Physically destructive. They've been observed tearing through structures — plywood, drywall, framing."

Craig's expression didn't change. He was listening. He was evaluating. Brett looked up from the shotgun when I mentioned the threshold. He didn't look impressed. The couple at the table were watching me with a different expression — not dismissal but recognition. They'd seen enough to know what I was describing. The trucker had turned his face to the plywood-covered window, arms still crossed.

The man in the trucker cap spoke from the wall. "The interchange," he said. "I came through it. On 40, east of Ozark." He looked at me. "You know about it?"

"My friend was there. She saw it."

"The soldiers were defending it. Full checkpoint — barricades, vehicles, weapons. They held it for maybe four days." He paused. "On the fourth day the Turned came through the barricades like they weren't there. Not walking. Running. Screaming. The soldiers fired and every shot drew more. The noise — the guns, the shouting, the engines — it was like ringing a dinner bell. The soldiers who didn't run got —" He stopped. "The ones who ran survived. The ones who fought didn't."

The couple at the table hadn't moved. The woman's knuckles were white on her mug. She'd heard this before. She was hearing it again and it was not getting easier.

"That's one incident," Craig said from behind me. He'd been listening. "One checkpoint, one bad night. It doesn't mean —"

"It means exactly what the kid is saying," the trucker said. "Defense draws them. Noise feeds them. Every fortress is a countdown." He looked at me again. "Your friend — she said the same thing?"

"Word for word."

Craig's jaw tightened. He turned to me fully.

"Son," Craig said. "I appreciate you walking over here. I appreciate the data. But I've been in law enforcement for twenty years. I've handled armed standoffs, domestic sieges, riot situations. I know how crowds behave. And what you're describing — staying quiet, hiding, hoping they go away — that's not a survival strategy. That's waiting to die."

"It's not hiding. It's understanding the mechanism. The organism responds to biochemistry — to your stress hormones. When you fight, when you use the bullhorn, when Brett fires the shotgun, you're broadcasting exactly the signal that draws them in and pushes the count toward the threshold. Every act of defense is accelerating the countdown."

"Every act of defense is keeping my family alive."

"For now. The count is growing. The threshold exists. When it tips —"

"If it tips."

"When." I held his eyes. This was the hardest thing I'd ever done — harder than the crossing, harder than Henderson's trailer, harder than the septic tank I didn't know was coming. Because this wasn't about my body surviving. This was about making another person hear something their brain was built to reject. "Craig, you're not wrong about any of the individual pieces. The boards work. The guns work. The perimeter works. But the system you've built is a magnet for the thing that overwhelms the system. The better your defenses, the more they come. The more they come, the closer to threshold. The closer to threshold —"

"I heard you." His voice had an edge now. Not anger — the frustration of a competent man being told by a child that competence is the problem. "And I hear what you're not saying, which is that you want me to take down the boards and turn off the generator and put away the guns and just — sit in the dark. Like your church group."

"I want you to stop drawing them to your house. Turn off the generator at night. Stop the bullhorn. Reduce the signals. If the count drops below —"

"And if it doesn't drop? If they stay? If more come anyway? Then I've given up my power and my light and my ability to defend my family and I'm sitting in the dark with nothing. Is that what you're recommending?"

Brett racked the shotgun's slide — not loading it, just cycling the action, the mechanical sound of a statement being made. "This is the kid from the trailer park. The one who plays video games." He said "video games" the way you'd say "finger-painting." "He's here to tell us how to survive? Dad, come on."

I looked at Brett. He was everything the apocalypse was supposed to reward: strong, brave, young, capable. He could run faster than me, fight harder, lift more, endure more. In every survival scenario except this one, Brett Lyle would outlive me by decades. In this one, his strengths were the mechanism of his destruction.

"I'm not telling you how to survive," I said to Craig. "I'm telling you what's happening to your perimeter. What you do with the information is your decision."

Tammy had been standing in the kitchen doorway, listening. She hadn't said a word. She looked at me now with a specific kind of attention I'd seen on Sienna's face — someone evaluating something she hadn't decided about yet.

"The count," Tammy said. "You said twenty-two. You've been tracking it?"

"Every day. From the church steeple."

"And the ones near the church?"

"Sixteen. But we're not generating noise. We're not broadcasting. The growth rate near the church is lower than near your house."

Tammy looked at Craig. Something passed between them — the compressed communication of a long marriage, an entire argument conducted in eye contact. Craig's jaw tightened. Tammy's didn't change.

"Thank you, Nate," Craig said. The dismissal was polite. Complete. He walked me to the door. He shook my hand again. "Tell Jim I appreciate the concern. We'll be fine."

The door closed.

I stood on the porch next to Tammy's chrysanthemum and felt the sting of being dismissed by a man who was wrong. Then, under it: this was exactly how Craig had felt when Jim tried. The vanity I'd carried here — *my data is better than your faith, my framework is sharper than your training* — had produced exactly the same result as every other approach. Craig's model was intact. Mine had a crack in it. Being right and being persuasive had nothing to do with each other, and I'd confused them because confusing them let me feel superior.

---

I walked back to the corner of Cedar. Sienna was there, leaning against a mailbox, watching the road. She saw my face.

"He didn't listen."

"He listened. He didn't hear."

"What's the difference?"

"Listening is receiving information. Hearing is letting it change you. Craig received the information and then his brain routed it through his existing model and the model said 'this kid is wrong because what he's describing contradicts everything I know about how to protect people,' and the information died somewhere between his ears and his behavior."

We walked back to the church. Sienna didn't touch my arm this time. She walked beside me and the space between us was comfortable in a way it hadn't been a week ago. I noticed this and filed it and did not examine it because examining it would raise my heart rate.

"You tried," she said.

"Trying doesn't count if it doesn't work."

"That's not true and you know it."

"I know it intellectually. I don't know it in my body."

She looked at me sideways. "That might be the most honest thing you've ever said."

---

I'd started dreading sleep. Not for the dreams — the dreams were bad, the trailer dream, the Knock on loop, variations I won't catalog — but for the waking. There's a moment between sleep and consciousness, maybe two seconds, when you don't remember where you are or what the world has become. Your body startles — the orienting reflex — and your heart rate spikes before your brain catches up. Two seconds of uncontrolled fear. In the old world, harmless. In this world, a conversion risk. I'd started sleeping with my hand on my pulse, thumb pressed against the artery in my wrist, so that the first thing I felt on waking was my own heartbeat, and the first conscious act was counting it down.

At the church, I sat in the steeple and counted the Turned around the Lyles' house through the binoculars. Twenty-three now. One more since this morning. Brett was on the porch, shotgun across his knees, watching the perimeter. Craig was checking the boards on the north-facing windows. Tammy was nowhere visible.

I opened the notebook.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #7:**

*Cognitive dissonance isn't a flaw. It's a feature. The brain evolved to maintain coherent models because coherent models are faster than accurate ones. A caveman who reacts instantly to a wrong model survives more often than one who pauses to revise. The problem is that we're in a novel environment where the wrong model kills you, and the brain is still optimizing for speed.*

*I don't know how to make people revise their models. Jim can't do it with faith. I can't do it with data. Maybe the only thing that revises a model is the model failing — and by then it's too late.*

*Tammy listened differently. She asked about numbers. She's running her own calculations. Whether she can make Craig hear what she's hearing — that's their marriage, their version of the prisoner's dilemma.*

*Jim said: "Being right doesn't give you the right to let him die without trying." He was talking to me. He was also talking about himself. He was also talking about God, probably. Jim talks about several things at once and you don't always know until later.*

*Day 13. Twenty-three Turned around the Lyles. Sixteen around the church. The gap between those numbers is a measurement of the difference between being heard and being loud.*


# Chapter 13: The Pharmacy Run

On Day 15, we walked to the pharmacy.

I want to describe this honestly, which means I need to tell you what a supply run looks like when the supplies you need aren't weapons or ammunition but pills that suppress your ability to be afraid. In every movie, in every game, the supply run is a set piece — tactical gear, loaded weapons, a van with the engine running. Somebody says "let's move" and music plays and people do cool things under pressure. This was not that.

This was four people sitting in a church basement for two hours arguing about breathing.

"In through the nose," Jim said. "Four counts. Hold four. Out through the mouth, six counts. Feel the exhale longer than the inhale — that's the vagal brake, it downshifts the sympathetic nervous system."

"You learned that in Vietnam?" Marcus asked.

"I learned it from a counselor at the VA in 1978. She called it 'combat breathing.' I called it prayer with a timer. It's the same thing."

"It's not the same thing."

"Marcus, if it produces the same result, it's the same thing. We've been over this."

They'd been over it. This argument ran underneath every conversation like a creek under a road. Jim and I had fought it to a draw. Marcus opted out by drinking bourbon. Dale by carving. Sienna by running push-ups until her arms shook — exhausted muscles don't produce the same stress cascade as rested ones. We all got to the same place by different roads. The organism didn't care about the road.

The plan was simple because complicated plans produce anxiety. Marcus and Jim would walk eight blocks east on Maple Street to the Ozark Family Pharmacy. Sienna and I would watch from the steeple. Ruth, Dale, and Maria would stay in the basement. If anything went wrong — if Sienna or I saw the walkers in trouble — we would do nothing. That was the plan. Do nothing. Because running to help was the most natural, most human, most lethal response available, and the plan had to account for our instinct to be decent, and the way it accounted for it was by forbidding it.

We did have one contingency. The hand-crank radio from Henderson's house was positioned on the church roof, wedged against the steeple base where it wouldn't blow off. If Jim and Marcus got into trouble, Sienna would climb out and crank it. Continuous noise, loud, from an elevated position two blocks away. The hymnal experiment had shown thirty seconds of attention from a single sound. A sustained broadcast should buy longer — enough for two men to change direction, take a side street, disappear. It wasn't much. It was what we had.

Dale, from his chair, said something that had nothing to do with the pharmacy and everything to do with the question Marcus had planted two days earlier. "What if we trapped one?"

The planning paused.

"Not killed," Dale said. His knife was moving — he was working on the turtle now, the shell taking shape in careful symmetry. "Trapped. Lure one into a room. Lock the door. Watch what it does. Does it call? Does it try to escape? Does it sit down and do the thing it was doing before, like nothing changed?" He looked up. "Because if it calls — if trapping one brings the others — then killing one probably does too. And if it doesn't call, then maybe a single Turned separated from the group behaves differently. Maybe there's something to learn."

Maria's eyes had the calculating look. "That's also how you'd test whether they can be sedated. Isolate one, administer a dose, observe the response."

Jim was uncomfortable — I could see it in the way his hands pressed together. But he didn't object. Observation wasn't killing. Containment wasn't violence. "After the pharmacy," he said. "One thing at a time."

The idea stayed on the table. Tabled, which in a small group is its own form of approval — the acknowledgment that the question deserved an answer.

Maria had argued against the mission entirely. "Jim has forty days of metoprolol. Ruth has twenty-five of atenolol. Dale has —" She'd paused, calibrating whether to say it. "Dale has his situation. We have time. Why risk two people for supplies we don't need this week?"

"Because we need them next month," I said. "And next month the Turned will be more numerous, more coordinated, and more hungry. The pharmacy is eight blocks away now. In three weeks it might be inside the perimeter of a swarm cluster. The window is closing."

Maria looked at me. She had an expression I was learning to read — the one that said *you're right and I don't like it.* "If Jim doesn't come back, we lose our moral center. If Marcus doesn't come back, we lose our navigator. You're spending irreplaceable resources on replaceable ones."

"The medications aren't replaceable. They're the only thing keeping three of our seven people below threshold. Without them —"

"I know the math, Nate. I'm the one who does the math." She turned to the pantry closet and adjusted a can of tomatoes that didn't need adjusting. "Go. But know the cost."

---

They left at 10 AM. Jim and Marcus. Two men walking east on a residential street in the quiet of an October morning that smelled like dead leaves and distant fire. Jim had one walkie-talkie clipped to his belt, volume low. I had the other in my hand, beside the binoculars.

Sienna was beside me in the steeple. The space was narrow enough that our shoulders almost touched when we both leaned toward the louvers. I was focused on the binoculars. I was also focused on the almost-touching, and it was making me worse at both.

"Your breathing's off," Sienna said.

"I'm fine."

"You're at sixteen breaths a minute. You should be at twelve."

"How do you know my breathing rate?"

"I can hear you. You're loud when you're stressed." She paused. "And when you're nervous."

I chose to interpret "nervous" as referring to the mission and not to the eighteen-inch gap between her shoulder and mine. I adjusted my breathing and said nothing and she said nothing and the silence had a lot of things in it.

Through the binoculars: Jim and Marcus reached the end of the church's block. Turned were visible — three on Maple, two in a yard on the cross street.

I keyed the walkie-talkie. "Three on Maple, north side. Two more in the yard on the cross street, east. You're clear on the south sidewalk."

Jim's hand moved to his belt — a brief acknowledgment tap, not a verbal reply. We'd worked this out beforehand: I talked, they listened. Every transmission was a risk — the radios were quiet but not silent, and we didn't know if the Turned responded to electronic sound the way they responded to human voices. So Jim and Marcus stayed off the radio unless they needed to. I was the eyes. They were the feet. The steeple and the street connected by twelve dollars of yellow plastic.

Jim and Marcus walked past the three on Maple. Steady pace. No eye contact. The Turned tracked them — that slow head-turn — and didn't approach.

Block two. A cluster of four Turned near a stop sign. I could see them before Jim and Marcus could — the elevation gave me a full block of advance warning.

"Four at the stop sign, block two. Tight cluster. Recommend the south side — give them twenty feet."

Marcus adjusted his path, giving them a wider berth — twenty feet instead of ten. Jim matched. The cluster tracked, didn't move. I could see Jim's lips moving. He was either praying or counting breaths. Possibly both.

Block three. Empty. The houses here were dark, curtains drawn. Some had doors standing open — the residents gone, fled or turned, the homes left behind with the casual incompleteness of interrupted lives. A garden hose still running, the water pooling in a driveway. A bicycle on its side in a yard.

"Block three is clear. No movement. Pharmacy visible ahead — two in the parking lot."

Jim and Marcus walked through the remnants and didn't look at them — because seeing costs something you can't afford.

Block four. The pharmacy was visible — a small building on the corner, glass front, sign that read OZARK FAMILY PHARMACY in green letters. The parking lot had two Turned in it. They stood near the entrance, not blocking it, just present.

Marcus stopped. He'd been steady for four blocks — his depression a chemical anchor — but now he stopped. I adjusted the binoculars. His hand was at his side, shaking. A small tremor.

"What's happening?" Sienna said. She couldn't see it without the binoculars.

"Marcus stopped. His hand's shaking."

"His flask."

"What?"

"He hasn't had bourbon in five hours. He rationed it for the walk — nothing beforehand, so his reflexes are sharp. But the rebound is hitting. Remember? Alcohol suppresses short-term, then the anxiety spikes. He's in the rebound window right now."

I watched Marcus through the binoculars. He was standing in the middle of Maple Street, fifty feet from the pharmacy, and his hand was shaking and the two Turned in the parking lot were watching him. Not approaching. But watching, with that tilt, that evaluation.

I keyed the radio. Kept my voice low, steady — the tone mattered as much as the words. "Jim. The two in the lot are watching but not moving. You have time. Marcus needs a minute."

Jim noticed. He turned back. He put his hand on Marcus's shoulder. I couldn't hear what he said — he didn't use the radio for it. But I watched Marcus close his eyes. Take a breath. Jim's hand stayed on his shoulder. They stood there for maybe thirty seconds — a pastor and a truck driver on a residential street at the end of the world, one man holding the other steady through touch.

Marcus opened his eyes. Nodded. They walked to the pharmacy.

---

The pharmacy had been looted.

The front door was broken — someone had put a rock through the glass in the first days. Inside, through the binoculars, I could see the mess: shelves knocked over, products scattered, the wreckage of a panicked raid. But as Marcus and Jim moved through the store, I could see what had been taken and what hadn't.

Gone: the narcotics cabinet, smashed open, emptied. The OxyContin, the Vicodin, the Xanax — every controlled substance that people knew by name and reputation, stripped clean. The antibiotics — amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin — gone, because antibiotics are the thing you know you need in a disaster.

Still there: metoprolol. Atenolol. Propranolol. Carvedilol. Bottles of beta-blockers sitting on shelves, undisturbed. Sertraline. Fluoxetine. Escitalopram. SSRIs, untouched. Clonazepam. Lorazepam. Anxiolytics, dusty and perfect. Buspirone. Hydroxyzine. The things that would have saved lives, sitting on shelves because people understood pain and didn't understand the mechanism that was killing them.

The right supplies were always there. Nobody took them because nobody knew.

Jim and Marcus loaded a bag. Through the binoculars I watched Marcus reading labels, selecting bottles, organizing by type. He was methodical now — the tremor was gone, replaced by the focus of a task. Jim kept watch. The two Turned in the parking lot had drifted to the far side, drawn by something to the east.

"Route's clear back to block two," I radioed. "The cluster at the stop sign has dispersed — one left, stationary. Recommend the same path, south sidewalk."

Jim's voice came through the static — the first time he'd transmitted. "Copy. Five minutes." The brevity was Jim: no wasted words, no wasted signal.

They made it back at 11:47 AM. Ninety minutes, round trip, for a walk that in the old world would have taken twenty minutes. Marcus came through the side door and set the bag on the folding table and unzipped it and inside were four months of beta-blockers, three months of SSRIs, two months of benzodiazepines, and a collection of anxiolytics that nobody in the church except me could pronounce.

"The narcotics were gone," Marcus said. "Everything people want to take was gone. Everything they needed to take was still there."

Ruth, descending the stairs, looked at the bottles. "That," she said, "is a metaphor for the entirety of the human condition."

Nobody argued with her.

That night Jim broke out a bottle of grape juice he'd been saving in the sacristy — communion supplies, the good kind, not the Dollar General brand — and poured small cups for everyone, and we toasted nothing and everything, and Maria said "to surviving" and Ruth said "to antibiotics" and Marcus raised his cup and didn't say anything because he was smiling and Marcus smiling was rare enough to count as a toast on its own. Dale carved a small pill bottle out of a chunk of two-by-four and put it on the shelf next to the beagle and the cardinal, and when I asked him why, he said, "Because we did a hard thing and lived, and that should have a shape."

We passed hours like that sometimes — not many, but enough. Enough to remember later. I don't narrate all of them because some things lose their meaning when you pin them down with words. But they happened more often than the fear, if I'm honest. The fear was louder but the ordinary hours were longer — the cups of grape juice, the chapters of the romance novel, the evenings where the only sound was Dale's knife and the hum of the emitter and someone breathing the way you breathe when you're almost asleep. They would outweigh the crises by a factor of ten. The journal doesn't reflect this because journals are biased toward events, and sitting together in a basement drinking grape juice is not an event. But it should be.

---

That evening I distributed the medications. Jim's metoprolol was replenished — months of supply. Ruth's atenolol, the same. I set aside propranolol for Sienna — a beta-blocker she could take before high-stress situations, insurance against her baseline running hot. I set aside hydroxyzine — an antihistamine with anxiolytic properties — as a backup for anyone whose stress started climbing.

Dale was sitting in his chair, carving. The beagle was finished. The bird was finished — it was a cardinal, I realized, the details emerging from the wood with the specificity of a man who noticed things and expressed them through his hands instead of his mouth. He was starting on something new. A turtle, I thought. Something with a shell.

"There was no Suboxone," I said.

He didn't look up. "I know."

"Suboxone isn't a pharmacy medication. It's clinic-dispensed. The nearest clinic —"

"Fort Smith. I know." His knife moved. The wood curled. "Eighteen days is thirteen now. I've been counting."

I set a book on the table between us — the PDR, the Physician's Desk Reference, brick-thick, that Marcus had grabbed from behind the pharmacist's counter. I'd been through it already, cross-referencing everything we had against everything that could theoretically touch an opioid receptor.

"I looked at alternatives," I said. "Methadone — same problem, clinic-controlled, not stocked at retail pharmacies. Tramadol — we found some. It's a weak opioid agonist. It might take the edge off the worst physical symptoms, but it won't prevent full withdrawal. Think of it as a Band-Aid on a broken leg."

"I've taken tramadol," Dale said. "It's nothing."

"Loperamide. Imodium. High doses act on opioid receptors — they call it the poor man's methadone in some recovery circles. Helps the physical symptoms. Cramps, sweating, the GI cascade. Won't touch the anxiety, which is —"

"Which is the part that kills me. In this context. Yes."

"And kratom, theoretically, if we could find a head shop, but the risk of a supply run to —"

"The risk isn't worth the payoff. I know kratom. It's inconsistent, under-dosed, and the withdrawal from kratom itself is its own nightmare." He set the knife down. "You researched all this."

"I research everything. It's the thing I do instead of being useful." The words came out before I could stop them — the self-deprecation, the joke, the deflection Sienna had named two days ago. I heard it and for the first time I heard what she heard: not humility but armor.

Dale looked at me. "The reason Suboxone matters — do you actually understand, pharmacologically?"

"Partial agonist with a ceiling effect. It occupies the opioid receptors enough to prevent withdrawal without producing a high. The ceiling means you can't overdose on it the way you can with full agonists. Nothing at that pharmacy replicates that balance. Everything is either too weak to prevent withdrawal or too strong to be safe without medical supervision."

"So there's no substitute."

"There's no substitute. There's bridging. Propranolol for the heart rate spikes. Clonazepam for acute anxiety — carefully, because benzodiazepines have their own dependency risk. And breathing. Jim's technique."

Dale picked up the knife. He was quiet for a long time. The wood curled.

"In recovery," he said, "they say 'the only way out is through.' I always thought that was cheap wisdom. Something you stitch on a pillow." He turned the carving in his hands. "Turns out it's just accurate. We bridge with what we have. Propranolol, clonazepam, breathing. And when those aren't enough —" He shrugged. "Through."

He was quiet for a while. The knife moved. Then he looked up, and his eyes had changed — something rawer than acceptance. The eyes of a man who had spent six years learning that the thing you depend on always runs out, who had rebuilt a life around that knowledge, and was now watching it happen again.

"You need to be ready for what happens if 'through' isn't enough," he said. "You specifically, Nate. Because you're the one who thinks about contingencies and you're the one who'll know when I'm past the line, and if I cross it, I need you to get the others out of the room before I —"

He stopped. The knife was still. Maria, in the pantry closet, had her back to us but her hands had stopped moving.

"We have thirteen days," I said. "A lot can happen in thirteen days."

"Yeah." He picked up the knife. "That's what I'm afraid of."

**JOURNAL ENTRY #8:**

*If you want a one-sentence summary of why the world ended: people grabbed what felt urgent and left what was actually important because the important thing looked boring and had a name they couldn't pronounce.*

*I'm starting to understand my role: the eyes. The person who sees the pattern and calls it down to the people in the middle of it. It's not nothing. But it's not enough. It's never going to feel like enough.*

*Dale has thirteen days. "Might" isn't a word I'm comfortable with when the failure mode is losing a person. He's asking me to be ready for the version where his chemistry betrays him permanently. I need to be ready. I don't know what "ready" looks like.*

---

On Day 16 — the day between the pharmacy run and the stupidest thing I've ever done — Marcus answered his own question.

He didn't ask permission. Marcus wasn't a committee person. He'd asked the question on Day 10 and nobody had answered it and the silence had been eating at him the way the flask ate at him — a low, persistent hunger for resolution. So at 7 AM, while Jim was on morning watch in the steeple and the rest of us were eating cold oatmeal in the basement, Marcus put on his jacket and picked up the hand hatchet from the tool bag and went out the side door.

I know this because Jim radioed down. His voice was flat, controlled, the voice of a man watching something he couldn't stop. "Marcus is outside. He's walking toward the lot. He has the hatchet."

I was up the stairs in thirty seconds. Sienna was behind me. Through the binoculars I found Marcus — moving south across the parking lot, steady pace, the hatchet low at his side. He was heading toward the nearest Turned: a man I'd catalogued as "Blue Polo," one of the original sixteen, who stood near the parking lot entrance facing east with the standard vacant expression and the standard wrong smile.

"Marcus," I said into the walkie-talkie. "Marcus, stop. We don't know what happens."

He didn't respond. The radio was on his belt. He could hear me. He kept walking.

At twenty feet, Blue Polo tracked him. The head-turn — slow, automatic, the same tracking they gave Jim on his morning walks, the same passive monitoring they gave everything that moved. Marcus kept coming. Fifteen feet. The smile was there. The organism trying to herd, to convert, to do what it always did.

At ten feet, Marcus's pace changed. He was no longer walking past. He was walking *toward.* Deliberately. The hatchet came up.

I saw the shift.

It happened in the Turned's eyes first — a snap, like a lens focusing. The vacant drift locked onto Marcus with a precision that hadn't been there a second ago. Then the body changed. Blue Polo dropped into a crouch so fast it looked like his strings had been cut — but it wasn't a collapse. It was a coil. Low, weight on the balls of his feet, knees bent, and his hands came up. Fingers spread. Curled. Not fists — claws, the fingers hooked and rigid, the posture of something that had hunted before on worlds that weren't this one.

The smile was gone. What replaced it was *hunger.* A focused, predatory stare that tracked Marcus the way a cat tracks a bird through glass. The face wasn't vacant anymore. It was *intent* — every muscle taut, the jaw slightly open, the eyes locked and unblinking and radiating something older than human expression had words for.

Blue Polo rose onto his toes. And he began to move.

Fast. Quiet. Not the shuffling drift of a herder — a stalking, fluid advance, low to the ground, closing the distance on tiptoes with a silence that was worse than any sound. He moved like water moving downhill. Like something for which this movement was natural, practiced, ancient.

Then the bark. Short. Sharp. A single percussive sound that came from Blue Polo's chest, not his throat — a vibration that carried across the parking lot and hit the other Turned like a switch being thrown.

Three of them dropped into the same crouch. Same claws. Same hungry focus. The nearest was fifty yards away and she covered twenty of those yards in the time it took me to process what I was seeing — on her toes, silent, hands up, fingers curled, closing on Marcus from the east while Blue Polo closed from the south.

"Marcus, *run!*" I said it into the radio and out loud and neither was loud enough.

Marcus swung. The hatchet connected — a single downward strike to the base of Blue Polo's skull, the kind of blow you give a fence post with a splitting maul. The impact made a sound I don't want to describe. Blue Polo dropped. He dropped the way a person drops — instantly, totally, the body going from animate to inanimate in the space between one heartbeat and the absence of the next.

He died like a person. The organism made him move like a predator and sound like something from another world, but he died like a man. The body that hit the gravel was a human body and the blood was human blood.

Marcus didn't have time to look at what he'd done. The three hunters were coming — fast, silent, converging from three directions on tiptoes with their claws up and their faces locked in that focused, predatory stare. Marcus turned and ran. He ran the way a man runs when the thing behind him doesn't need to breathe hard — flat out, no looking back, the hatchet still in his hand and his boots slamming the gravel and behind him the three hunters moving in that terrible fluid silence, gaining, gaining.

He made it to the side door with maybe five yards to spare. Jim had it open — Jim, who'd come down from the steeple in the time it took Marcus to cross the lot, who'd understood what was needed and been there, the way Jim was always there when someone was running toward a door. Marcus came through and Jim slammed it and the bolt engaged and outside I could hear them — not the drone, not the herding voices, but a sound I hadn't heard before: a low, continuous, focused breathing, three sets of lungs working in concert, punctuated by that bark, that short sharp coordination call, as they circled the building looking for another way in.

They circled for forty minutes. Then, slowly, the hunting posture faded. They straightened. The claws relaxed. The focused stare went vacant. One by one they drifted back to their positions and resumed the standard herding posture — smiling, swaying, faces to the sun, as if nothing had happened. As if their bodies hadn't just been something else entirely.

---

The hatchet sat on the church steps. Nobody picked it up.

The blade was dark with blood that was already drying in the October air. Marcus had dropped it on his way through the door and it lay on the concrete like an accusation. Maria was the first to address it.

"Is it transmissible?" she said. "Through blood. Through skin contact. If the organism is in the host's circulatory system —"

Nobody knew. Marcus was sitting on a pew, breathing hard, his hands on his knees. His right hand — the hatchet hand — had blood on the knuckles and the wrist. He'd already poured bleach water over it, the kind of thorough, panicked scrubbing that accomplishes everything chemically and nothing psychologically.

"We need to assume it could be," I said. "Until we know otherwise, Turned blood is a biohazard. Contact with broken skin, mucous membranes, open cuts — any of those could be a transmission route."

"We don't know that," Marcus said. His voice was flat.

"We don't know it isn't. And the cost of being wrong is conversion through a cut instead of through fear. A new vector."

The room was quiet. We'd added a new fear to the collection. Not just turning from panic. Turning from a scratch. From a splash of blood. From the hatchet sitting on the church steps.

Dale picked up the hatchet with a dish towel — carefully, not touching the blade — and carried it to the backyard. He burned the wooden handle. Maria boiled the steel head in the church kitchen's largest pot for thirty minutes. She checked Marcus's blood pressure every hour for the rest of the day. 118/76. 120/78. 116/74. Normal. Normal. Normal.

But normal vitals didn't mean safe. Not yet.

That afternoon, from the steeple, I watched what the Turned did with the body.

It took about three hours. The herders had drifted back to their positions after the hunting posture faded — all except two. These two knelt beside Blue Polo's body where it lay on the gravel, and they ate. Not frenzied. Not the swarm behavior. Methodical. Directed. The hunting mode applied to something that couldn't run. They pulled and tore with their hands, working through the soft tissue with an efficiency that said the organism had done this before, on other worlds, with other hosts. A third joined after twenty minutes, drawn by the behavior or the scent.

By late afternoon, what remained on the gravel was mostly skeletal. Bones, tendons, the durable architecture of a human body stripped of everything the organism could metabolize. The three feeders drifted back to their positions, faced the sun, and resumed the standard herding posture as if nothing had happened. The bones stayed on the gravel. Nobody went to collect them. The organism disposed of its dead by consuming them.

I watched the whole thing. I watched because watching was what I did and because looking away felt like a betrayal of the man Marcus had killed — the man who had coached Little League, the man Jim called Gary Sutton, the man whose bones were now scattered in a church parking lot because Marcus had wanted to answer a question and the answer was worse than the question.

In the steeple that evening, I wrote in the notebook:

*Marcus killed a Turned today. It died like a person. But the organism detected his approach before he was close enough to swing. At ten feet, the Turned shifted — dropped into a crouch, hands up, fingers curled like claws, rose onto its toes and came at Marcus in a stalking run that was silent and fast and nothing like the shuffling drift of the herders. The smile was gone. What replaced it was a predator. The bark brought three others and they all did the same thing — same crouch, same claws, same silent stalking advance.*

*The organism read Marcus before Marcus reached it. Not the hatchet — the approach. The deliberateness. A person walking past doesn't trigger it. A person walking toward it with intent does. The herding posture is a mask. Underneath it the organism is a predator wearing a person like a suit, and it has been reading predator approaches for longer than humans have existed.*

*One-by-one elimination isn't a strategy. You can't sneak up on something that sees you coming. And even if you land the blow — Marcus did — the bark fires before the body falls. Every kill broadcasts your location to every Turned within earshot, and the ones that come aren't herders. They're hunters.*

*The hatchet is boiled. The blood is cleaned. Marcus's vitals are normal. We don't know if that means anything. We don't know if the organism transmits through blood. We don't know a lot of things. What we know is this: the Turned can be killed. They die like people. And the organism has infrastructure-level defense against individual elimination — a defense that turns every kill into a recruitment call for something worse than what you just killed.*

*And afterward, the organism eats its dead. Three Turned knelt beside the body and consumed it over three hours. Methodical. Efficient. What's left is bones. The organism wastes nothing. The dead become calories for the living. The system is closed — self-sustaining, self-fueling, and designed from the ground up to turn every loss into a gain.*

*The organism has thought about this longer than we have.*

# Chapter 14: The Septic Tank

Two days after the pharmacy run I did the stupidest thing I have ever done, and I include in that assessment the full catalogue of stupid things I have done in fifteen years of being a person with bad judgment and worse cardio.

I went scouting. Alone. Without telling anyone.

The reasoning was sound. This is the dangerous thing about bad decisions — they often start with good logic. We needed a map of the surrounding blocks: which houses were occupied by Turned, which were empty, which might have useful supplies. Sienna had been scouting, but her scouting was instinctive and unstructured — she'd go out, move fast, come back with impressions. I wanted data. Grid squares. Counts. An asset map cross-referenced with the Turned position log I'd been keeping from the steeple. And I wanted to do it myself because I was the one who understood the data, and because the pharmacy run had made me feel smart. The PDR research, the medication alternatives, the way I'd walked Dale through the pharmacology while everyone else was celebrating with grape juice. Smart became informed, informed became prepared, prepared became invulnerable. And invulnerable is the most dangerous feeling in the world because it's the one that makes you walk into a house alone at 5:30 AM with a notebook and no exit plan.

Jim and Marcus had walked eight blocks and back. Sienna went to the military interchange. I was the one who hadn't gone anywhere except the steeple. But that wasn't the real reason I went. The real reason was vanity — the same vanity that had sent me to the Lyles, the belief that my understanding was superior, dressed up as initiative.

So I went. 5:30 AM, just after dawn. I left a note on the table — "Scouting nearby blocks, back by 8" — which I told myself counted as telling people. It did not. I left the walkie-talkie on the charging shelf. If I'd taken it, someone would have heard the click and woken up and asked where I was going, and I didn't want to be asked because being asked meant admitting this was a decision.

The first three houses went fine. That's the sentence that should terrify you. "Fine" is the sound confidence makes before it kills you.

I moved slowly. Checked windows. Marked occupancy on a hand-drawn grid in the notebook. House one, Elm Street: empty, front door open, no supplies visible. House two: Turned inside, a man sitting at a kitchen table, staring at the wall, motionless. I watched him through the window for two minutes and he didn't move. House three: empty, pantry stocked — I noted the address for a future supply run.

House four was a ranch-style place on Oak, one story, attached garage. I went through a back window that was already broken — someone had tried to get in or out before me. The glass crunched under my shoes. I noticed the crunch and didn't account for it, because I was feeling competent.

Inside: canned food in the pantry. A hand-crank radio on the kitchen counter. A set of tools in the garage. I was loading the backpack I'd brought — one of Marcus's, canvas, military surplus — when I heard the sound.

The drone. Low, vibrating, chest-resonant. The summoning call. Coming from outside, from the front of the house, from everywhere.

I went to the living room window.

Turned were coming. Not from one direction — from every direction. Walking in from the cross streets, emerging from between houses, converging on this house with the methodical precision of a net closing. I counted: five, ten, fifteen. Twenty. Twenty-five. I stopped counting at thirty because my hands were shaking and the binoculars — I'd brought them, I always brought them — were vibrating against my face.

I had made myself a data point. Thirty-plus Turned, converging on a single-story house with plywood-on-nothing walls, and me inside with a backpack full of canned peaches and no exit I'd tested. The organism had detected me — maybe the glass crunching, maybe scent, maybe the collective's pattern recognition flagging a house that had changed state from "empty" to "occupied" — and it had sent the net.

I knew about the density threshold. I'd written about it. I'd warned Craig Lyle about it. And now I was inside the threshold, watching it build in real time, and the distance between understanding a concept and being inside the concept was the distance between reading about drowning and having water in your lungs.

---

The house had no basement. The attic had a pull-down ladder — noisy. The garage had a rolling door — exposed. The back door opened onto a yard that was already filling with Turned coming around the sides of the house. They moved without hurry. They didn't need to hurry. The net was the tactic and the net was already closed.

Behind the backyard, across a chain-link fence, an older property. Overgrown. Weeds waist-high. And in the weeds, barely visible, a concrete disk — a septic tank access port. Decommissioned, probably, judging by the age of the house and the municipal sewer hookup I could see at the property line. The kind of thing you'd miss if you weren't looking for it.

I wasn't looking for it. I saw it.

My brain divided into two processes. Process one: rational analysis, calculating odds, noting that thirty-plus Turned on a residential lot was past any reasonable threshold. Process two: animal terror screaming *RUN NOW GO NOW MOVE* with a volume that drowns out everything else.

Process two won.

I went out the back door. I ran — thirty yards of gasping, wheezing sprint across the yard. I hit the chain-link fence and went over it with a coordination I did not know I possessed, fueled by the same adrenaline the organism was trying to harvest. I crashed through the weeds. I grabbed the concrete lid of the access port — it weighed maybe forty pounds, and I lifted it like it was cardboard because the body's emergency system has a turbo mode and it doesn't care about your usual limitations. I dropped into the tank.

It was partially drained. Decommissioned. But not empty — there was maybe ten inches of standing waste in the bottom, old and settled and black, and the smell was a physical substance, thick and wet and coated, entering through the nose and the mouth and the pores. My shoes sank into it. My stomach convulsed. I pulled the concrete lid back over the opening — scraping, grinding, and then dark, total dark — and I stood in human waste up to my shins in perfect blackness and pressed my hands over my mouth because vomiting is loud and loud is death.

---

Time does things in the dark.

I don't know how long I stood there before the sound changed. Twenty minutes? Thirty? The drone was audible through the concrete — muffled, felt more than heard, a vibration in the bones of the tank and through the soles of my shoes and up into my legs. Then footsteps above. Many footsteps. The collective had reached the house.

The sound that came next is the thing I don't talk about.

A roaring. Not voices — not the human sounds the Turned usually made, the mimicry, the drone. This was structural: wood splitting, glass shattering, something heavy being overturned and overturned again. The ranch house was coming apart. The swarm had hit threshold and the patient herding had collapsed into undirected destruction and the Turned were tearing through the house the way a tornado tears through a mobile home — not aimed, not purposeful, just force. Raw collective force applied to whatever was in reach.

It went on for an hour. Maybe longer. In the dark, in the tank, with the waste soaking through my clothes and the smell destroying my ability to think about anything except not vomiting, I pressed my hands over my ears and counted prime numbers. Two, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-three, twenty-nine. I counted them because they were orderly and because orderly things were the only defense I had against the chaos above me. The primes were reliable. They followed rules. They didn't change their minds or tear through walls or use your mother's voice to lure you outside.

At 89 the primes stopped working.

I don't mean I forgot the sequence. I mean the numbers stopped being a wall and became sounds my mouth made while the rest of me went somewhere else. Because the house above me was being torn apart and I was standing in human waste in the dark and I was fifteen years old and I was going to die here and nobody knew where I was because I'd left a *note*. The terror filled the tank the way the waste filled my shoes and I couldn't count around it the way you can't breathe around water.

My heart was hammering. Not the managed rhythm Jim had taught, not the four-in-hold-six-out, but the runaway cascade — 140, 150, higher, the kind of heart rate that exists for one biological purpose, which is to fuel a sprint, and I couldn't sprint because I was in a concrete box four feet wide and if I pushed the lid off and ran they would tear me apart the way they were tearing the house apart and that thought — the image of it, the sound of it translated to my body — pushed the rate higher and the rate pushing higher made the fear worse and the fear made the rate worse and I understood in a way I hadn't before that this was the loop, this was the mechanism, this was how the organism won. Not by catching you. By letting your own chemistry do the catching.

Then the warmth came.

It started in my chest. A spreading heat, not unpleasant — not the burn of exertion but something softer, like a muscle unclenching that you didn't know was clenched. It moved outward through my arms, into my hands, up through my throat and into the base of my skull. My hands stopped shaking. My jaw unclenched. For a fraction of a second it felt like relief and that was the most terrifying part — that the thing trying to unmake me felt *good.*

The edges of me went soft. The parts that were Nate — the name, the weight, the self-consciousness, the mother I was trying not to think about — started to feel like things I was holding instead of things I was. Like I could set them down. Like there was a surface somewhere in the dark where I could place them carefully and walk away lighter. The organism wasn't attacking. It was *inviting.* The gentlest thing I'd ever felt, and it was dissolving me.

I had maybe seconds. I knew this the way you know you're falling before you hit. The prime numbers were gone. Jim's breathing was gone. The analytical framework I'd built my entire identity around was tissue paper and the warmth was burning through it and behind the warmth was something vast and patient and utterly without malice. You can't fight something that isn't fighting you.

So I did the only thing I could think of. I dropped my hands from my ears, bent down, and shoved my face into the waste.

Not metaphorically. Not a splash. I plunged both hands into the black standing sewage at the bottom of the tank and brought them up to my face and pressed the filth against my nose and mouth and breathed in — a full, deliberate, gasping inhalation of the most revolting substance I had ever encountered. The smell hit my brainstem like a fist. My stomach convulsed so violently that I doubled over. My eyes flooded. I gagged, retched, retched again, the reflex so total and so involuntary that every other signal in my body — the warmth, the invitation, the gentle dissolution — was obliterated by the sheer biological imperative of *revulsion.*

The warmth shattered. The softness at my edges snapped back into hardness. I was Nate again — Nate in a septic tank, Nate covered in filth, Nate retching in the dark with sewage on his face and tears streaming from his eyes, but *Nate.* The organism's invitation couldn't compete with the body's oldest and most violent reflex. Disgust is older than fear. It's the immune system's scream, and it doesn't negotiate and it doesn't dissolve. I had found the one feeling more powerful than terror: the body's absolute refusal to accept contamination.

I was shaking. I was crying. I was wiping sewage from my face with a sleeve already soaked in sewage, which accomplished nothing except smearing it around, and I was laughing — the high thin laugh of a person who has just done something so disgusting and so desperate and so *effective* that the only response left is the sound your brain makes when it can't process what you've done.

I started the primes again. From 2. The numbers came back. Two, three, five, seven. The walls of the tank were solid. The dark was just dark. I counted, and this time the counting held, because behind the counting was the taste of sewage and the knowledge that I had been *that close* — seconds, maybe less. That knowledge was a better wall than any prime number. Cold, clenched, purposeful fear — the fear of a person who has seen the edge and will do anything to not go back.

I got to 547 before the sounds stopped. I don't know if 547 is prime. I think it is. I never checked. It doesn't matter. What matters is that by the time the destruction ended I had been standing in a septic tank for approximately three hours and my legs had gone numb and my hands were shaking so badly I couldn't have held the binoculars if I'd had them and my entire body was coated in a film of waste that I could feel on my skin like a second layer of something that was not me.

The frenzy burned out. Moss had described this — the swarm's feedback loop was self-limiting. The collective violence escalated to a peak and then the signal scattered, the coordination broke, and the Turned dispersed in ones and twos, dazed, almost confused, like people waking from a blackout. The footsteps above thinned. The drone faded. A deep silence settled — the silence of aftermath.

I waited. I waited until it was fully dark — hours after the last sound, hours of standing in the tank in the blackness with nothing to do but exist inside the consequences of my own confidence. Then I pushed the lid. It scraped. The night air hit me and I breathed it and it was the best breath I have ever taken and it was immediately followed by the worst, because the second breath carried my own smell back to me and I understood for the first time the full dimension of what I had done and what I was covered in and what I smelled like and I leaned over and vomited into the weeds and it didn't matter because nothing I produced could be worse than what was already on me.

I walked back to the church. In the dark. By memory. Moving slow, step by step, through streets I'd mapped from the steeple but had never walked at night. The Turned were in their positions but scattered thin — the post-frenzy dispersal. None approached. I don't know if this was because I was moving slowly or because I smelled like a septic tank and even the Turned had standards.

---

Sienna was at the side door.

She'd been there for hours. I could see it — the puffiness around her eyes, the rigid set of her jaw, the posture of a person who has been standing in one place holding themselves together through an act of will that has nothing left to hold. She'd thought I was dead. She'd heard the swarm from the church — everyone had — and she'd thought I was inside it.

She saw me. She smelled me. Her face went through relief, then fury, then something I couldn't name.

"Oh my God, Nate. Oh my *God.*"

I walked past her. I couldn't talk. Not because I was choosing not to — because the machinery of speech had been offline for six hours and I didn't know how to restart it. I went to the rain barrel behind the church and tipped it over myself. The water was cold and it wasn't enough — not nearly enough — but it ran over me and carried some of the waste away and I stood there in the dark while the water ran out and Sienna stood three feet away not touching me and not leaving.

"I thought you were dead," she said. Her voice was level. The level voice was worse than screaming would have been. "I thought you were inside that house when they tore it apart. I heard it. We all heard it. Ruth was praying. Dale stopped carving. Maria started counting the food supply because that's what Maria does when she thinks someone's died — she recalculates. And I stood at this door for six hours and I didn't know if you were dead or turned or —"

"I was in a septic tank."

Silence.

"A septic —"

"A decommissioned septic tank behind the property east of the house. I dropped in and pulled the lid over and stood in it while they tore the house apart."

Another silence. Longer.

"You stood in a septic tank."

"For approximately six hours. Yes."

She stared at me. The moonlight caught her face and I watched her process this — the horror, the absurdity, the specific lunacy of a fifteen-year-old boy standing waist-deep in sewage in the dark counting prime numbers while the world destroyed itself above him — and something in her expression broke and the break was not grief and was not fury. She laughed.

It was short. One breath. More of a bark than a laugh. But it was real, and it was the first time I'd heard anyone laugh since before the Turned, and the sound of it cracked something in my chest that had been sealed shut for days.

"It's not funny," I said.

"It's a little funny."

"I was standing in human waste."

"And you survived. That's —" She stopped laughing. Her eyes were wet. "That's the most you thing possible. Everyone else would have fought or run or frozen. You hid in a toilet."

"It wasn't a toilet. It was a septic —"

"Nate. Shut up. Come inside." She paused. "Actually, don't come inside. You can't come inside smelling like that. Jim has church donation clothes in the office. I'll get them. Burn what you're wearing."

She went inside. I stood by the empty rain barrel in church-donation boxers and no shirt, shivering, holding my ruined clothes in a wad. When she came back with a pair of too-large khakis and a polo shirt that said ROTARY CLUB — DOVER CHAPTER on the chest, she handed them to me without looking and went back inside and I stood in the dark and got dressed and tried to feel something other than ashamed and failed.

---

I sat in the basement. My hands were still shaking. Jim had given me coffee — the last of the instant, reheated over a candle, terrible — and Ruth had looked at me once and said "You're an idiot" and gone back upstairs and that was Ruth's version of "I'm glad you're alive" and I understood the translation.

I opened the notebook. The pages were wrinkled — the notebook had been in my back pocket in the tank — and they smelled. Everything smelled. I would smell for days. The smell would become a joke and then a reference point and then a unit of measurement. Sienna would later say, during a particularly bad stretch of the trail, "This is about 0.6 septic tanks," and everyone would know exactly what she meant.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #9:**

*Lessons:*

*(1) Never go alone. I wrote this after Henderson's trailer. I didn't follow it. The lesson doesn't work if you don't follow it.*

*(2) Always have an exit you've already tested. I went into a house I'd never been in through a window I'd never used and my only exit was a septic tank I found by luck. Luck is not a strategy.*

*(3) The swarm threshold is real. It's not a concept. It's the sound of a house being torn apart by thirty human bodies moving in coordinated frenzy with no self-preservation and no off switch. You cannot calm your way through it. You can only not be there when it happens.*

*(4) Confidence is the thing that nearly killed me. Not fear — confidence. I went because the pharmacy run worked and because working made me feel like I knew what I was doing and knowing what you're doing is the most dangerous feeling in the world because it makes you forget that the world doesn't care what you know.*

*(5) I almost turned. In the tank. The panic broke through the counting and I felt it — the warmth, the dissolving, the invitation. The organism doesn't fight you. It opens a door and waits. I stopped it by shoving my face into the waste and breathing in, because disgust is older than fear and the body's revulsion reflex overrides everything else. This is not a technique I can recommend. This is not a technique at all. It's what happens when a fifteen-year-old is out of options and discovers that the most disgusting thing in reach is also the only thing that can save him.*

*(6) If your only option is a septic tank, take the septic tank. You will hate yourself but you will be alive to hate yourself and alive is the prerequisite for everything else.*

*(7) Tell people where you're going. Take the radio. I left a note and left the walkie-talkie on the shelf because taking it meant someone would know and knowing meant arguing and arguing meant admitting I'd made a choice. A note is cowardice in written form. A radio left behind is cowardice in silence. If I'd had the radio, someone in the steeple could have warned me about the convergence. If I'd told someone, they'd have talked me out of going alone. Sienna stood at the door for six hours thinking I was dead and that is worse than the septic tank and worse than the swarm and worse than anything I've done in my life.*

*(8) Sienna laughed. In the middle of the worst night of my life, while I was standing in the dark covered in sewage, she laughed. It was the first laugh since before the Turned. I think laughter might be a survival tool. Not because it's calming — it's not, it spikes the heart rate — but because it's the sound the brain makes when it encounters something so far outside its model that the only response is to reboot. She rebooted. I needed it more than I needed the rain barrel.*

I slept that night. I didn't mean to — I'd planned to stay awake, stay in the steeple, make up for the hours I'd cost the group. But the body overrules the plan. I fell asleep on the pew in the basement, still smelling like the tank despite two more washings, and I dreamed of the dark.

Not the septic tank. Something larger. An infinite version of the same space — no walls, no lid, no bottom. Just dark, extending in every direction, and somewhere above me the sound of the house being torn apart. Not close. Not approaching. Just constant, like weather. The tearing was the texture of the world. And I was standing in it with my hands at my sides and I couldn't move, not because I was frozen but because there was nowhere to move *to*. Every direction was the same dark. Every step would land in the same place.

I woke with my fists clenched so hard that my palms were marked with crescent moons from my fingernails. Four deep impressions in each hand, the skin white and then flushing red. For a disoriented second I thought my fingers were pruned — waterlogged — and the tank rushed back and my heart spiked and I pressed my thumb against my wrist and counted. The count took longer than usual. The dream didn't want to let go.

---

The next morning Sienna came to the steeple while I was on watch. She sat down across from me and didn't say anything for a long time. I knew this silence — it was the one she used when she was choosing words, which meant the words were going to matter.

"You keep doing this thing," she said.

"Which thing? I do a lot of things. Most of them badly."

"That. That right there. The joke. The *I'm just a fat kid in a steeple* routine. You did it before the septic tank too — 'I'm the strategy kid, not the action kid.' You said it like it was a joke. Then you went alone into a house full of Turned because nobody expected you to actually *do* anything, because you'd already told everyone not to expect it."

I didn't say anything because she was right and I didn't have a joke for that.

"The note," she said. "You left a note because you didn't want anyone to argue with you. Because if someone argued, you'd have to defend the decision, and defending it would mean admitting you'd *made* a decision, and making decisions is the thing you keep telling yourself you can't do because you're fifteen and overweight and you get winded on stairs."

"I do get winded on stairs."

"Everyone gets winded on stairs, Nate. The stairs aren't the point." She leaned forward. "The point is you keep building this case — this really smart, really funny, really airtight case — for why you can't be responsible for anything. And as long as nothing is your responsibility, nothing is your fault. And as long as nothing is your fault, you never have to sit with the fact that you could have done better. It's perfect. It's the perfect defense. And it's going to get someone killed."

The binoculars were in my hands and I was gripping them hard enough that the rubber eyepieces were deforming.

"I went into that house," I said. "I made a decision. I —"

"You went into that house and left a *note*. That's not a decision. That's running away with documentation." She paused. "You're the smartest person I've ever met. You see things nobody else sees. But you use the smart to build reasons why you can't act, instead of plans for how to act better. And I'm telling you this because —" Her voice changed. Went quieter. "Because the next time you go alone and leave a note, I might not be standing at the door when you come back. And you need to decide whether that matters to you more than being right about your own limitations."

She went downstairs. I sat in the steeple and looked through the binoculars and didn't see anything because my eyes were blurring and I told myself it was the cold air and it wasn't the cold air.

# Chapter 15: Sienna Runs

On Day 18, Sienna did the bravest and stupidest thing I have ever witnessed — and the septic tank only risked my own life.

I was in the basement inventorying the pharmacy haul when she came down the stairs from the steeple moving faster than I'd ever seen her move indoors.

"There's a kid," she said. "Two blocks south. In a yard. Alone. Crying."

The basement went still. Jim looked up from his Bible. Dale's knife paused. Maria, at the pantry, turned around.

"How old?" Jim asked.

"Young. Six, seven. A boy. He's sitting in the yard of that yellow house on Birch — the one with the swing set. He's just *sitting there,* and there are Turned on the next block and he's *crying,* Jim, he's crying and they're going to find him."

I was already moving to the stairs. "Let me see."

In the steeple, through the binoculars, I found him. A small figure in the yard of a yellow clapboard house — sitting in the grass next to a swing set, knees to his chest, rocking. I couldn't hear the crying from this distance but I could see it in his body: the shaking, the way his head dropped and lifted, the convulsive rhythm of a child who has been alone too long and has reached the end of whatever reserves a seven-year-old has.

Three Turned were visible on Birch Street. One block south of the child. Walking slowly, drifting, their standard patrol. They hadn't oriented toward him yet, but the crying — even at distance, even muffled by the glass of the steeple — was a sound that carried, and if I could see him from here, the Turned's network would register him soon. Crying is fear made audible. The organism would hear it the way a shark hears blood.

"We need to get him," Sienna said. She was behind me on the stairs, and her voice had a quality I hadn't heard before — visceral, primal. This was not a strategic calculation for her.

"We need to think about —"

"He's seven, Nate. He's Jaylen's age. He's sitting in a yard *crying* and there are three of them one block away and if we don't go now —"

"If we go now without a plan, we risk —"

"Then I go." She was past me on the stairs, moving down. "I go alone. I'm fast. I can get there and back in four minutes."

"Sienna, *stop.*"

She stopped. Not because I had authority — I had a notebook and a history of hiding in septic tanks. She stopped because something in my voice caught her, the same way her hand on my elbow caught me during the crossing.

"Running is the thing that kills people," I said. "You know this. You watched the soldiers. You told me yourself — the sergeant who stopped fighting was the one who survived. If you run two blocks, your heart rate goes to 160, 170, and you're carrying a crying child, and your adrenaline is spiking because of his fear and your fear feeding each other, and —"

"I know the mechanism, Nate."

"Then you know running is —"

"I know." Her eyes were bright — intensity, not tears. "I'm not going to let a seven-year-old die because I'm managing my heart rate. I know the math. I know the risk. And I can't."

Jim was at the bottom of the stairs. He'd heard everything. He looked at Sienna and something passed between them. Jim, who had put the sign in the window. Jim, who had made coffee. He recognized what Sienna was doing because it was what he'd been doing for two weeks, and the fact that the organism punished it didn't make it wrong.

"Go," Jim said. "Walk as far as you can. Run only if you have to. And Nate —" He looked at me. "Watch. Guide her back."

Sienna took the walkie-talkie from the charging shelf. Jim took the other. He didn't go to the steeple — he stayed on the ground floor, near the side door, because someone needed to be ready to open it fast and someone needed to be in the steeple, and I was already moving up the stairs.

---

I watched from the steeple. The walkie-talkie was in my left hand, the binoculars in my right.

Sienna left through the side door. She moved south on the residential streets, fast-walking — not running, not yet, but moving at the limit of walking speed, her athlete's body covering ground efficiently. Her posture was controlled. Her arms were at her sides. She was doing everything right.

Block one. Two Turned in a yard to the west.

"Two in the yard to your left," I radioed. "They're tracking but not moving. Keep your pace."

They tracked her — the head-turn. Didn't approach. She was moving fast but not panicking. The blood pressure cuff was on her wrist; I could see her glancing at it. Managing. Measuring. The runner who couldn't run, calculating her pace against her chemistry.

She reached Birch Street. The yellow house was there. The child was there — still in the yard, still rocking. From this angle, closer now, I could see his face: dark hair, light skin, streaked with dirt and tears. Seven, maybe six. Wearing pajamas and one shoe. He'd been alone for days — you could see it in the way he held himself, the fetal curl, the complete abdication of the vigilance that even children maintain when they believe someone is coming. He'd stopped believing.

Sienna approached him. Slowly. She crouched down. She was talking to him — I couldn't hear the words. The child looked up. His face changed — the blank despair breaking into something raw and desperate, the face of a drowning person seeing a hand.

He reached for her. She picked him up.

And the three Turned on the next block turned toward them.

---

Here is what I saw from the steeple and what I did about it.

I saw Sienna pick up the child. I saw the child clutch her neck and press his face against her shoulder and I saw his body convulse with sobs — real sobs, the kind that shake the whole frame — and I saw the sound of those sobs ripple outward like a stone dropped in water because the three Turned on the south end of Birch had stopped drifting and were walking toward the yellow house with a purpose that wasn't their standard patrol.

I keyed the radio. "Three incoming from the south. Moving with purpose. You need to go now."

I saw Sienna stand. I saw her assess — the child on her hip, the Turned incoming, the two blocks back to the church. I saw the moment she made the calculation and the moment the calculation said *run.*

She ran.

She ran the way she was built to run — long stride, balanced, the biomechanics of a girl who'd trained for the 400-meter since she was twelve. Even carrying a child, even with the wrong shoes and the cracked asphalt and the two blocks of residential street between her and safety, she was fast. She covered the first block in maybe forty seconds.

"Jim, she's running. One block out, coming fast. Get the door."

Through the binoculars I watched her face. Her mouth was open. Her chest was heaving. And her expression was the thing I'd been afraid of — something beyond fear, her body doing exactly what the organism needed. I could see the flush climbing her neck and her jawline, the exertion and the adrenaline merging into a single biochemical signal, and the Turned behind her were closing — more of them now, emerging from between houses, drawn by the crying and the scent of terror, five, six, seven.

"Seven behind her. Converging from side streets. She's fast but they're drawn by the kid's screaming."

The child was screaming. Not words — a continuous wail, the sound of a child who has been alone for days and has been picked up by a stranger and is being carried at a sprint through a world that has stopped making sense. The sound carried. Every Turned in a two-block radius was orienting toward it.

Sienna reached the church's block. Fifty yards to the side door.

"Fifty yards, Jim. Door open. She's coming in hot." She was sprinting flat out and the child was screaming and behind her the Turned were converging and I could see — through the binoculars, at magnification, in the kind of detail I didn't want — the moment something changed in her stride.

A hitch. A falter. Her right foot caught the asphalt wrong and she stumbled half a step and caught herself and kept running but the stumble wasn't fatigue. I'd seen her run — she didn't stumble. She was too good, too trained. The stumble came from inside — a disruption in the signal between brain and body.

She was at the edge.

She described it to me later — the warmth. A spreading heat that started in her chest and moved outward, into her arms, her face, her skull. A buzzing, subsonic, like the drone the Turned made but from inside, vibrating through the bones of her skull. The self loosening — as if the thing that held "Sienna" together was being gently pulled apart from the inside. The organism finding the gap between body and identity and pressing into it.

She was twenty yards from the door.

Jim had the door open. He was standing in the threshold with his arms out, the posture of a man catching something falling. Sienna crossed the parking lot. The child was screaming. She was running. The Turned were fifteen yards behind — close enough that I could see their faces through the binoculars, the smooth blankness, the absence of expression that was its own kind of expression.

She made it through the door.

Jim slammed it shut. I heard the bolt. From the steeple, two floors up, I heard the bolt engage and I heard Sienna hit the floor — not fall, collapse, the controlled descent of a body that has been pushed past its limit and is shutting down to protect itself.

Then I heard something else. A sound I couldn't identify — sharp, flat, like a book being slapped against a table. Then silence. Then the child crying again, but differently now, a scared cry instead of a desperate one. Then Jim's voice, low and urgent, words I couldn't make out from two floors up.

I watched the Turned arrive at the door. Seven of them. They stood in the parking lot. They didn't try the door. Below threshold — seven wasn't enough for the frenzy. They stood and they waited and after forty minutes they drifted away.

---

I came downstairs.

Sienna was on the basement floor. Ruth had a blanket over her. The child — later we'd learn his name was Caleb, Caleb Reeves, seven years old, from the yellow house on Birch, parents gone since Day 2 — was in Maria's arms, not Jim's. That was the first thing I noticed. The second thing was the bruise.

It was on Sienna's left jaw, below the ear. Fresh — the skin darkening from red to purple, the swelling just starting. The kind of bruise that comes from a closed fist, not a fall. I looked at it and then I looked at Jim and Jim was sitting in a pew with his hands between his knees, staring at the floor, and his right hand was wrapped in a wet cloth and he was holding it the way you hold something that has betrayed you.

Dale told me later. In pieces, the way Dale told everything — carved out slowly, the details emerging one at a time.

Sienna had come through the door and collapsed and Jim had caught her and the child, and Sienna was on the floor and she was safe and it should have been over. But it wasn't over. Her heart rate wasn't coming down. The sprint, the child's screaming, the Turned fifteen yards behind her — the adrenaline had momentum and being inside the church didn't stop the chemistry the way slamming a door stops a pursuer. She was on the floor and her eyes were wrong. Not closed — open, but unfocused, the pupils blown wide, and she was making a sound that wasn't words and wasn't the drone but was somewhere between them, a low continuous moan that Dale said made the hair on his arms stand up because it sounded like the beginning of something.

Jim had knelt beside her. He'd taken her face in his hands. He'd said her name — "Sienna. Sienna, look at me. You're safe. You're in the church. Sienna." And she'd looked at him but the look wasn't recognition. It was the blank, smooth, unfocused gaze of someone whose self was leaving the building.

"Her skin was hot," Dale said. "Jim touched her face and jerked back like he'd touched a stove. And her color — you could see it. Not green, not yet, but wrong. Flushed past red into something that didn't have a name. Like sunburn but from the inside."

Jim made the decision in less than a second. Dale said he didn't hesitate, didn't warn her, didn't wind up. He just closed his fist and hit her — a short, sharp blow to the jaw, the kind of punch that comes from someone who learned to fight fifty years ago and has spent every year since choosing not to. Sienna's head snapped sideways. Her eyes rolled back. She went limp.

The moan stopped.

Maria was already there with the blood pressure cuff. She'd strapped it on before Jim's hand had unclenched. "142 over 95," she said. Then thirty seconds later: "138 over 92." Then: "It's coming down. It's coming down."

Jim hadn't moved. He was kneeling beside an unconscious eighteen-year-old girl he'd just hit in the face, and his hand was shaking — not fear-shaking, not the kind the organism produces, but the deep tremor of a man whose body was rejecting what his brain had decided to do. Ruth brought him the wet cloth without being asked. He wrapped his hand and sat in the pew and didn't speak.

Sienna came to about four minutes later. Confused, disoriented, the bruise already spreading. Jim told her what he'd done before she could ask. "I hit you," he said. "You were past the breathing. You were past your name. I hit you because I didn't know another way to stop it and I am sorry and I would do it again."

She'd looked at him for a long time. Then she'd said, "Good."

That was it. Good. The word of a person who understood exactly what had almost happened and who was grateful to be conscious and bruised and alive and still herself, and who knew that Jim had done the hardest thing anyone had done since the world ended — not the punch, which was mechanics, but the decision.

Jim was still in the pew. He didn't look up. Ruth was beside him but not touching him — present, not intruding. The group had rearranged itself around the event the way water rearranges around a stone: Dale carving, Maria counting, Ruth attending, Jim sitting with the weight of what saving someone cost when saving them looked like violence.

Sienna's hands were shaking. Not the small tremor Marcus had shown during the pharmacy run — a full-body vibration, deep, the kind that starts in the core and radiates outward. She was wrapped in the blanket and shaking inside it and her eyes were closed and her face was wet and the bruise on her jaw was a dark purple now, vivid against her brown skin, and she was breathing in the pattern Jim had taught — four in, hold, six out — but the pattern was ragged, broken by the shaking, the breathing of a person who was holding herself together with technique because everything else had failed.

I sat next to her. On the floor. Not touching. Present.

"I felt it," she said. Eyes still closed. "The edge. I know where it is now."

"You came back."

"Barely." A breath. "It's not a line, Nate. It's not a threshold you cross. It's — it's a dissolving. You start to come apart. Not all at once. The edges go first. The parts of you that are optional — your name, your history, your preferences. They start to feel like clothes you're wearing instead of skin. And the thing that's dissolving them isn't violent. It's gentle. It's the most terrifying thing about it. It feels like being invited to stop being yourself. Like the organism is saying, 'You can put this down now. You can stop carrying all of this. Just let go.'"

I didn't say anything. I knew exactly what she meant — the warmth, the invitation, the loosening — and I didn't say so because the septic tank was mine to carry and hers was hers. I sat next to her and said nothing because anything I said would be insufficient.

"I almost did," she whispered. "For half a second. I almost let go. Not because I wanted to turn. Because I was so tired of being afraid and it was offering me a way to stop. And the only reason I didn't is that Caleb was in my arms and if I let go he'd fall."

She opened her eyes. They were red. She looked at me.

"You were watching."

"From the steeple. Yes."

"I heard you. On the radio. The whole time." A pause. "Three incoming from the south. She's coming in hot." She said it in my voice — flat, steady, the voice I'd used because steady voices keep other people steady and because controlling the voice was the only thing I could control. "You got Jim to the door."

"Yes."

"And you stayed in the steeple."

"Jim told me —"

"I know what Jim told you. And I know you guided me back and I know you called the Turned count and I know you got the door open. I'm not asking what you did with the radio. I'm asking what you would have done if the radio wasn't enough."

I didn't answer. The answer was: I don't know. From the steeple, through binoculars, I'd guided Sienna through two blocks of converging Turned, and I'd gotten Jim to the door. But she wasn't asking about the radio. She was asking whether I'd have come down the stairs and run into the street, and I didn't know. At least a coward has made a decision.

"You did the right thing," she said. "Staying. Watching. Not following. If you'd come after me, I'd have had to worry about you, and worrying about you would have pushed me over. You staying put kept me below the line."

"That's rational."

"It's also true. Are you going to accept it or are you going to punish yourself?"

"Both, probably."

She almost smiled. The ghost of the laugh she'd given me after the septic tank. Then the almost-smile faded and she closed her eyes again and the shaking continued and I sat next to her and didn't touch her, and the not-touching was its own kind of contact.

Caleb was asleep in Maria's lap — she'd taken him when Jim couldn't hold anything anymore, and the boy had curled against her with the instinct of a child who doesn't care whose arms they are as long as arms exist. Seven years old. Pajamas and one shoe. He'd survived for days alone in a house where his parents had turned, hiding under his bed, drinking water from the bathroom tap, eating cereal from the box. He'd come outside because he couldn't stand being alone anymore, and that was louder than the fear. He was crying in the yard because he was choosing company over safety.

Seven years old and he'd made a choice that most adults couldn't make. Sienna had honored that choice by running. I had honored it by not running. And the organism had learned — because it was always learning — that the small, crying ones could draw the fast, brave ones into range.

I didn't write this last thought in the journal. Some observations are too ugly to record.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #10:**

*The Turned don't punish bad people. They punish brave ones. They punish the ones who run toward the crying. They punish the instinct that makes humans human — the impulse to help, to connect, to risk yourself for someone else. The organism has designed a world where kindness is a death sentence and selfishness is a survival strategy. I don't know what kind of world that is. I don't know what kind of person survives it. I'm afraid the answer is: my kind. The kind who guides from a distance. The kind who calculates. The kind who stays in the steeple with a radio and calls it "enough."*

*Eight people now. The cost of doing the right thing is 1.3 days of food. Maria was right about the arithmetic. She's always right about the arithmetic. The arithmetic is not the point.*

That evening I found Jim on the church steps. He was sitting on the concrete with his wrapped hand in his lap, looking at the parking lot where the Turned stood in their positions. The bruise on Sienna's jaw was upstairs. The hatchet blood was in the boiling pot. The two events — the punch and the kill — were sitting in Jim's body like stones, and I could see them in the slope of his shoulders.

I sat next to him. The concrete was cold.

"That was Gary Sutton," he said. Not looking at me. Looking at the lot. "The one Marcus killed. He coached Little League for fifteen years. Taught those boys to throw a curveball."

I didn't say anything. I waited.

"I watched him for three days before Marcus went out there. His hands." Jim raised his right arm, miming a motion — the wrist snap of a sidearm throw, repeated, mechanical. "Over and over. The same pitch. The organism is using his hands to repeat the motion because it's stored in his muscles, in his motor cortex, in the part of him that learned it so deeply it became automatic."

"Or the organism is just replaying a motor loop," I said. "The way a record plays a groove. It doesn't mean Gary was experiencing it."

"Tom Hadley conducts the choir. Gary threw curveballs. Pembrook stands at his mailbox. Every one of them is doing something they did when they were people. You don't think that means anything?"

"I think it means the organism has access to procedural memory. Motor patterns. Muscle memory. That's not the same as consciousness, Jim. A recording of a person isn't a person."

"At what point does the recording stop being the person?" He looked at me now. His eyes were red from the day and from the night and from the punch. "If I played you a recording of your mother's voice — her actual voice, saying something she actually said — would you tell me there's no part of her in that recording?"

The question landed wrong. He knew it landed wrong. He didn't apologize because the question wasn't about apology. It was about the line between a person and the residue of a person, and he was asking me to tell him where that line was because he'd just punched an eighteen-year-old girl to keep her on one side of it and a man he'd served coffee to had just killed a man who might have been on the other side of it and Jim needed to know — needed someone to tell him — that those two acts weren't the same thing.

"At what point does running on a loop stop being human?" I said.

Jim was quiet for a long time. The Turned swayed in the lot. Tom Hadley's hand twitched — the conducting motion, brief, automatic. Gary Sutton was gone. His position in the lot was empty. What Marcus had left on the gravel was bones now — scattered, picked clean, the durable architecture of a human being stripped of everything the organism could use. The organism disposed of its dead by consuming them. Jim had watched that too.

"At what point does killing someone who can't fight back stop being murder?" Jim said.

Neither of us won. Neither of us tried to. We sat on the church steps in the cold and watched the Turned repeat their loops and we held two positions that couldn't both be right and might both be true, and the space between them was the space where every hard decision in the next three weeks would live.

Jim stood up. He put his good hand on my shoulder.

"I don't know the answer," he said. "But I trust you to keep asking the question. Even when the answer scares you. Especially then."

He went inside. I stayed on the steps until the cold drove me in.

The next morning Ruth brought me tea — chamomile, from a box she'd found in the church kitchen, brewed over a candle. She sat across from me at the folding table and sipped hers and said nothing for a while, which was unusual for Ruth, who generally said things the way other people breathed — constantly and with conviction.

"I dream about Leonard," she said. Not looking at me. Looking at the tea. "Every night since this started. He's standing in the yard. Our yard, the house on Poplar Street. He's wearing his work clothes — the blue Dickies, the boots with the left heel worn down. And I know he's turned. In the dream, I know. His face is smooth and his posture is wrong and he's standing in the garden where he grew tomatoes for forty years, and he's one of them."

She sipped her tea.

"The worst part isn't seeing him. The worst part is that I'm *relieved* he's already dead." She said this calmly, the way she said everything — with the precision of a woman who'd spent thirty-nine years choosing words for a living. "He died in 2019. Heart attack on a job site. And every night I dream that he's turned, and every night I wake up relieved that the heart attack got him first, and the relief is — it's obscene, Nate. Being grateful that your husband died before the world ended. Being grateful that he's in a cemetery and not standing in a parking lot with a smooth face."

She set her cup down.

"I'm telling you this because you think you're the only one who doesn't sleep. You're not. None of us sleep. We just don't talk about it because talking about it means admitting that the things we carry at night are the things we can't carry during the day, and during the day we have to function." She stood. "Your tea is getting cold. Drink it. Chamomile is good for anxiety and it's better than that dreadful instant coffee."

She went upstairs. I drank the tea and wrote what she'd told me in the notebook and underlined *none of us sleep* because it was the truest thing anyone had said to me in weeks.


# Chapter 16: The Night the Lyles Fell

I watched them die.

I want to say that first because everything else I write about this night is going to be analysis — the thing I hide behind. You should know that what happened to the Lyles was not a data point. It was people dying while I watched through binoculars from a church steeple and did nothing. Three I'd met — the couple from the subdivisions, the trucker from the highway. Others I hadn't. The bullhorn had kept drawing them in — survivors and Turned alike — and I don't know how many people were inside that house when it came apart. Craig and Tammy and Brett. The couple whose names I never learned. The trucker who'd confirmed the interchange story to Craig's face and been filed under "one bad night." Maybe more. Enough to make what happened next not a family tragedy but something larger and worse.

I am going to describe it in detail because you need to see what I saw to understand the decisions I make in the next two weeks — decisions that involve other people's lives. You need to know what the threshold looks like.

---

Three weeks in. Day 21. The count around the Lyles' house had been climbing since Day 10 and I had been tracking it from the steeple with the obsessive precision of a kid who understands that numbers are the only language the universe respects.

Day 10: 22. Day 13: 27. Day 15: 31. Day 18: 38. Day 20: 44.

Day 21, 6 PM: 51.

The bullhorn had stopped — Craig had finally turned it off, maybe because of what I'd told him, maybe because the batteries died. The generator still ran. The lights still burned. The flag still hung. And the Turned still came, drawn by the residual signals — the electromagnetic noise, the human activity, the smell of food and sweat and fear leaking through plywood seams. Once a concentration starts, it sustains itself. The Turned attract more Turned the way a snowball rolling downhill collects mass. Craig could turn off every device in the house and it wouldn't matter now. The critical mass was already there. The system had its own momentum.

I told Jim at noon. "Fifty-one. The behavior's changed — they're circling, not standing. The spacing has compressed. I think tonight."

Jim closed his Bible. "I'll go talk to him."

"Jim, there's fifty-one of them around his house. You can't walk through that."

"I can walk through anything." He said it without arrogance. Simple faith, the kind that had carried him across Highway 21 every day for three weeks. And he was right — he could. But walking through fifty-one to deliver a message Craig wouldn't hear was a risk I couldn't let him take.

"What are you going to tell him that you haven't already told him?"

Jim looked at me. The sadness in his face was for Craig, for the inevitability I was describing.

"I'm going to tell him to leave. Right now. Walk out the back door. Leave the guns, leave the boards, leave the generator. Walk to the church."

"He won't."

"I know he won't. But I need to have said it." He paused. "There are things you do because they might work and things you do because you can't stand before God having not tried. This is the second kind."

He went. I watched from the steeple — Jim walking north through the residential streets, past clusters of Turned who tracked him and didn't engage, through the thickening perimeter around the Lyles' block, up to the porch. Craig came to the door. They talked. Three minutes. Craig shook his head. Jim put his hand on Craig's shoulder — the same gesture he'd used with Marcus at the pharmacy — and then turned and walked back. The Turned let him pass. Jim's calm was impenetrable and the organism had long since stopped trying.

He came back to the church and sat in his chair and folded his hands and said nothing, and the nothing he said was the loudest thing I'd heard all week.

---

It started at 9:47 PM.

I was in the steeple on night watch. The moon was three-quarters full — enough light to see the Lyles' house through the binoculars, three blocks north and slightly east. The Turned were massed around it, visible as darker shapes against the moonlit street, standing in a perimeter that was no longer a perimeter but a compression. They were packed tight — shoulder-to-shoulder in places, filling the yard, the street, the neighboring lots. Fifty-one that I'd counted by daylight. More had arrived after dark. I couldn't get an accurate count in the moonlight. Sixty. Maybe more.

The voices started.

Human voices, coming from the Turned surrounding the house, directed at the plywood windows, at the people inside.

"Craig." A man's voice. Familiar cadence — someone Craig knew, a colleague, a friend. "Craig, come on out. It's all right now."

"Brett." A younger voice. Male. The tone of a teammate, a buddy. "Bro, open up. Coach wants to see you."

They were trying keys. The way the organism had tried keys at my door on Day 2 — testing familiar voices, familiar relationships, looking for the one that fit. I could hear the voices from the steeple, faint at distance, and even from three blocks away they were wrong in a way that raised the hair on my arms. Too accurate. The inflections, the vocabulary, the specific turns of phrase that belong to specific people. The organism was using the memories of everyone who'd turned and it was deploying those memories with a precision that was indistinguishable from the real thing.

The voices multiplied. More of them joining in, a overlapping chorus of familiar names and familiar phrases, all directed at the house, all calibrated to find the crack in the Lyles' composure. I could hear — or imagined I could hear — Tammy's name being called by her sister. Brett's name in his girlfriend's voice. Craig's name in the voice of a dispatcher he'd worked with for twenty years.

Then one voice, clearer than the others, carrying across the night:

"Craig, honey? It's Mama. Come help me, baby. I fell and I can't get up."

Craig's mother. Helen Lyle. She'd turned on Day 2 — I had it in my notebook, one of the earliest entries, reported secondhand by Jim. She was eighty-one. She lived in a care facility on the south side of town. And now her voice — her exact voice, the voice of an eighty-one-year-old woman who said "honey" and "baby" and "come help me" in the specific cadence of an Ozark grandmother — was coming from the dark outside her son's boarded windows.

I don't know what happened inside the house. I will never know the full sequence — whether Craig broke first or Brett, whether Tammy tried to stop them, whether there was an argument or a silence or a prayer. What I know is what I saw through the binoculars:

The back door opened.

Brett Lyle came out with a shotgun.

---

The first shot was a flash and a boom that broke the night open. The sound rolled across the blocks between us and hit the church like a physical thing — I felt it in the steeple floor, felt it in my teeth. Brett was firing into the Turned — I could see the muzzle flash, strobe-light snapshots of the yard, of the shapes closing in from every direction.

The gunfire did what gunfire does. It drew them. More Turned, appearing from the dark, from between houses, from the blocks south and east and west, walking toward the sound with that steady, patient pace. The count spiked. Sixty, seventy — I couldn't count, the moonlight wasn't enough, they were a dark tide flowing toward the house from every direction and Brett was shooting and reloading and shooting and the shots were doing nothing except feeding the signal.

Craig came out. I saw him through the binoculars — sheriff's jacket, rifle, taking a position at the corner of the house. He was firing controlled shots, the discipline of twenty years, and his discipline was the thing killing him because every controlled shot drew more and the more he drew the more he fired and the loop was closing.

Tammy was in the doorway. I could see her silhouette. She was not shooting. She was standing in the door frame and I think — I will never be sure — that she was trying to pull them back inside. That she'd heard what I'd told them and had done the math that Craig couldn't do because Craig's training was louder than her math and Brett's courage was louder than both.

The count hit critical.

I saw it happen. Through the binoculars, in the moonlight, I saw the change. It was like watching water go from liquid to boil — a phase transition, sudden and total. The Turned surrounding the house had been in their herding mode: strategic, patient, using the voices, applying psychological pressure. Then something shifted. A ripple went through the crowd — a physical shudder, a synchronization of movement that traveled through the mass like a wave. The voices stopped. The drone stopped. Everything stopped for maybe two seconds.

Then they went insane.

Not rushed. Not swarmed. Went *insane* — the coordination that had been building for three weeks shattered into something that had no strategy and no restraint and no resemblance to the patient, calculating organism I'd been studying. They hit the house from every direction at once, but "hit" is the wrong word. They *attacked* it. They tore at the plywood with their fingers, pulling and ripping, nails splitting and fingers breaking and the fingers kept pulling. They climbed — scaled the walls like animals, finding handholds in the siding, hauling themselves up the face of the house toward the roof with a speed and a fluidity that human bodies are not supposed to have. Through the binoculars I watched a woman climb the north wall hand over hand, reach the eave, and start peeling shingles off the roof with her bare hands, tearing through the tar paper underneath, ripping at the decking boards. Her fingers were shredded. She kept going.

I timed it. Timing things is what I do when I can't do anything else. The alternative was feeling, and feeling would have meant screaming, and screaming would have carried three blocks. I could not.

Four minutes for the plywood. The boarded windows went in sequence — north side first, then east, then the front. They didn't push the plywood off. They *dismantled* it — fingers hooked under edges, pulling in different directions, the wood splitting along the grain as twenty hands tore it apart the way you'd tear apart bread. I could hear the wood splitting from the steeple — a sound like bones cracking, continuous, overlapping.

The walls went next. A man — I couldn't identify him in the moonlight — lowered his head and drove it into the brick façade on the east side. Not once. Over and over, a rhythmic battering that sent chips of mortar spraying with each impact. The brick didn't give but the mortar between the bricks did, and after six or seven blows he was pulling bricks out of the wall with bloody hands and the ones behind him were climbing through the gap before it was wide enough, squeezing their bodies through jagged openings, the brick edges tearing skin and muscle as they forced themselves through and they did not slow down. Others were punching through drywall on the interior walls — I could hear the crumbling, the gypsum giving way, and through the broken windows I could see them inside the house, climbing over each other, pulling down ceiling joists, tearing open closet doors, moving through the structure the way termites move through wood — consuming it from the inside out.

One of them reached the roof through the attic access and began tearing at the rafters from above. Others climbed the exterior and met him there. They pulled the roof apart in sections — not lifting it off but disassembling it, rafter by rafter, sheathing board by sheathing board, with the methodical frenzy of something that didn't know how to stop. A roof section collapsed and fell into the house and took six of them with it and the ones it fell on kept moving under the debris, still tearing, still pulling, broken arms still swinging at the framing around them. One crawled out from under a section of ridge beam with his ribcage visibly deformed — the ribs on his left side pushed inward, the chest wall caved — and he got up and went back to the wall he'd been pulling apart. The organism didn't register damage. The body was a tool and the tool was expendable.

They attacked each other. Not deliberately — incidentally, the way you'd shove through a crowd that was in your way. When two Turned reached for the same section of wall, they fought for it — clawing, biting, shoving — and the one that lost didn't retreat. It turned on the nearest surface and kept destroying. I watched through the binoculars as a Turned woman pulled a man off a window frame by the shoulders, threw him to the ground, and went through the window herself. The man got up with a dislocated shoulder — the arm hanging wrong, swinging loose — and started battering the wall beside the window with his good arm, then his bad arm, then his head.

Brett's shotgun fired three more times during the breach. Each blast knocked a Turned backward — I saw the impacts through the binoculars, the bodies jerking, falling — and the ones that fell got up. Not all of them. Some didn't get up. But the ones that did got up with holes in them and kept coming, and the ones that didn't were trampled by the ones behind them, and then the shotgun stopped.

Craig's rifle fired once.

Then nothing. Just the sound.

The sound was the worst part. The destruction had a rhythm, a tempo, the mechanical beat of a demolition. The sound underneath it was human. The Turned weren't speaking anymore, weren't using names. They were making sounds that had no words: grunts, impacts, the wet tearing of materials that might have been wood and might not have been, and underneath it all a continuous low vibration, subsonic, felt in the steeple floor more than heard, as if the collective itself was humming at a frequency below language.

The generator exploded at 10:31 PM. The fuel tank ruptured when the east wall came down — a flash, brief and orange, and then darkness. The fire didn't spread. There wasn't enough structure left to burn. The sounds continued in the dark — but they were changing. The tearing became less rhythmic, more scattered. The frenzy was burning itself out, the Turned running down like machines that had exhausted their fuel. The last sounds were individual — a single set of hands still pulling at something in the rubble, then stopping. Then silence.

---

I sat in the steeple until dawn.

I didn't go downstairs. I didn't tell anyone. They knew — they'd heard the sounds, the gunfire, the collapse. Sienna came to the stairs twice and I heard her and didn't answer and she didn't come up. She understood I needed to be alone.

Sometime before dawn I must have dozed, because Craig was alive. He was on the bullhorn, standing on his porch, and the words coming out were my rules — "Stay calm. Stay small. Stay quiet." — but read backward, scrambled, the syntax inverted so the meaning collapsed in on itself. "Quiet stay. Small stay. Calm stay." He was grinning — the wrong grin, the Turned grin — and reading from my notebook, holding it up, and the pages were blank. He read the blank pages into the bullhorn and the sound that came out was the drone, the summoning call, and the Turned were coming from every direction but they were coming toward *me*, toward the steeple, and the steeple was swaying —

I jerked awake. My hand went to my wrist. One hundred and six. I pressed my back against the louver frame and counted it down in the cold air, watching my breath cloud, watching the parking lot below where the Turned stood in their positions, watching the Lyles' house — the dark shape three blocks north — and the house was still standing and for one disoriented second I thought it hadn't happened yet, that the dream was the memory and the memory was the dream, and then the second passed and the house was rubble and the flag was in the mud and I was awake and Craig was dead and the steeple was not swaying.

At first light I raised the binoculars.

The Lyles' house was gone. Not damaged — gone. The structure had been reduced to a debris field: lumber, drywall, roofing, the wreckage of a life scattered across a lot and into the street. The American flag was in the mud, trampled, half-buried in plaster dust. The chrysanthemum — Tammy's chrysanthemum, in its clay pot by the front door — was crushed under a section of wall framing. The generator was a blackened ruin. The plywood was splinters.

The Turned had scattered. Post-frenzy dispersal — the same pattern I'd observed after the ranch house incident, but on a larger scale. They milled in the debris, dazed, their coordination dissolved, individuals drifting without purpose.

The damage was extraordinary. Through the binoculars I could see the cost of what the swarm had done to itself. A woman sat in the rubble with both arms broken below the elbow — the forearms bent at angles that made my stomach clench — and she was trying to stand and couldn't because her arms couldn't push her up and she kept trying, the broken limbs folding under her weight, and the organism kept making her try. A man stood near the remains of the porch with his jaw hanging loose on one side, dislocated or broken, the lower teeth visible in a way they shouldn't have been. Others had torn hands, crushed fingers, scalps split open from battering brick, chest walls caved from being buried under debris. One — the headbatter from the east wall — stood swaying with his forehead caved in, the skull visibly deformed, and he was still upright, still blinking, still tracking movement. The organism maintained function. It didn't maintain the body.

At least twenty of them were on the ground. Not standing. Not moving. Lying in the debris with the stillness that means nothing is operating anymore — the blood loss too great, the internal damage too severe, the ribs that had broken inward finally cutting the arteries they'd been grinding against for an hour. They'd destroyed themselves against the house the way moths destroy themselves against a light, and the destruction hadn't registered as a reason to stop. The frenzy had run until the bodies failed.

The ones that were still moving had noticed the ones that weren't.

I watched through the binoculars and I want to tell you I looked away but I didn't. A Turned man — one of the less damaged ones, a scrape across his forehead but otherwise functional — knelt beside a body in the rubble. The body was a woman who'd fallen from the roof. Her neck was at a wrong angle. The man knelt and he began to eat.

Not frantically. Not the frenzy. This was the hunting behavior — directed, purposeful, caloric. He ate the way a predator eats, pulling and tearing with the same hands that had torn the plywood an hour ago, and two others joined him within minutes, drawn by the behavior or the smell or whatever signal the organism used to coordinate feeding. They ate methodically. Efficiently. The organism wasting nothing.

Across the debris field, the same thing was happening in three other places. The living Turned consuming the dead ones. The swarm's own casualties becoming the swarm's next meal. By the time the sun was fully up, the bodies on the ground were being reduced — not to nothing, not yet, but to less. The soft tissue going first. The bones last.

The organism had designed a system with no waste. The frenzy destroyed the structure. The frenzy destroyed some of the Turned. The survivors ate the destroyed. The calories fueled the next cycle. I was watching a closed loop, self-sustaining, and the efficiency of it was the most horrifying thing I'd seen since the world ended because it meant the organism hadn't made a mistake. The self-destruction wasn't a flaw. It was a feature. The swarm was designed to lose bodies, and the bodies were designed to be consumed, and the whole thing ran like a machine that burned its own parts for fuel.

I saw new faces among the survivors. Craig, still in his sheriff's jacket, standing in his own front yard with blank eyes and a smooth face. Brett, shirtless, blood on his arms that wasn't his, drifting toward the road. The trucker — I recognized the cap — standing motionless near what had been the porch. Others I couldn't identify at distance.

I didn't see Tammy. I didn't see the couple from the subdivisions.

I looked for her. I scanned the debris, the yard, the street — dead or turned. I couldn't find her. The house was too thoroughly destroyed, the debris too scattered. She was in there somewhere, or she'd turned and I couldn't identify her at distance, or she'd gotten out. While Craig and Brett were drawing the swarm's attention at the back door, she'd gone through the front. While the organism was focused on the guns and the shouting, she'd walked away. Slowly. Quietly. The way I'd walked back from Henderson's trailer. The way I walked everywhere now.

I had no evidence for this. Tammy had listened when I talked. She'd asked the right questions. She'd looked at Craig with the expression of a woman doing math her husband couldn't hear. Maybe the math had saved her. Maybe it hadn't.

I came down from the steeple at 7 AM. The group was in the basement. Jim was sitting with his head bowed. Ruth was reading her Bible — the pocket King James, not her novel — reading it the way people read when they need something and don't know what. Dale was carving. The turtle was nearly finished. Caleb was asleep on a pew, curled around the beagle Dale had given him.

Sienna looked at me. I looked at her. I sat down on a folding chair and I put my head in my hands and I stayed like that for a long time and nobody spoke because there was nothing to say that was equal to what we'd heard in the night.

When I raised my head, Marcus handed me a cup of water and said "Drink this" in the tone of voice you use with someone in shock. I drank it. It tasted like nothing.

"Craig and Brett turned," I said. "The trucker too. I couldn't find Tammy, or the couple."

"Maybe she got out," Sienna said.

"Maybe."

Silence.

"We need to move," I said. "Not today. But soon. The swarm attracted Turned from a wide radius — they came from blocks we thought were stable. The redistribution will settle but the net density in this area just increased. And the church is the second-largest structure they haven't breached."

Jim looked up. His eyes were red. "Not today."

"Not today. But soon, Jim. We have to talk about this."

"Not today."

I let it go. Jim needed a day. We all needed a day. The Lyles deserved at least that — one day where the people who'd witnessed their death weren't already using it as a variable in a logistics equation.

I went to the steeple and sat in my observation post and opened the notebook and didn't write anything for a long time. Then I wrote two things.

The first was the one I'd show people:

**JOURNAL ENTRY #11:**

*I think I'm in charge now. Not like a leader — like the kid in group projects who ends up doing everything because nobody else will. The apocalypse is the worst group project of all time.*

The second I didn't show anyone. It arrived while I was watching the roof come down, and it wasn't grief. It was analysis.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #11b (private):**

*When the swarm hit the Lyles' house, the roof section collapsed and took out at least six of them. They don't protect themselves. They don't dodge. They don't notice when the thing they're tearing apart falls on them. The frenzy makes them destroy everything in reach and "everything in reach" includes each other.*

*I keep thinking about this. What if the space they were in was worse? What if the structure was weaker, or heavier, or positioned over terrain that didn't forgive a collapse? The quarry off Route 7 — the one with the gravel cliffs that are always sloughing off sections. You wouldn't need to fight them. You'd just need to get enough of them in the wrong place and let physics do the rest.*

*And then I think about Marcus. Marcus approached one with intent and it saw him coming. It shifted — dropped into that hunting crouch, the claws, the bark — before he was close enough to swing. Craig used a bullhorn and brought hundreds of swarmers. The organism responds to threat at every scale. Individual approach triggers hunting. Collective noise triggers swarming. But both responses are predictable. The organism can't NOT respond. It's hardwired.*

*The interchange overpass. Sixty feet above the highway. The razor wire around the National Guard checkpoint on Route 7. If you could make them come to a place where coming was the thing that killed them — where the response they couldn't suppress was the weapon — you wouldn't need a hatchet. You wouldn't need to get within ten feet. You'd just need them to arrive, and arriving would be enough.*

*I don't want to be thinking about this. But I am. Nobody else will, because it requires you to look at forty human beings — people with names, with families — and calculate the mechanics of their destruction. I can do this. I don't know what that says about me. I'm afraid it says the true thing.*

# Chapter 17: Committee Meeting

Two days after the Lyles, we held a meeting that lasted four hours and resolved almost nothing, because the apocalypse has not simplified human social dynamics even slightly.

The meeting was in the basement. Eight people around a folding table: Jim at the head because he was the pastor and it was his church and some structures persist even when the world they were built for doesn't. Ruth to his right, Bible on the table in front of her like a gavel. Marcus to his left, flask in his jacket but not out — he hadn't drunk in two days, the pharmacy's anxiolytics replacing the bourbon in a transition Maria had orchestrated whether Marcus wanted her to or not. Dale and Maria together, Dale's hands empty because he'd left the carving in the sanctuary with Caleb, who was building a small zoo of wooden animals on a pew. Caleb had two jobs now — the zoo and the chickens. We'd found them three days after Sienna brought him in: three hens in a backyard coop two houses down on Birch, alive and indignant, surviving on weeds and beetles and the grit of animals too stupid to know the world had ended. Caleb fed them every morning — scraps from the pantry, water from the rain barrel — with the solemn focus of a surgeon. He'd named them Triceratops, Steggy, and Rex. The names were non-negotiable. The chickens did not care what they were called. They cared about the scraps. Caleb cared about being needed by something that wasn't afraid of him, and the chickens provided this because chickens are afraid of everything except the person holding food.

I had, briefly, tried to discuss the chickens' tactical applications with Sienna. The organism responded to sound; chickens produced sound involuntarily and at volume; therefore, a chicken released at a strategic distance could function as an auditory decoy, drawing Turned attention while —

Sienna looked at me the way you look at someone who has suggested using a child's pets as military ordnance. She didn't say anything. She just looked. Then she walked away. The conversation was over.

I stand by the logic. The logic was sound. I am never bringing it up again.

Sienna across from me, her chair pushed back slightly, one foot on the floor, the posture of someone who might need to stand up quickly.

And me. At the end of the table with the notebook and a pen and the binoculars hanging from my neck because they lived there now.

"We need to talk about leaving," I said.

Jim's jaw tightened. "We discussed this."

"We postponed this. I gave you two days. We need to talk about it now, because the situation has changed and the change isn't in our favor."

I opened the notebook. I'd prepared for this — drawn a diagram, assembled the observations, organized the argument the way you'd organize a presentation. Persuading people to leave the only safe place they'd known for three weeks required data.

"Four things have changed since the Lyles fell."

---

**One.** The Turned count near the church was rising.

"The swarm that hit the Lyles drew Turned from at least a six-block radius. After the frenzy burned out, they dispersed — but they didn't go back where they came from. They redistributed. The net effect is a higher density across this entire neighborhood. Before the Lyles, we had sixteen in our immediate area. As of this morning, twenty-three. The Lyles' swarm didn't just destroy their house. It seeded our perimeter."

Ruth: "You're saying their death made us less safe."

"Their death made everyone in this area less safe. The Turned don't go home. They redistribute according to caloric availability and habitat, and this neighborhood has both — the Walmart, the gardens, the dumpsters, the water sources. Every day the density increases. We're on the same trajectory the Lyles were. We're just earlier on the curve."

---

**Two.** The Turned's behavior was changing.

"They're not just herding anymore. I've been watching the patrol patterns from the steeple and they've shifted. Two weeks ago, the Turned near the church drifted — aimless circuits, no apparent purpose. Now they're checking doors. Systematically. A Turned man I've been tracking — the one in the Carhartt jacket, from across Highway 21 — spent thirty minutes yesterday working his way down the block, pushing on every door, testing every window. He's shed the jacket entirely now — bare from the waist up, the jacket folded on the ground near his usual position. The organism folded it. Whatever is driving them to remove clothing, it's deliberate, not decay."

I turned a page.

"When he found an unlocked door, he went inside. He was inside for about ten minutes. He came out carrying something — I couldn't see what. Food, probably. And here's the thing that changes the model: when he came out, he made a sound. The same sound Sienna described at the interchange — a short, sharp bark. Two other Turned, a block away, immediately oriented and moved toward the house. They went inside. The three of them foraged together for another twenty minutes."

"That's coordination," Marcus said. "That's not the herd behavior."

"No. I'm calling it *hunting.*" The word sat in the room and everyone knew it was the right one. "Three modes now. Herding — fear-farming, reproduction. Swarming — density threshold, demolition. And hunting — food-driven, directed, problem-solving. Small groups, coordinated by that sound. Herding is patient. Swarming is chaos. Hunting is directed, purposeful, and triggered by caloric need."

I turned another page.

"Yesterday afternoon, I watched a Turned woman kill a cat in the parking lot."

The table was quiet.

"A stray. Tabby. It had been living in the dumpster enclosure. She cornered it — methodically, between the dumpster and the fence — and she killed it and she ate it. Not frenzied. Not the swarm behavior. Hunting. A single Turned individual solving a caloric problem." I paused. "The cat scratched her. Clawed her arm, deep. And when it scratched her, she made the bark — that same short sharp sound — and the Carhartt man, fifty yards away, turned and started walking toward her. She'd been attacked and the sound came out like a reflex. Like a dinner bell and a distress call at once. He arrived, saw the cat was dead, and went back to his patrol. But the implication —"

"If you fight one of them," Sienna said, "the sound brings more."

"And the ones that come aren't herding. They're hunting. Directed, aggressive, food-motivated. Every act of self-defense against a single Turned potentially activates every Turned within earshot as hunters."

Dale's empty hands were still.

"The Walmart is nearly stripped. The gardens are eaten. The garbage has been picked through. The easy food is running out. When the easy food is gone — and it's going, faster than I expected — hunting becomes the primary behavior. Not herding, not swarming. Hunting. And hunting doesn't require them to scare you. It doesn't require your adrenaline. It just requires them to find you."

Maria, from her chair: "You're saying the medication doesn't protect us from this. The beta-blockers keep us below conversion threshold. They don't do a thing against something that wants to *eat* us."

"Exactly. Conversion and predation are different threats and we've been treating them as one, and the error is going to cost us if we don't update the model."

---

**Three.** The adaptation clock.

"The Turned are getting smarter. Not individually — collectively. The organism's coordination is tighter every week. Three weeks ago, the Turned near the church stood in their positions like mannequins. Now they patrol. They check doors. They forage in organized rotations. Last week the Carhartt man found the church's rain barrel and drank from it for five minutes, and when he was done he went back to his position. He knows where our water is. He knows where we are."

Jim: "He's always known where we are."

"He's always known we're here. What's changed is that he's acting on it. The organism is moving from passive awareness to active engagement, and the engagement isn't about fear anymore. It's about resource optimization. We are a resource."

---

**Four.** The medication clock.

"Jim has thirty days of metoprolol at current dose. Ruth has eighteen days of atenolol. The pharmacy run bought time, but not enough — and there isn't another pharmacy in safe range. Dale's Suboxone is at ten days. When it runs out, his withdrawal will spike his catecholamines and he'll need to be managed with propranolol and benzodiazepines, which are stopgaps, not solutions. The medications are a bridge. We need the bridge to reach somewhere."

I closed the notebook.

"Dr. Moss is in Fayetteville. She has data. She has medication — she's mentioned a supply in her broadcasts. She has a frequency that disrupts the Turned's coordination. She has the one thing we don't have: a plan beyond next week. Every day we stay here, every clock gets closer to zero. The density rises. The food depletes. The medications diminish. The organism adapts. We can stay and watch the numbers converge, or we can go."

---

The discussion took three hours.

I'm not going to recount all of it because most of it was circular — frightened people trying to reach consensus about a terrifying decision. Every objection looped back to the same core: *here is safe and out there is not.* And every response looped back to the same counter: *here is safe now and won't be soon.*

Before the leaving debate consumed everything, Marcus put the kill question on the table. Formally, this time.

"I answered my own question," he said. "You can kill them. They die like people. But you can't kill them *quietly.*"

He described it for the people who hadn't watched from the steeple — the approach, the shift, the hunting crouch. Dale's hands were still. Ruth's novel was closed. Jim listened with his eyes down.

"The organism detected me before I was in range," Marcus said. "Ten feet out, the thing changed. Dropped into a crouch, hands up like claws, came at me on tiptoes — fast, silent. Not the shuffling. Something else entirely. Then it made a sound — the bark — and three more shifted into the same thing. Four predators, closing on me from different angles. I got one. I almost didn't get back."

"So one-by-one elimination is off the table," Maria said.

"It's worse than off the table. It's a recruitment strategy. Every kill triggers the bark. The bark converts every herder in earshot into a hunter. You go out to reduce their numbers and you increase the number of the *worst kind.*"

"What about trapping?" Dale asked. He hadn't forgotten. "Isolate one, contain it, study it."

"The approach triggers the shift," I said. "If you're walking toward one with intent — with a rope, a net, anything that signals 'I'm here to interact with you' — it reads the approach the same way it read Marcus. The organism doesn't distinguish between killing intent and capturing intent. It distinguishes between passive proximity and deliberate approach."

"So we can't kill them and we can't catch them," Ruth said. "What exactly can we do?"

Maria leaned forward. Her voice had the quality it got when she'd finished calculating and was about to deliver the answer. "We can use them."

The table was quiet.

"Every behavior they have is a response to a stimulus. Herding responds to human proximity and fear. Hunting responds to the bark and to deliberate approach. Swarming responds to density. Every response is predictable. Every predictable response is a lever." She looked around the room. "The question isn't 'can we kill them.' The question is 'can we make their own behavior work against them.' Craig tried to fight them with guns and the fighting is what killed him. But what if you didn't fight? What if you just... arranged the furniture?"

The room was processing this — shifting from "can we destroy them?" to "can we redirect them?" Maria had arrived at the same place I'd reached in the steeple, watching the roof come down. Different direction: behavioral engineering instead of physics.

"She's right," I said. "The organism is predictable. It responds to stimulus the way a machine responds to inputs. If we map the inputs — sound triggers herding attraction, deliberate approach triggers hunting, density triggers swarming — then we can manipulate the outputs. We don't need to be stronger than them. We need to be smarter about where we put them."

Jim looked at me. He didn't say anything. But I could see him holding two things at once: the grief for what we were discussing and the recognition that discussing it might be the thing that kept his congregation alive.

We moved on. We formalized four protocols — four, not three. The first was the question of approach.

"Can we kill them?" was answered: yes, but the cost is catastrophic. "Can we trap them?" was answered: probably not without triggering the hunting response. "Can we use their behavior?" was answered: maybe. That "maybe" was the most useful word we'd produced in three weeks.

The second was newcomer verification — if we encountered survivors on the trail. Jim's coffee method, refined. The first gate was conversation at distance — twenty feet, no closer. Sienna's rooftop experiment had proved the Turned couldn't sustain real dialogue; they produced fragments, habitual phrases from their old lives, but couldn't track context or generate novel responses. Three questions was usually enough. If the person answered like a person — tracking the thread, responding to content, adjusting tone — you moved to gate two: fine motor tasks up close. Sipping from a cup, adjusting grip as the liquid cooled, the micro-corrections that degraded in Turned. Two gates. Anyone who cleared both was probably still a person.

The third was the watch rotation callback. "The watch rotation is the most important job we have," Jim said, "and nobody wants to do it because nobody wants to be the person who has to decide, in the dark, whether the person in the next pew is still a person." On the trail, with no basement and no walls, the watch would be even more critical. We'd sleep in shifts. The watcher would have the cuff and a flashlight and the worst job in the world.

The fourth was distraction doctrine. I laid out what we knew by type: "Herding Turned respond to sound and light — any stimulus that might mean a panicking human. A continuous noise draws them and holds their attention for thirty seconds to a minute. Hunters are harder — directed, problem-solving, noise works only briefly because they're already locked on a target. And swarmers are beyond distraction. Once the density threshold tips and the frenzy starts, you can bang every pot in a kitchen and they won't hear you over their own destruction." The hand-crank radio would travel with us. Standard procedure for any high-risk movement: position a noise source away from the group's path before proceeding.

The loops intersected and diverged and re-intersected and at one point Ruth and Maria had a disagreement about food rationing that was actually a disagreement about whether leaving was an act of courage or an abandonment of everything they'd built, and at another point Dale said "I'll go wherever you need me to go" in a voice that was so flat and so steady that I realized he was already grieving his Suboxone and had made his peace with whatever came after, and that Dale's version of bravery was quieter and harder than any version I'd encountered.

Jim opposed leaving.

Not on tactical grounds — Jim understood the math. He opposed it because the church was his church and the neighborhood was his congregation and the Turned who drifted through the parking lot were people he had known, had baptized, had buried their parents and married their children, and leaving felt like abandoning them. Even the Turned ones. Especially the Turned ones.

"They're still people," he said. "Somewhere inside, they're still —"

"Jim." Marcus. Blunt, because Marcus was always blunt, and blunt was what Jim needed. "You're asking eight living people to stay and die so you can keep vigil over people who are already gone."

Jim's face went still. The expression of a man who has been told a true thing he'd been praying would not be said aloud.

"They're not gone," he said. Quiet now. "The organism is using them. But they're still in there. Their memories. Their voices. The things they knew and loved — the organism uses those things, which means they're still present, which means —"

"Which means the organism is a parasite and the hosts are not the parasite. Jim, I know. But a vigil doesn't save them and it won't save us and you know this. You knew it before I said it."

Jim sat very still. The basement was silent. Ruth's hand was on the table near his, not touching, present.

"I know," Jim said. And the two words cost him something I could see — a sagging, the weight of a concession that contradicted thirty years of pastoral conviction. He wasn't surrendering his faith. He was surrendering the part that said staying was the same as caring.

"When?" he said.

I looked at Sienna. She'd been quiet through most of the meeting — sitting on her instinct to act, letting the discussion happen. She looked back at me and I saw the same calculation I was running: how many days to prepare, how many days the clocks would allow.

"Three days," I said. "We need to plan the route, pack supplies, prepare Caleb. Three days."

"Where?" Marcus said. Though he already knew.

"Fayetteville. The University of Arkansas. Dr. Moss. Sixty miles through the Boston Mountains."

"That's insane," Marcus said.

"Yes."

"It's the best option."

"Yes."

He nodded. He didn't reach for the flask that wasn't there anymore. He just nodded, and the nod was the closest Marcus ever came to enthusiasm.

---

That night, after the meeting, I couldn't sleep. I went to the steeple. The moon was up and the Turned were in their positions and the night was cold — early November now, frost on the gravel, my breath visible. I sat in the observation post with the binoculars around my neck and the notebook on my knees and I didn't write anything. I just sat.

Below me, in the basement, I heard voices. Jim and Marcus, talking quietly. I didn't mean to eavesdrop. The steeple's acoustics funneled sound up from the stairwell, and their voices carried.

"That kid sees things I don't," Jim said. "I've been a pastor for thirty years and a soldier before that and he's connecting dots I can't even find."

"He's got no skin in being wrong," Marcus said. "No reputation. No training telling him what the answer's supposed to be. He just looks at the thing and describes what it is."

A pause. Jim's voice, quieter: "I've spent my whole life thinking I knew what courage looked like. He's making me wonder if I ever did."

Marcus: "Courage isn't what he's got. What he's got is something else. He can look at a bad situation and not flinch. Most people flinch. Most people's brains protect them from seeing how bad it is. His doesn't. I don't know if that's a gift or a wound."

"Maybe both."

"Maybe both."

I sat in the steeple and I didn't move and I didn't make a sound because the thing they were describing was the thing I was most afraid of. The thing in me that could watch the Lyles' house come apart and think about quarries.

The cold settled over me. Below, the Turned shifted in the parking lot, restless, hungry, learning. Twenty-three of them now. Twenty-three and counting.

In three days we'd leave this church and walk sixty miles through the worst terrain in the state: a seventy-two-year-old woman, a seven-year-old boy, a man in withdrawal, a pastor whose faith was cracking, a truck driver who missed his daughter, a girl who ran toward crying children, and me — a hundred and eighty pounds, winded on stairs, capable of looking at a house full of dead people and calculating the load-bearing capacity of a gravel cliff.

This was the team. God help us.

# Chapter 18: The Map

## ACT THREE: THE WALK
### *"The hardest thing I've ever done was go slow."*

---

Marcus spread a road map on the church floor.

An actual paper map — an Arkansas Department of Transportation fold-out from 2019, retrieved from the glove box of his truck two blocks east. The internet was a memory. GPS was a memory. The satellites were still up there, orbiting a planet that had stopped listening, but the map on the floor was the most advanced navigation technology we had.

Marcus knelt over it with a carpenter's pencil, tracing routes. I knelt across from him with the notebook. Sienna stood behind me, looking over my shoulder, close enough that I could feel the warmth of her. I ignored this. The lying was functional.

"Here's us." Marcus put a dot on the map — the Arkansas River valley, south of the Boston Mountains, in the stretch of lowland between the river and the first ridgeline. "Here's Fayetteville." Another dot, northwest, on the far side of a dense contour cluster that represented the mountains. "Sixty miles as the crow flies. Except we're not crows. We're eight people, one of whom is seventy-two, one of whom is seven, and one of whom —" He looked at me. "Gets winded on stairs."

"I'm aware."

"Just making sure it's in the model." He turned back to the map. "The obvious route is I-40 west to Alma, then 71 north. Highway the whole way. Flat-ish. Fast."

"And impossible," I said.

"And impossible. Every highway interchange is a congregation point. I-40 funnels through the river valley like a cattle chute — the terrain pinches the road between the river and the bluffs, and every pinch point is a truck stop or a rest area or a gas station, and every one of those is a concentration of Turned. I drove through it three weeks ago and it was already bad. It'll be worse now."

"Back roads?"

"Better. But back roads connect to highways, and the connection points are where it gets bad. Also — vehicles."

"No vehicles," Sienna said. She'd heard Marcus's argument before, in the basement, but she repeated it for the room. "A car engine is the loudest thing in a silent world. Start a truck and every Turned in a half-mile knows where you are."

"Could we push a vehicle?" Dale asked. He was standing by the stairs, empty-handed — he'd left the knife and wood with Caleb. His hands kept flexing.

"Downhill, maybe, for short stretches. But the terrain between here and Fayetteville doesn't do 'short downhill stretches.' It does ravines and ridgelines and creek crossings that would stop a tank." Marcus traced a line on the map, north from our position, into the contour cluster. "The Ozark Highlands Trail."

Sienna went still.

"My dad hiked sections of it," she said. Quiet. The sentence had weight — her father, the man who'd driven to Oklahoma City to get Jaylen and hadn't come back. "He was a section hiker. He'd do weekends, ten or fifteen miles at a time. He took me once. I was twelve."

"What do you remember?"

"Ridgelines. The trail follows the ridgelines mostly — up and down, up and down, but the path stays high. Oak forest. Sandstone bluffs. You can see forever from the top." She paused. "I remember my dad saying the nearest road was sometimes ten miles away. That was the point. He went to get away from roads."

Marcus nodded. "The OHT runs through the Ozark National Forest. I've crossed it hauling timber loads — the forest service roads intersect the trail every ten, fifteen miles. Once you're up in the mountains, there's nothing. No population. No highways. No towns. The Turned congregate where people were. People weren't in the deep woods."

I looked at the map. The contour lines in the Boston Mountains were dense — tight switchbacks of elevation, creek drainages cutting deep V-shapes into the ridgelines. The OHT was marked as a thin dashed line, barely visible, threading along the ridge tops like a crack in a wall.

"It solves three problems," I said. "Population density — zero in the forest. Terrain advantage — the Turned's coordination is optimized for open ground and built environments. Dense forest with ravines disrupts the signal. And navigation — the trail is blazed. White aluminum markers on trees. We don't need a GPS. We need eyes."

"And it creates three problems," Marcus said. He wasn't arguing against it. He was completing the analysis. "Physical difficulty — the OHT gains and loses thousands of feet of elevation. Ruth can barely do a flat mile. Caleb is seven. You —"

"Get winded on stairs. You've mentioned."

"— will struggle. Second: exposure. It's November. The Ozarks in November mean cold nights, frost, possible ice. We have no tents. Limited clothing. A seven-year-old in pajamas." He looked at Caleb's sleeping form on the pew, visible through the stairwell. "Third: isolation. If something goes wrong on a ridgeline twenty miles from the nearest road, there's no help. No pharmacy. No shelter. Just forest."

"The alternative is staying here and watching the clocks run out."

"I know. I'm not arguing. I'm listing the ways we could die so we can plan around them."

---

The planning took three days. In those three days, the Turned count near the church went from twenty-three to twenty-six. The clock was audible.

**Day one: route.** Marcus and I disagreed.

I wanted the shortest path — pick up the trail at the nearest access point, a forest service road eight miles south, and take the most direct line northwest to Fayetteville. Shortest distance, fastest timeline. I had the map. I'd calculated mileage. I was certain.

Marcus looked at my route and said: "That section drops into Hurricane Creek valley. I've hauled loads on the roads above it. The drainage is tight, the hollows are deep, and if there's a herd in that creek bottom, you've got cliff on one side and water on the other and nowhere to climb."

"The map doesn't show any population in that valley."

"The map doesn't show a lot of things. The creek crossings flood in October — I've seen the water marks on the bridges, three feet above the road. The ridgeline above Hare Mountain is exposed for two miles with no tree cover. And every trailhead parking area is exactly the kind of place people would have fled to when the roads failed — a dead-end in the woods where you could hide your car. Those parking areas are going to be occupied."

"You don't know that."

"I know what panicked people do when they're running out of highway. I've been watching them do it for fifteen years. They take the exit. They follow the road to where it ends. They park and they wait. And now they're Turned and they're standing in a trailhead parking lot and your 'shortest path' walks right through them."

We argued. I argued with data — "the map contours suggest the drainage is seasonal, Marcus, the elevation profile clearly shows —" and Marcus argued with experience. He waited until I'd finished mapping a creek bed I'd never seen, then said, "Have you ever been to a creek?"

"I've seen maps of creeks."

He stared at me. The stare lasted long enough that I heard how that sounded.

The argument was the first real authority clash in the group — the kid with the map versus the man who'd driven the roads — and it ended the way it had to end: I conceded. Not because Marcus pulled rank. Because he was right, and being right was more important than being in charge. Though I want the record to show that the elevation profile *did* clearly show what I said it showed. The elevation profile just turned out to be irrelevant. This is a distinction I cared about at the time and that nobody else cared about at all.

Marcus's route was longer — an extra day, maybe two, approaching from the south on higher ground, avoiding the creek bottoms, staying on ridgelines with sightlines. Less efficient. More survivable.

"A map is a picture of a place," Marcus said. "It is not the place."

I wrote this in the notebook and underlined it.

**Day two: supplies.** Marcus proposed the truck.

"Atwoods is south of town," he said, tracing the route on the map we'd taped to the sanctuary wall. "Three miles down the highway. We drive there, we pull every Turned between here and the store toward the south end of town. By the time we leave tomorrow morning, the north side — our exit route — should be cleaner."

It was the first time anyone had proposed using the engine noise as a weapon instead of a liability. The truck drew Turned — we'd known this since Day 1. But drawing them *away*, pulling them south toward the highway while the church sat north, that was Marcus thinking like a driver. You don't just haul a load. You read the road ahead.

"We need everyone who can carry," Maria said, already working the logistics. "We can't haul everything in one truck run if we're parking at a distance. Everyone goes except Ruth, Jim, and Caleb."

Six of us went. Marcus drove. Maria rode shotgun with her list. Sienna, Dale, and I sat in the truck bed with the tailgate down. As the truck pulled onto Highway 21, I watched the Turned in the church parking lot — the half-dozen that had been orbiting our sanctuary for three weeks — pivot toward the sound. Head-turns. The slow gravitational drift. Then, as the truck moved south, they followed. Not fast. But south, toward the highway, away from the church. That was the point.

Marcus parked a quarter mile from Atwoods — close enough to walk, far enough that the sound would draw Turned to the truck rather than the store. He left the engine running. He put a CD in — one of Ruth's husband Gerald's old Merle Haggard albums that had been sitting in the glove box since before the world ended — and turned the volume up. Merle Haggard singing "Mama Tried" to an empty highway, the speakers buzzing, the engine idling underneath. A beacon of noise. Everything within a quarter mile would drift toward it.

"Move," Marcus said.

Atwoods was a farm and ranch supply — the kind of place that sold feed corn and fence posts and hunting rifles and had a camping section in the back that smelled like canvas and rubber. Marcus had been there a hundred times hauling shelving. He knew the layout.

"Walmart's picked clean," he'd said the night before. "Two weeks of panic buying and then the Turned moved in. Atwoods is different. People raided the food and the guns. Nobody thought to grab sleeping bags."

He was right. The front windows were broken but the store was largely intact. The gun cases were empty, glass shattered, every rifle and shotgun gone in the first week. The ammunition shelves were bare. But the camping aisle was almost untouched. In the logic of panic, people had grabbed weapons and food and left behind the things that would actually keep them alive in the woods.

We moved fast. Maria had her list, written on the back of a church bulletin. Backpacks — real hiking packs with internal frames and hip belts, not the canvas military surplus we'd been planning on. Eight of them, sized as close as we could manage. Sleeping bags rated to twenty degrees. Tarps — lightweight, waterproof, the kind hunters used for ground blinds. Sleeping pads, the thin foam rolls that wouldn't do much but would keep you off the cold ground. A water filter and purification tablets. Two camp stoves and fuel canisters. A cooking pot and a skillet. Headlamps with extra batteries. Fire starters. First aid kits. Paracord. Duct tape.

Marcus lingered in the hunting section. The gun cases were empty but the archery wall still had stock — compound bows too complex for panicked looters to figure out, and three crossbows in their boxes. He took a crossbow, a case of bolts, and a sharpening kit. "Quieter than a gun," he said. "And bolts are reusable." He also grabbed hatchets — small ones, the kind you'd use to split kindling — and a hunting knife for everyone. Eight blades. We weren't going into the mountains unarmed.

In the camping food aisle, we loaded freeze-dried meals. Mountain House, Backpacker's Pantry — the kind of food that weighed nothing and lasted forever and tasted like salted cardboard and would keep you walking. We took everything on the shelf. We also took energy bars, trail mix, instant oatmeal, powdered drink mixes. Calories that were light enough to carry and dense enough to matter.

We loaded up — six people carrying what we'd normally throw in a truck bed. Packs on our backs, sleeping bags under arms, the freeze-dried meals distributed between us in plastic bags. The crossbow across Marcus's shoulders. The hatchets clinking in Dale's pack. Three miles back to the church, on foot, loaded like mules.

We could hear the truck before we saw it. Merle Haggard was still playing — "Silver Wings," now — but the sound was different, muffled, coming through bodies. The Turned had found it. A dozen of them, maybe fifteen, clustered around the truck in the slow gravitational drift, drawn to the engine and the music, standing in the road with their heads tilted toward the speakers. Some were touching the truck — hands on the hood, on the fenders, the patient, purposeless contact of organisms drawn to vibration. The truck had done its job. It had pulled them south, away from the church, and now they stood around it like congregants at a service none of them understood.

Marcus looked at the cluster. "Leave it," he said. "We go around."

We gave the truck a wide berth — two hundred yards east, cutting through a strip mall parking lot, moving fast and quiet with our loads. The Turned at the truck didn't notice us. They were focused on the music, on the engine, on whatever residual pattern the sound activated in whatever was left of their brains. Merle Haggard singing about silver wings to an audience that would never leave.

The route east took us past the hospital. I hadn't been thinking about it — hadn't let myself think about it, the way you don't let yourself look at the sun. But the hospital was only six blocks east of the highway, and as we cut through the parking lot of a shuttered insurance office, the hospital's lot was visible across the road, and the cluster of Turned in the lot was visible from there, and among them — in blue scrubs, in the ponytail she wore for night shifts, standing in the November sun with bare feet and nothing behind her eyes — was my mother.

I stopped walking.

Marcus saw what I was looking at. He put his hand on my shoulder — firm, the grip of a man who understood that the next ten seconds mattered. "I see her," he said, quietly. "Keep moving."

"That's my mom."

"I know. Keep moving, Nate."

The group kept walking. I kept walking. My legs moved because Marcus's hand was on my shoulder and the group was moving and stopping would mean looking and looking would mean — I kept walking. But I saw her. She was standing near the ambulance bay with maybe fifteen other Turned — former staff, still gravitating to the place where they'd worked. Her hands were at her sides. Her face was tilted toward the sun. The smile. The vacant, patient, terrible smile.

I'd known since Day 1. Night shift, first night, a hospital filling with panicking patients and panicking staff. She never had a chance. I'd carried this the way you carry a sealed envelope — knowing what's inside, not opening it, because at least the envelope is containable.

The envelope was open now. The contents were a woman in blue scrubs who had said "Happy Friday, bud" three hundred times and who brought home Whataburger after every shift and who kept two nursing textbooks on a shelf like trophies and who had taught me by accident everything I needed to survive. She was standing in a parking lot with bare feet and the organism had taken everything that made her my mother and replaced it with the smile.

We walked. The hospital fell behind us. My hands were shaking on the pack straps — not the adrenaline shake, not the threshold shake, the grief shake, the one that comes from holding something sealed for twenty-three days and watching it crack open on a sidewalk at walking pace with fifty pounds of camping gear on your back.

Nobody else had seen her. Marcus had. He walked beside me and said nothing, which was the right thing.

The shaking stopped. Something harder replaced the grief. Something dense, with edges. The grief was an open wound. This was the wound closing around a piece of metal.

I was angry.

Cold. Structural. The anger of a machine recalibrating. The organism had taken my mother. The organism operated through fear — human fear, human biology, the panic response that turned hospitals into conversion factories and neighborhoods into herds. The organism hadn't chosen my mother specifically. It had built a system where a night-shift nurse in a hospital full of terrified patients had zero chance of survival. The system had worked exactly as designed, and my mother was standing in a parking lot with bare feet because she had been inside it when it activated.

I wanted to burn the parking lot. I wanted to burn the hospital. I wanted to walk back there and — what? What would I do? Hit them? They were Turned. They didn't feel it. Scream at them? They'd smile. The anger had no target it could reach and no action it could take and it sat in my chest like a hot coal with nowhere to go.

And underneath — something less rational, something I recognized as unfair even as I felt it. Anger at the Turned themselves. At the fifteen people standing in that parking lot who had been nurses and orderlies and patients and who had *let the fear take them.* I knew — I knew with the analytical part of my brain, the part that had read the textbook — that they hadn't chosen it. That the conversion mechanism was biological, involuntary, a cascade of neurochemical responses that no amount of willpower could override once the threshold was crossed. I knew this. The anger didn't care. The anger said: they panicked. They let the fear win. Their fear fed the cascade that took her. Their weakness killed my mother.

It was not rational. It was not fair. I did not care.

And deeper — anger at myself. I'd known since Day 1. I'd done the math. Night shift, first night, a hospital. I'd known and I'd sealed it in an envelope and I'd sat in a church basement writing in a notebook while she stood in a parking lot with bare feet. I was too slow. Too comfortable. Too willing to sit at a window and calculate instead of act. If I'd been faster — if I'd been someone other than a fat fifteen-year-old who got winded on stairs — would it have mattered? Probably not. The math said no. But the anger said *you didn't even try.*

We walked the three miles back to the church. I carried two packs — mine and one of the extras — and the sleeping bags and the hatchets and the weight of what I'd seen. None of it was as heavy as it should have been. The anger was doing something unexpected — it was making the weight lighter. Every step, the anger lifted with me. Not grief. Grief makes you heavy. Anger makes you fast. I noticed this, the way the anger functioned as fuel, and the noticing disturbed me, and I took the next step anyway.

I didn't tell anyone what I'd seen or felt. Grief I could have shared — grief has a script, people know what to say. But this anger had no script. I carried it the way I carried everything: sealed, sorted, filed.

---

Maria took command of the packing.

In twenty-two days she'd turned the church's pantry from a disorganized food bank closet into a precision logistics operation. Now she applied the same ruthless accounting to the Atwoods haul. She laid everything out on the sanctuary floor — eight packs, eight sleeping bags, the tarps, the pads, the stoves, the food, the blades — and counted and weighed and organized. Every ounce miscalculated had a human cost.

Calories per person per day: 1,800 minimum, 2,400 for the walking pace we'd need. Weight per person: fifteen pounds maximum for Jim and Ruth, twenty for Marcus and Sienna, ten for Caleb, who would carry nothing because he was seven and would need to be carried himself when the trail got steep.

I would carry twenty-five. Maria decided this without consulting me.

"You're the heaviest and the youngest besides Caleb. You carry the most."

"I'm the one with the worst cardio."

"Then improve your cardio. You have two days." She handed me a pack — one of the Atwoods hiking packs, green, with a frame that dug into my lower back before I'd even loaded it. "Start walking laps around the church yard. Now."

I walked laps. Sienna walked with me. We walked in loops around the church, the gravel crunching under our shoes — the truck had drawn most of the Turned south, but a few had drifted back, two or three in the parking lot tracking us with their slow head-turns — and we walked and walked and Sienna set the pace and I matched it and my lungs burned and my legs ached and she didn't slow down and I didn't ask her to because asking would have meant admitting I couldn't keep up and admitting I couldn't keep up would have meant — well. I didn't want to admit it. Not to her.

Sienna thought I was sulking. I could feel it in the way she kept glancing at me — the sidelong assessment, the small frown, the expression of a girl who'd seen me retreat into my own head before and was calibrating whether to push or wait. She'd seen the version of me that withdrew. The quiet, passive version that sat at a window and watched. She was looking at me and seeing that version, the one she'd spent three weeks learning to identify.

She was wrong. I wasn't withdrawing. I was burning. The anger from the hospital parking lot was still in my chest, hot and dense, and the walking wasn't making it smaller — the walking was feeding it, because the walking hurt, and the pain felt earned. My lungs burning and my legs aching and the Turned in the parking lot tracking us with their slow head-turns — the smiles, always the smiles — and every smile was the smile in the hospital parking lot, the one on my mother's face, and the anger flared at each one like a match touched to gasoline.

On the sixth lap, the impulse to stop hit me like a wall. Not pain — laziness. The specific, philosophical laziness that says *this is enough, you've proven the point, sit down.* The belief that the world owed me the right to quit when I was tired. I recognized it the way you recognize your own handwriting — familiar, personal, mine. I'd been carrying this particular lie my whole life, the one that said effort had a reasonable limit and I'd reached it and anything beyond was someone else's job. In the old world, that lie had cost me grades and friendships and the respect of people who'd tried to push me. In this world, it would cost me my legs on day three of the trail and everyone else's survival along with them.

I didn't stop. Not because I overcame the laziness — not because Sienna was watching — because the anger wouldn't let me. The anger said: *you don't get to stop. You sat at a window. You sat in a church basement. You sat while she stood in a parking lot with bare feet. You don't get to sit anymore.* The pain in my legs was something I owed. The burning in my lungs was a debt. Mercy for myself was the same weakness that had kept me at the window on Day 1, and mercy for myself was over.

"You're doing fine," she said, on the fourth lap.

"I'm dying."

"You're not dying. I've seen dying. You're just out of shape."

"Is this your version of encouragement?"

"My version of encouragement involves a stopwatch and a coach screaming at you from the infield. This is gentle."

We walked another lap. The Turned tracked us. The gravel crunched. My breathing was loud enough to qualify as a broadcast.

"Nate."

"Yeah."

"The Lyles are dead."

I didn't say anything.

"Three people are dead. You saw it coming. You told Craig. He didn't listen. And right now, in your head, you're building the version where that's not your fault. Because you warned him. Because he had a gun and you had a notebook. Because you're fifteen and you're fat and what were you supposed to do — you did everything you could. Right?"

"I did do what I could."

"No. You did everything you were *comfortable* doing. You walked over there once, said your piece, and walked back. When he didn't listen, you filed it under 'not my problem' because you'd already decided you weren't the kind of person who could make someone listen. You decided that before you walked over there. You decided it before you decided to go. You decided it on Day One, when you sat at your window and watched Lisa Anderson get taken and said 'I'm fifteen and I weigh a hundred and eighty pounds' like those numbers were a verdict instead of a starting point."

I stopped walking. She stopped with me.  She didn't know I had already given myself this talk.

"I couldn't save Lisa Anderson." It came out of me automatically, an old habit. I hated it.

"Maybe not. But you could have done something you hadn't already decided was impossible. You could have banged on the window. You could have thrown something. You could have screamed — not to save her, maybe, but to try, so that the trying was on the record, so that the next time you looked in the mirror you'd see a person who tried and failed instead of a person who calculated that trying wasn't worth it." She was breathing hard too — not from the walking, from the saying. "You keep using your body as an excuse. 'I can't run. I'm out of shape. I get winded on stairs.' But you also figured out the fear mechanism. You also read the textbook. You also walked to the Lyles' house and back through nine Turned. Your body does things, Nate. You just won't take credit for them because taking credit means taking responsibility, and taking responsibility means the next failure is *yours*."

"It was mine. The Lyles —"

"Yes. It was yours. And mine. And Jim's. And everyone's who saw what was coming and accepted Craig's 'no' like it was the end of the conversation." She looked at me and her eyes were fierce and wet at the same time. "In the best case scenario, Nate — the absolute best case — everything that goes wrong is your fault. Because if it's your fault, that means you had the power to prevent it, which means you have the power to do better next time. If nothing is your fault — if you're just a fat fifteen-year-old kid who can't run and can't help and can't change anything — then you're powerless. And you're not powerless. You're the person who figured out what's happening when the entire rest of the world couldn't. So stop building the case for why you can't do things and start building plans for how to do them better."

The Turned in the parking lot swayed. A bird — an actual bird, a real one, alive — crossed the parking lot and landed on the church sign. We stood in the gravel and my lungs burned and my legs ached and the thing Sienna had just said was sitting in my chest like a stone, heavy and cold and true.

But true in a way she didn't intend. She meant: *be brave. Try harder. Take responsibility.* She was talking to the passive boy who watched from windows and decided the odds weren't worth it. She was right about that boy. But the boy standing next to her was holding an anger she couldn't see, and her words were landing in it like stones in a furnace.

*Stop building the case for why you can't do things.* Yes. Stop being weak. Stop flinching. The Turned want to eat you, and what was human in them is gone, and mercy is the comfortable lie, and the comfortable lie will get you killed.

*You sat at your window and watched Lisa Anderson get taken.* Yes. I sat. I calculated. I was too slow, too soft, too willing to be comfortable while the world burned. I deserved the pain in my legs and the burning in my lungs and the chafing and the exhaustion because the pain was what I'd earned by being the version of myself that sat and watched.

She didn't know what she was feeding. She thought she was lighting a fire under a passive kid. She was pouring accelerant on a blaze she couldn't see.

"The old world could afford what you're doing," she said, quieter now. "The comfortable lies. The *I'm not that kind of person* excuse. The old world had margins — room for people to hide inside their own limitations and still survive. This world consumes people who don't adapt. You know this. You wrote it in the notebook. You just haven't applied it to yourself."

*This world consumes people who don't adapt.* The Turned in the parking lot, smiling. The fifteen people in the hospital parking lot, smiling. My mother. They hadn't adapted. They'd panicked — let the fear take them — and the world had consumed them. Sienna meant something humane by "adapt." She meant: grow, push yourself, become who you need to be. But the anger heard something else. The anger heard: *what was human is gone. The ones who couldn't adapt are gone. Mercy is what the old world could afford. This world can't.*

I started walking again. She walked with me. The next lap was faster. The pace was punishment and the punishment was fuel and the fuel made me faster and the faster I walked the more my legs burned and the more my legs burned the less I thought about the parking lot and the less I thought about the parking lot the angrier I got that the only way to stop thinking about it was pain.

I laughed. It was the second laugh since before the Turned. Genuine — because the absurdity of everything, the walking in circles, the gravel, the girl next to me who thought she was curing my passivity when she was sharpening something she wouldn't recognize until later. She looked at me when I laughed and something in her expression shifted — surprise, pleasure, the brief illumination of a person who had forgotten that sounds like that existed. Then she looked forward and set a slightly faster pace and I matched it and my lungs burned worse and I was alive and angry and the two things felt like the same thing.

**Day three: preparation.** Jim held a final service.

In the basement, by candlelight, the eight of us plus Caleb's zoo of wooden animals lined up on the folding table. Jim read from Isaiah. Ruth sang something I didn't recognize — older, simpler, a melody that felt like it had been composed by people in a situation like ours. Dale sat with his hands on his knees, still, the first time I'd seen him fully still without tension. Maria was beside him, her shoulder touching his. They'd been fighting about rationing two hours ago. Now they were touching. The distances people traverse in the space of an evening.

During the reading, I saw Marcus lean toward Sienna. He was speaking low — below the candlelight, below Jim's voice, the murmur of a man delivering information he didn't want overheard. Sienna's face changed. Not dramatically — a tightening around the eyes, a stillness in the jaw, the controlled rearrangement of someone receiving news they have to absorb without reacting. Marcus glanced at me as he spoke. The glance was brief and it contained pity and I hated it — hated the pity, hated that Marcus had decided this was information Sienna needed, hated that he was right, hated that the information was *my mother is standing in a parking lot six blocks from here and the organism took her* and that someone other than me was saying it because I couldn't.

Sienna didn't look at me. Not during the reading, not during Ruth's song, not during the prayer. She was careful about it — the deliberate not-looking of a person who understood that the wrong kind of attention at the wrong moment would crack something that was barely holding. She knew she couldn't help. The knowing was in her posture — the way she sat slightly forward, slightly toward me, without turning, without reaching, the body language of someone standing at the edge of a wound they can see but can't touch.

Jim prayed. The prayer was short: "Lord, we're leaving tomorrow. We don't know if we'll make it. But we're going because staying is the slower way to die and You didn't make us for sitting still. Walk with us. Or if You won't walk with us, at least walk ahead of us and flatten the trail for Ruth. Amen."

Ruth said, "The trail doesn't need flattening. I need better knees."

Jim said, "I'll pray for those too."

During the packing, Marcus brought up the chickens. Not the leaving-them-behind part. The other part.

"Three hens," he said, not looking at anyone in particular. "Protein. We're hiking sixty miles on freeze-dried nothing. Three birds is three meals. Real meals."

Nobody said anything. The silence had a specific shape — the shape of eight people not looking at the corner of the sanctuary where Caleb was feeding scraps to Triceratops through the slats of a cardboard box he'd converted into a travel crate. Marcus followed the silence to its source. He looked at Caleb. He looked at the chicken. He looked back at the group.

"Never mind," he said.

Nobody mentioned it again.

Later, Caleb tugged on Marcus's sleeve. "What about Triceratops and Steggy and Rex?"

Marcus looked at me. I looked at the floor. The chickens couldn't come — we were biking to the trailhead, then hiking sixty miles of mountain trail with packs that already weighed more than Caleb did. There was no version of the plan that included three hens.

"They'll be okay here," Marcus said. "Plenty of bugs in that yard. They got along fine before us."

Caleb was quiet. Not the loud, protesting quiet of a child who might argue — the still quiet of a child who had learned in the past two weeks that "we can't" was the answer to most questions now, and that the things you loved were the things you left behind, and that arguing didn't change this.

He went to the coop that evening and sat with them for an hour. I don't know what he said to them. I didn't ask.

During the planning days Jim mentioned a dream. Casual, over coffee, the way he mentioned everything — as if the thing he was saying was less important than the act of saying it and the act of saying it was less important than the coffee.

"I dreamed about a woman in a lab coat," he said. "She was standing at a desk covered in papers — printouts, graphs, numbers I couldn't read. She showed me one of the printouts and said, 'The numbers are wrong but the math is close.' Then she took the printout back and corrected something and showed it to me again and said, 'Closer.'" He sipped his coffee. "She had kind eyes. Tired. The eyes of someone who's been working too long on something that matters too much."

I looked at him. "You've never met Dr. Moss."

"I've never met anyone in a lab coat, son. The closest I've come to a laboratory is the church kitchen, and Ruth's the only one running experiments in there." He smiled. "Probably just my brain filling in details. I've been listening to her broadcasts. The subconscious builds a picture."

He was probably right. The brain does that — takes scattered data and assembles it into narratives during sleep. It didn't mean anything. Except that Jim had described a woman at a desk correcting printouts, and when we reached the university five weeks later, Dr. Moss's desk was covered in exactly the printouts he'd described, and she did have kind eyes, and she did say something about the math being close, and Jim looked at me when she said it and said nothing, and I said nothing, and neither of us needed to.

Marcus and Dale made a second run — the bike shop on Main Street. They came back with eight bicycles, two of them electric with charges that Marcus estimated at fifteen to twenty miles. Ruth and Jim got the e-bikes. The plan was simple: ride twenty miles to the OHT trailhead on Forest Service Road 1003, leave the bikes, start walking. Twenty miles of road we wouldn't have to hike. Twenty miles of pavement before the real suffering began.

Marcus packed the CB radio. He'd been listening every evening, catching fragments of Moss's broadcasts, confirming she was still there, still transmitting, still offering what she had. The last fragment, caught the night before: "— the frequency emitter has a range of approximately eighty meters. Within that radius, the Turned's collective coordination is disrupted. They become individuals again. Disoriented. Passive. The emitter buys time. It is not a solution. But time is what —" Static.

Eighty meters. A circle of safety in a world that had none. It was waiting for us on the other side of the mountains, and all we had to do was walk sixty miles of trail and another thirty-five of highway through the most rugged terrain in the state at the pace of a seventy-two-year-old woman without anyone's heart rate crossing a line that none of us could see.

The last night at the church, Jim held a service. Not the brief candle-and-psalm services he'd been doing on Wednesdays — a real one. Hymns. A reading from Ecclesiastes. A silence at the end that lasted so long I thought he'd forgotten what came next, and then I realized the silence *was* what came next, and that the silence was the sermon.

Afterward, nobody went to bed. We sat in the basement and talked about things that had nothing to do with tomorrow. Ruth described her first year of teaching — the room she was given, the chalk that was always the wrong color, the principal who called her "dear" until she told him to stop. Marcus talked about Ava's birthday party and the purple frosting and how she'd insisted on a theme of "dogs in space" and he'd built her a cardboard rocket ship with a stuffed beagle inside. Maria said the filing system at the law firm was the only beautiful thing she'd ever created, and the way she said "beautiful" — serious, without irony — made everyone go quiet for a moment because she meant it.

Dale gave Sienna the cardinal he'd carved. She turned it in her hands, feeling the feathers he'd cut into the wood, and said, "My mom has a cardinal that comes to our feeder every morning," and Dale said, "I know. You told me," and I didn't know when she'd told him that, which meant there were conversations happening in this basement that I wasn't part of, which meant the group had grown its own connective tissue without me organizing it, and that was the best thing I'd learned in three weeks.

Sienna and I ended up on the stairs, which was our spot when we needed to talk without an audience. She had her knees pulled up, her chin resting on them. I sat one step below because the stairs were narrow and proximity required negotiation.

She knew. I could feel it — the silence between us had changed. Before, her silences were tactical, the pauses of a girl choosing her next challenge. This one was careful. She was sitting next to a thing she'd been told not to touch.

She didn't mention my mother. She didn't ask if I was okay. She said:

"I'm scared." Not a confession. A measurement. The way she'd report a heart rate.

"Me too."

"Good. Honest people live longer." She bumped her knee against my shoulder. "We're going to make it."

"You don't know that."

"No. But I'm saying it anyway. And you're going to remember I said it on day three of the trail when your legs are gone and you want to quit. Deal?"

"Deal."

She went to the basement. I sat on the stairs for a while longer, listening to the sounds of people settling — blankets rustling, whispered goodnights, the small coughs and sighs that mean a room full of humans is transitioning from awake to asleep. These were the sounds of my congregation, and I use that word deliberately because Jim would understand it and because it's the right one.

I sat in the steeple one last time. The parking lot, the road, the trailer park across Highway 21. My trailer was still there — Lot 7, the one with the dented mailbox and the propane tank I'd knocked with my hip on the night of my first mistake. Somewhere inside it, on a shelf above the washer-dryer, *Brunner & Suddarth's Medical-Surgical Nursing* sat where I'd left it, open to the chapter on the autonomic nervous system, the passage about cognitive dissonance circled in pencil.

I wouldn't go back for it. The textbook had taught me what it could. Everything after this would be learned on the trail.

Tomorrow we walked.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #12:**

*Day 24. Marcus's route, not mine. His is longer and safer and he's right. "A map is a picture of a place. It is not the place." I'm going to tattoo this on my brain.*

*My pack weighs thirty-two pounds. Maria said twenty-five. The extra seven are food I added because I know what hungry feels like and I'd rather carry it than feel it.*

*I saw my mother today. She was standing in the hospital parking lot in her blue scrubs. She was smiling. The organism's smile, not hers. I am not going to write about this yet. I am going to carry it the way I carry everything — in the part of my brain that processes data without feeling it. The data is: she is gone. The feeling is: I can't.*

*There is something else. Not grief. Something with edges. I expected sadness and I got that, but underneath the sadness is something harder, something that does not sit still the way grief sits still. I am not going to write about that either. Not yet. It is useful in a way that frightens me.*

*I am terrified. My resting heart rate is 68. The gap between those two facts is the only thing keeping me alive.*


# Chapter 19: The First Mile

The Ozark Highlands Trail does not believe in flat.

We rode bicycles to the trailhead. Eight people on eight bikes, pedaling twenty miles of two-lane blacktop through the Ozark foothills, packs strapped to rear racks and handlebars and, in my case, balanced on my lap like a pregnant belly made of nylon and poor decisions. Ruth and Jim had the e-bikes — Ruth because her knees couldn't pedal twenty miles, Jim because he was seventy-three and nobody argued with Ruth about getting one so nobody could argue with Jim either. Caleb rode on Marcus's handlebars, gripping the crossbar with both hands, the wooden beagle in his jacket pocket bumping against the frame.

The road was empty. Three weeks of no traffic and the pavement was already changing — leaves in the gutters, a branch down in the right lane, the first cracks where tree roots were starting to reclaim what asphalt had borrowed. We passed houses. Some had Turned in the yards — the head-turns tracked us as we pedaled past, the smiles following, but bikes were fast enough that none of them transitioned beyond passive interest. We passed Clarksville's city limit sign and the Dollar General and the shuttered Sonic Drive-In and the world we were leaving behind.

We reached the trailhead at midday — a gravel parking area off Forest Service Road 1003. The parking area was empty. No cars, no Turned. The first good sign in three weeks.

We leaned the bikes against a split-rail fence at the edge of the lot. Eight bicycles, two of them still showing a charge on their battery indicators. Machines we'd never use again. Marcus looked at them for a moment — the particular look of a man who'd spent his life around vehicles, who understood the value of anything with wheels — and then turned away. We were leaving the world of wheels. Everything after this was feet.

The trailhead marker was a brown post with a white blaze — an aluminum diamond nailed to the wood, catching the November light. Beyond it, the trail entered the forest like a thread being pulled into fabric: a two-foot-wide path of packed earth and leaf litter, climbing immediately, switchbacking up a hardwood hollow toward a sandstone ridge that was invisible from below.

"That's up," Caleb said. He was holding Dale's hand. Dale had given him the beagle to carry in his jacket pocket and Caleb had his other hand on the beagle and he was looking at the trail the way a seven-year-old looks at something that is clearly, obviously, unfairly tall.

"That's up," Marcus confirmed.

"All of it?"

"Most of it."

Caleb looked at me. I don't know why he looked at me — maybe because I was the biggest person who also clearly didn't want to walk uphill, and solidarity with the reluctant is comforting at any age.

"I don't want to," he said.

"Me neither, buddy. Let's go."

---

The first mile climbed six hundred feet. I know this because I asked Marcus. I'm the kind of person who wants to quantify suffering, as if knowing the exact gradient will make my lungs burn less. It does not.

Oak leaves covered the trail — ankle-deep, dry, hiding every root and rock beneath them. The path switchbacked up the hollow in tight turns, gaining elevation through a forest of white oaks and hickories that were shedding their canopy in sheets of bronze and amber. The leaves crunched under eight pairs of feet. Below us, through the thinning trees, the lowland we'd left fell away into haze.

The order of march: Marcus in front, because he'd crossed these ridgelines by road and had the best instinct for terrain. Then Sienna, setting pace, her stride shortened to match Ruth's but still fluid, still the athlete's economy — and she kept bouncing on her toes when the group stopped, stretching her calves against rocks, the runner's body idling at a speed it found insulting. Then Jim and Ruth, side by side, Jim's hand occasionally steadying Ruth's elbow on the steeper grades. Then Dale and Caleb, Dale's knife out and a piece of wood in his other hand, carving as he walked, the shavings falling behind him like breadcrumbs. Then Maria, who walked with the precise, metronomic pace of a woman who had decided that sixty miles was a logistical problem and was solving it one step at a time.

Then me.

I was last because I was slowest. Physics. A hundred and eighty pounds going uphill on legs that had never climbed anything steeper than the stairs to the school library, with thirty-two pounds of pack shifting on my back like a drunk passenger. The hip belt dug into the tops of my hip bones — a grinding pressure that started as discomfort and became pain within the first half mile. The shoulder straps pulled backward, hauling at my collarbones, making me lean forward on the uphills until my center of gravity was somewhere in front of my knees and every step felt like catching a fall. My back was soaked. The pack trapped heat against my spine and the sweat had nowhere to go and by the second switchback my shirt was plastered to my skin and the shirt was rubbing against the pack frame in a way that would, by nightfall, produce a raw stripe across both shoulder blades that would hurt for five days.

By the first switchback I was breathing hard. By the second I was sweating through my shirt despite the cold. By the third I was making sounds that were technically breathing but sounded more like a large animal being slowly inflated. And somewhere around the third switchback my inner thighs began to chafe — the fabric of my jeans, damp with sweat, grinding against skin with every step, a specific humiliation I was not going to mention to anyone, least of all Sienna, who was walking thirty yards ahead with the easy stride of a person whose body was designed for this.

I threw up on the fourth switchback. Just leaned over, hands on knees — the pack nearly tipping me forward onto my face — and threw up my breakfast onto the leaves beside the trail. Sienna glanced back. She didn't stop. She didn't comment. She looked, assessed that I wasn't dying, and kept walking.

This was the nicest thing she'd ever done for me.

I kept walking. The anger wouldn't let me stop. The anger I'd brought from Clarksville — the hospital parking lot, the laps around the church — was the only engine I had that didn't require oxygen. My lungs burned. My legs screamed. The anger said: *good. You earned this. You sat at a window while Lisa Anderson was taken. You sat in a basement while your mother stood in a parking lot with bare feet. The pain is what you owe.* And the pain became something I leaned into rather than something I endured, and the leaning-in looked like grit but it wasn't grit, it was punishment, and the punishment kept me moving when grit would have let me sit down.

Somewhere on the fifth switchback, Sienna dropped back. She'd been thirty yards ahead, setting pace, but now she was beside me, matching my labored stride.

"Hey," she said. "You okay?"

"Fine." I was not fine. I was covered in sweat and vomit residue and the inside of my thighs felt like they'd been rubbed with sandpaper and I was furious at everything that existed.

"You've got that look."

"What look."

"The one where you're three zip codes deep in your own head and you forgot to leave a forwarding address." She bumped her shoulder against my arm — a light contact, almost playful. Different from the fierce girl who'd walked laps with me at the church. Softer. "Talk to me."

"Nothing to talk about."

She studied me for a moment — the assessing look, the one I recognized from her reprimand speech, except this time it was gentler, searching rather than challenging. She didn't find what she was looking for.

"Okay," she said. She dropped back to her pace position. The trail went up. I followed.

Ruth was slow. Her knees ground audibly on the steep sections, a sound like sand in a joint. Jim stayed with her, matching her pace exactly, his hand appearing at her elbow on the switchbacks and disappearing on the straights, the automatic choreography of a man who had spent a career walking beside people who needed him.

Caleb fell twice. The first time he tripped on a root hidden under leaves and went down hard, skinning both palms. He cried — briefly, sharply, the cry of a child who is hurt but not broken — and Dale picked him up and brushed the leaves off and said "What do we do when we fall?" and Caleb, still sniffling, said "Get up" and Dale said "That's right" and they kept walking. The second time was on a rock scramble near the ridgeline where the trail crossed exposed sandstone. Caleb's shoe slipped and he slid three feet before Marcus caught him — one hand, casual, the reflexes of a man who'd been catching things that slid for twenty years.

Dale's hands were shaking. Not the cold — the Suboxone. He'd taken his last dose that morning. The withdrawal wouldn't hit fully for another twelve to twenty-four hours, but the edge of it was there — a tremor in the fingers, a tightness in the jaw. He carved as he walked, and the carving was a little rougher than usual, the strokes a little less controlled, and I watched him the way I watched everything: from behind, measuring, cataloguing, unable to help.

---

On the last rock scramble before the ridge, Marcus stopped and cut a length of river cane from a thicket beside the trail — five feet long, thumb-thick, the kind of cane that grew along every creek bottom in the Ozarks. He stripped the leaves and handed it to Ruth.

"Walking stick," he said. "Use it."

Within an hour everyone had one. Marcus cut them from cane and small hardwood saplings, sizing each to the user. The difference was immediate — a third point of contact on the rocky sections, something to brace against on the steep descents, a way to test footing before committing weight. I hadn't known I needed one until I had it. Then I couldn't imagine walking without it.

We made the ridgeline by late afternoon. Seven hours for three miles. In the old world, an hour's walk. In this world, an odyssey.

The ridgeline opened up. The trail ran along the spine of the ridge, sandstone outcrops on both sides, the forest canopy thinning to let the sky through. And the sky was — I don't have the word. I'd been looking at sky through steeple louvers and kitchen windows for three weeks. This was sky without a frame. Huge and blue and cold, the late-autumn clarity that comes to the Ozarks in November when the humidity dies and the air turns to glass.

To the east, the river valley spread out below us — thirty miles of lowland, the river a silver thread, the towns invisible at this distance but present as smudges of grey where the roads converged. Down there, the world was ending. From up here, you couldn't tell. The valley looked the way it had looked for ten thousand years: patient, indifferent, the land not caring what happened on its surface.

To the west, more ridgelines. Rolling, forested, extending to the horizon in diminishing blue layers like a painting of itself. The OHT ran along those ridgelines — we could see the next rise, and the one after that, and the one after that, each one a day's walk, each one a promise and a threat.

The forest was quiet.

Not the held-breath silence of a world monitoring itself for danger. This was living quiet. Wind in the remaining canopy leaves, a dry rattle that sounded like paper. A creek somewhere below, audible only as a texture in the air. The skitter of a squirrel or chipmunk in the underbrush — a real animal, doing real animal things, unbothered by the end of human civilization.

No Turned.

The population density up here was zero before the outbreak. The terrain — steep, rocky, pathless off-trail — was hostile to the collective behavior. Dense forest with ravines and bluffs broke the signal, scattered the herd, turned the Turned into confused individuals who wandered rather than hunted. Marcus had been right. The mountains were empty.

"Camp here," Marcus said. He'd found a bluff overlook — a sandstone shelf jutting out from the ridge, fifteen feet wide, protected on three sides by rock and forest. The view ran east into the valley. The bluff face dropped fifty feet — nothing was climbing up. The trail continued along the ridge behind us, the only approach a narrow path through thick undergrowth.

We made camp. Marcus and Sienna strung tarps between trees at the edge of the bluff — the lightweight ones from Atwoods, rigged with paracord, angled to shed rain and block wind. We rolled out sleeping pads on the rock — thin foam, not much padding, but insulation between body and stone. The pads were narrow. The rock was uneven. They were better than bare sandstone, but not by much.

Ruth sat on the folding camp chair Maria had insisted on carrying — three pounds of aluminum that Maria had defended against every objection about weight with the flat declaration "Ruth sits or Ruth doesn't walk tomorrow." Dale carved. The wood he was working was cedar — aromatic, reddish, he'd picked it up at the trailhead — and the smell of cedar shavings mixed with the cold stone and leaf rot of the ridge and made something that smelled like a world that was still possible.

We ate freeze-dried beef stew reconstituted with creek water heated on the camp stove. The portions were small. The portions were always going to be small. I could have eaten three of them and still wanted more. Everyone ate carefully, slowly, making the meal last, because making it last was the only way to pretend it was enough.

After dinner, the conversation nobody wanted to have: gear.

"We packed too much," Marcus said. He was looking at the pile of equipment we'd hauled up six hundred vertical feet. The extra water containers — unnecessary, since every hollow had a creek. The camp shovel. The hatchet handles that duplicated the ones on our belts. The second cooking pot. The heavy canned goods Maria had added as backup. Dale's second tarp. The extra paracord. "Every ounce we carry tomorrow, we carry up another ridge. And the ridge after that. For sixty miles."

The math was brutal: thirty-two pounds felt manageable in the church parking lot. It was not manageable on a switchback. My shoulders were bruised. My hips were raw. Ruth had barely made three miles, and her pack was the lightest.

We went through everything. The psychology of discarding was harder than the weight itself — everything felt essential until you'd carried it uphill. The shovel felt essential. The extra water felt essential. The big cans of soup that weighed twice what the freeze-dried meals weighed felt essential because they were *food* and food was the thing you thought about constantly and the thought of leaving food behind was physically painful.

We left the shovel. The extra water containers. The second pot. The heavy cans — we ate what we could that night, added them to the stew, forced ourselves full. Two of the three tents went; we'd keep one for Ruth and Caleb and sleep under tarps. The redundant paracord. A bag of tools nobody had used. By the time we were done, the discard pile looked like a yard sale on a sandstone shelf, and the packs were five pounds lighter, and five pounds was the difference between arriving and not.

"All you think about when you're walking is food," Marcus said, watching the pile. "All you think about when you're resting is gear. What you can drop. What you don't need. That's hiking. That's the whole thing."

Jim held a prayer. Short: "Thank you for this day. Thank you for these legs. Particularly Ruth's, which performed heroically."

Ruth: "My legs do not require divine commentary."

Jim: "They're getting it anyway."

Marcus lit a small fire — carefully, in a depression in the rock, the smoke rising into the canopy and dispersing. "No population up here," he said. "Nothing to attract. And the smoke disperses in the canopy before it clears the trees." He'd built fires on overnight hauls, sleeping by the side of his truck. He knew which fires were safe and which weren't, the same way he knew which roads flooded and which ridgelines were exposed.

Caleb fell asleep in Dale's lap, the beagle in one hand and the half-finished cardinal in the other. Dale's hands shook and he held the boy steady and the tremor in his hands didn't travel to the child, and the effort of keeping the two things separate — the shaking and the holding — was visible in his face as a tightness that nobody mentioned.

Marcus pointed at the sky. "Orion," he said. To Caleb, who was asleep and couldn't hear. "Rising in the east. See the belt — three stars in a line. And there —" He pointed. "The Pleiades. Seven sisters. My dispatcher used to call me the seventh sister because I was always the last one in." He said this to the sleeping boy and to nobody else, and the constellations were there — brighter than I'd ever seen them, brighter than I knew stars could be, because there was no light pollution for fifty miles in any direction and the sky was doing the thing it had always been doing and we'd just been too busy to see.

We talked for a long time that night. Not about the trail or the plan or the Turned — about before. Ruth told us about her husband, Gerald, who had died in 2019, and how he'd made the worst coffee in Johnson County and she'd drunk it every morning for forty-one years and never told him. Marcus described the first time he saw Ava walk — three steps from the coffee table to the couch, arms out, face split with a grin that was nothing like the grin the Turned wore because it was real, it was *for* something, and the difference between a smile that means joy and a smile that means nothing is the entire distance between us and them. Maria talked about growing up in El Paso and how her mother had organized the kitchen by color and how she'd thought it was crazy until she grew up and organized everything by system and realized she was her mother's daughter after all.

Jim said, "My wife's name was Eleanor. Not the same Eleanor. She made peach cobbler that could make you believe in God." That was all he said about her. It was enough.

Sienna leaned against my shoulder at some point and neither of us acknowledged it. The fire had burned low and the warmth was on one side and the November cold was on the other and the shoulder contact was a small, specific thing that didn't mean anything except that it meant everything.

"What are you thinking about?" she asked. Quiet. Just for me.

"Nothing."

"You're a bad liar." She said it without the sharpness — without the reprimand voice, the fierce-eyed challenge. She said it like someone who was worried. "You've been somewhere else all day. Even on the switchbacks. Like — you were there, but you weren't."

I almost told her. Almost said: *I'm angry all the time and the anger is the only reason I made it up the mountain today and that scares me.* But telling her would mean explaining the parking lot, which would mean saying *my mother* out loud, and I wasn't ready. The anger said I didn't need to be ready because ready was another word for soft.

"I'm tired," I said. "First day."

She studied me. Then she let it go — not because she believed me, but because she understood that pushing wouldn't work. Not tonight. She settled her head back against my shoulder and stayed.

I am putting this in the journal because it should contain the truth: I was sitting on a rock in the Boston Mountains at eleven o'clock at night with a girl's head on my shoulder and the Milky Way overhead and I was happy. Briefly, illogically happy. The anger was still there underneath, patient and dense. The happiness passed. The anger didn't. Both things on the record.

I wrote by firelight. The notebook was wrinkled from the septic tank and smelled faintly of things I wouldn't name. The pen was a ballpoint from Ruth's purse. The fire popped and the smoke rose and the stars were out and behind us the trail continued into the dark, climbing the next ridge, and the next, and the next.

I crawled into my sleeping bag on the foam pad and every muscle in my body announced its displeasure. Legs. Back. Shoulders. The specific, grinding ache of muscles that had been used for the first time and were now stiffening in the cold, contracting, turning into concrete. The pad kept me off the rock but didn't do much else — I could feel every contour of the sandstone through the foam, and the bag was warm enough but narrow, and I couldn't find a position where something wasn't pressing against something else.

The forest was not quiet. I'd thought forests were quiet — the peaceful silence of nature, the soothing sounds of the wild. This was a lie invented by people who had never slept in one. Something large crashed through the dead leaves thirty feet from camp. My heart rate jumped before Marcus said, from his post by the fire, "Possum." A five-pound marsupial that sounded like a bear stampede in dry oak leaves. An armadillo followed twenty minutes later — same thrashing, same cardiac event, same eventual identification. Then deer, their hooves cracking sticks in the dark. Then something unidentified that rustled and stopped and rustled and stopped and I never found out what it was and lay in the dark imagining options until my body surrendered to exhaustion and the imagination shut off.

We all smelled like smoke and sweat. The fire provided warmth for whoever was on watch — Marcus took first shift, Jim second — but the smoke got into everything. Hair. Sleeping bags. Clothes. The smell would be our constant companion. I'd stop noticing it by Day 3.

That night I dreamed I was in the trailer. Everything was right — the paneling, the counter, the burn mark. But the trailer was moving. Not on wheels — being dragged, the whole structure shuddering, the floor tilting, and through the kitchen window the trees were not the park's trees but the OHT forest, oaks and hickories scrolling past as the trailer was pulled through terrain it was never built for. I could hear the skirting tearing underneath, the vinyl shredding against rock, and I ran to the back door and opened it and the drop was not the gravel lot but a ravine, a hundred feet of empty air, and the trailer was sliding toward the edge and I couldn't stop it because you can't stop a house.

I woke to the sound of wind in the canopy and for three heartbeats I didn't know which world was real — the forest or the trailer — and my hand found my wrist and counted and the count was high, one-ten, one-oh-six, and I lay still and watched the fire embers and breathed until the numbers came down and the trailer dissolved and I was on a rock in the Boston Mountains and the stars were the only things that hadn't changed.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #13:**

*I started to write this entry as a joke about throwing up on the switchback. Caught myself. The self-deprecating deflection — Sienna called it building the case for my own helplessness and she was right. I'm still doing it automatically, the way you bite your nails. So: I threw up and then I kept walking. The throwing up was what happened. The not-stopping was what I did. Those are different things. I'm trying to learn the difference.*

*I have identified a motivational resource I did not previously have access to. That's how I'm going to describe it because describing it accurately would require writing words I'm not ready to see in my own handwriting. It converts physical pain into something I can use rather than something I endure. I don't know if it's sustainable and I don't know if it's healthy and right now I don't care because it kept me on the trail.*

*Fifty-seven miles to go, then thirty-five on the highway. At three miles a day, Ruth's medication runs out before we get there. The math never quite works. We walk anyway.*

# Chapter 20: The Trail

The second morning was worse than the first. Every body said *no.* Ruth couldn't stand without Jim pulling her up. Dale's hands were shaking hard enough that he couldn't grip the zipper on his sleeping bag. Caleb was the only one who bounced up without complaint, because seven-year-olds are made of rubber and injustice.

But this was the first of many things the trail taught by repetition: the body lies in the morning. It says *you can't do this.* You do it anyway, and within a mile the joints loosen and the muscles warm and the lie becomes yesterday's pain rather than today's impossibility. By the third day I stopped believing the morning. By the fifth I stopped noticing it.

---

Days on the trail settled into a relentless rhythm.

The mornings were the same: stiff, cold, sore. Pack up the tarps and pads, stuff the sleeping bags, eat something — usually a handful of trail mix or a packet of instant oatmeal cooked on the camp stove with creek water. Never enough. The food was never enough. Freeze-dried meals were light and compact and tasted like salted nothing and the portions were designed for recreational hikers who would eat a real dinner afterward, not for people whose dinner was another freeze-dried packet. We ate everything heavy first — the canned goods that had survived the gear purge, the denser bars — to lighten the packs as quickly as possible. By Day 4, the packs were lighter. The hunger was not.

All you think about when you're walking is food. What you ate, what you'll eat, what you wish you were eating. Marcus talked about truck-stop diners — chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, coffee that was always too hot and never strong enough. Ruth described Gerald's meatloaf in a level of detail that should have been illegal. Caleb requested, repeatedly, "chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs." The conversations happened on the downhill, when breathing was easier. On the uphills, nobody spoke.

The trail was roots and rocks and more roots. The white blazes — aluminum diamonds nailed to trees — marked the path, and Marcus read them instinctively, the way he read road signs. Where the blazes faded or the path split, he stopped and studied the ground — boot prints, worn bark, the subtle compression of soil that said *people walked here* — and chose, and was always right. The trail crossed creeks every few miles, sometimes on stepping stones, sometimes on fallen logs, sometimes through the water itself.

The creek crossings became ritual. Stop. Remove shoes and socks. Bag your dry clothes. Cross barefoot or in camp sandals, using the hiking poles for balance, helping each other across. Dry your feet, check for cuts, put on dry socks — carefully, no wrinkles, no pebbles, because a wrinkle in a sock becomes a blister in a mile and a blister becomes the difference between making distance and not. We became obsessive about socks. Dry socks were gold. We carried extras in ziplock bags and inspected our feet at every stop with the meticulous seriousness of people on a medication timeline that tightened with every lost mile.

Sienna did not get blisters. She crossed the creeks with the sure-footed grace of a person whose body and the terrain were on speaking terms. The rest of us plodded. Sienna sauntered.

At a creek crossing on Day 4, she brought me water. I was sitting on a rock on the far side, drying my feet, the routine sock inspection, and she appeared with her water bottle and held it out without saying anything. I'd drunk all of mine on the last uphill. She'd noticed. I hadn't asked.

"Thanks," I said.

"You push too hard on the uphills," she said. Not a reprimand — an observation. Different voice. "You don't have to punish yourself up every grade. A slower pace covers the same distance."

"I'm not punishing myself."

"You are, though." She sat beside me on the rock, pulling her socks on. Her hands were efficient, practiced — the sock smooth, no wrinkles, the motion automatic. "You walk like you're trying to hurt yourself. Like the pain is the point. It's not the point, Nate. The point is getting there."

I didn't answer because she was right and I didn't want her to be right and the anger said: *the pain IS the point. The pain is what you owe. Getting there is what you owe them.* She waited for an answer that didn't come, then touched my shoulder — briefly, lightly, the way you'd touch someone who might flinch — and went back to her position in the line.

She'd been doing this. Small things. The water. A hand on my arm at a steep descent. Walking beside me on the downhills even when the trail narrowed, talking about nothing — her track coach's obsession with split times, the specific physics of a 400-meter race, how the third turn was where you either committed or died. She was trying to pull me out of wherever I'd gone. She could see I was somewhere she couldn't reach, and her instinct — the same instinct that made her sprint through a herd of Turned to save Caleb — was to close the distance.

I let her talk. I gave her the half-smile she was looking for. The anger stayed where it was.

---

Dale was bad by Day 3.

The Suboxone had been gone for two days and the withdrawal was no longer a tremor in the hands. It was a full systemic event — sweating despite the cold, muscles cramping, a nausea that bent him double every thirty minutes. The textbook described opioid withdrawal as "profoundly uncomfortable but rarely life-threatening." The textbook hadn't considered a world where withdrawal symptoms — the anxiety spike, the autonomic activation, the flood of stress hormones — were the exact biochemical signature that could convert you.

We managed it. Propranolol for the heart rate. Clonazepam for the acute anxiety. Jim's breathing exercises, which Dale performed with the grim determination of a man who had spent twelve years in recovery and was not going to let pharmacology undo it. But the management was imperfect. Dale's resting heart rate was 94 — higher than anyone's in the group, dangerously close to the range where the organism might start paying attention.

He walked. He carved. The cedar piece had become a fox — ears back, body low, running. The strokes were rougher on the uphills, when the exertion layered on top of the withdrawal and his hands shook worse, but the shape was there. His hands shook and the fox emerged anyway.

The trail and the withdrawal were the same thing. Both were survived by putting one foot in front of the other. Both punished you for stopping. Both lied — told you the pain was permanent, that the suffering was the destination rather than the road. Dale had been doing this for twelve years. The trail was just a new surface for the same walk.

"Rock bottom was just training," he said, on the fourth night, sitting by the fire with the fox in his hands. "Turns out every meeting I went to, every check-in, every time I sat with a craving and didn't use — I was practicing for this. The craving is the same thing. The fear, the chemical demand, the body screaming at you to do the thing that will kill you because it feels like relief. Same mechanism. Different substance."

That night he taught us HALT.

"Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired," he said. The fire was small — a depression in sandstone, the smoke threading up into the canopy. Dale's hands were shaking but his voice was steady — the voice he'd used in meetings, in the daily practice of staying alive. "You don't make decisions in those states. Any of those states. Your brain lies to you when you're hungry. It lies differently when you're angry. And when you're tired — when you're exhausted and scared and the whole world is wrong — your brain will tell you the stupidest idea you've ever had is the only option."

He looked around the fire. "How many of you are hungry right now?"

Everyone.

"Angry?"

Ruth raised her hand. Maria almost did.

"Lonely?"

Nobody raised their hand. Nobody needed to.

"Tired?"

Everyone.

"That's four for four. You're all in HALT right now. Every decision you make tonight is compromised. So here's what we do: we don't make decisions tonight. We eat, we sleep, we make decisions tomorrow when at least one of those four is resolved. In recovery we call this 'urge surfing' — you ride the urge without acting on it. The urge passes. It always passes. The bad decision doesn't."

He paused. The fire popped.

"Tired is the most dangerous of the four," he said. "Tired is the one that feeds the others. You can manage hunger, you can manage anger, you can manage loneliness — if you're rested. But tired means sleep, and sleep means your chemistry goes unsupervised. In recovery, we relapse at night. In this —" He gestured at the dark beyond the fire. "In this, tired means the watch rotation matters more than anything. The person who stays awake so the rest of us can sleep is the person who keeps the chemistry supervised. The most important job we have is the one nobody wants — sitting in the dark, watching people breathe, making sure nobody's brain decides to betray them while they're dreaming."

Jim, from his side of the fire: "That sounds like faith."

Dale looked at him. "It sounds like data. The relapse rate for decisions made in HALT states is over seventy percent. That's not faith. That's statistics."

"Statistics and faith aren't —"

"Mutually exclusive," the group said, more or less in unison, and Jim laughed — a real laugh, surprised and warm — and the fire popped and the stars turned and we didn't make any decisions.

---

On Day 5, the trail crossed Highway 23. A road crossing — the exposed moments Marcus had warned about. We descended from the ridgeline in the late morning, glassed the highway from the tree line, saw two Turned drifting a quarter mile south, waited until they'd moved further off, then crossed the pavement at a fast walk. Forty seconds of exposure. The asphalt felt alien underfoot after days of packed earth and rock.

Then the climb. The trail went straight up — steeper than anything we'd done, a relentless grade that switchbacked through hardwoods and then hit bare rock, hand-over-hand scrambling on sandstone ledges with packs threatening to pull us backward off the mountain. Ruth needed help. Marcus took her pack. Jim took her arm. She climbed with her teeth set and her walking stick jammed into every crevice and the sound of her knees was audible over the wind.

Near the top, the trail leveled and passed through a thicket of cedars, and the Rock House Shelter appeared.

It was built into the bluff — a massive natural rock overhang, thirty feet deep and sixty feet wide, the sandstone ceiling curving overhead like the inside of a wave frozen in stone. In the back, a spring seeped from the rock face, the water trickling down into a shallow basin someone had carved or enlarged generations ago. And across the front of the overhang, stacked stone walls — three walls with three doorways, the stones fitted without mortar, built by loggers in the early 1900s who had worked these mountains with crosscut saws and mule teams and needed somewhere to sleep. Some sections had collapsed — a pile of tumbled stones on the east end, a gap in the west wall where a tree root had pushed through. But the structure was mostly intact. Flat cement floor. A fire pit, blackened with a century of use. The ceiling was smoked dark from a hundred years of campfires.

"Oh," Ruth said. She said it the way you'd say it if you'd been sleeping on cold sandstone for four nights and someone showed you a room with a floor and a roof.

We stayed two nights. Marcus made the call — we were ahead of the medication schedule, barely, and Ruth needed recovery time and Dale needed the spring water and the flat floor and all of us needed the specific mercy of a place that wasn't open to the sky.

The shelter was dry when the rain came. It came on the second afternoon — a cold November storm, the kind the Ozarks produce without warning, the temperature dropping ten degrees in an hour and the rain falling in sheets that turned the trail into a creek. We sat inside the shelter with a fire in the pit and the rain hammering the forest outside and the water running past the doorways in rivulets and we were dry. For the first time in five days, nobody was wet or cold or sleeping on uneven ground.

The loggers had built this a hundred years ago. They'd cut timber, slept here, moved on. The shelter remained. Other people had come — their graffiti was on the walls, dates and initials, the oldest I could find reading 1947. People had been passing through these mountains and leaving temporary marks for a century, and the mountain absorbed them all and the shelter waited for the next ones.

We were the next ones. We wouldn't be the last.

Dale carved by firelight. The fox was finished. He'd started a turtle — the shell emerging in careful hexagonal plates. His hands were steadier. Not still — not yet — but the tremor was fading, the withdrawal's peak passing the way Dale had said it would: not all at once, but in increments, five minutes at a time.

"Recovery dreams," he said, quietly, turning the turtle in the firelight. "I dream about using. Every night. Not drugs — the knife. In the dream, the knife is the wrong shape. The blade curves where it shouldn't. And the wood won't hold a form — I carve and carve and the shavings fall and the shape underneath is always the same shapeless lump." He turned the turtle. The shell was precise. The real thing was more durable than the dream. "They don't stop. They just change what you're recovering from."

Maria put her hand on his knee. Deliberate, firm, the hand of a woman who had spent six years watching this man fight something invisible and had learned that the fight sometimes needed a physical anchor.

---

On Day 7 we encountered our first Turned on the trail.

Marcus spotted him first. A tree stand, twenty feet up in a white oak, fifty yards off the trail. The man was still in it — hunting camo, harness buckled, a compound bow across his lap. He'd been a hunter. He'd turned in the woods, probably in the first week, the fear catching up to him alone in his stand while the world below went wrong. He'd been sitting up there for weeks. The camo was filthy. His boots were still laced.

Marcus raised a fist — the stop signal — and we froze. Eight people on a narrow trail, packs on our backs, watching a Turned man in a tree stand watching us.

The head-turn was slow. The smile appeared. And then something I hadn't seen before: the hunter moved with purpose. Not the aimless drift, not the gravitational pull. He swung his legs off the platform and climbed down — hand under hand, the harness jerking against the tree as he descended, the compound bow falling from his lap and clattering through branches to the forest floor. His movements were fluid. Practiced. The muscle memory of a man who had climbed in and out of tree stands a thousand times, encoded so deep that even the organism couldn't erase it.

He hit the ground and stood. The smile was fixed. The head was tilted, tracking us the way it had tracked deer from the stand — that patient, predatory assessment, the hunter's calculation of distance and angle and approach. Then he began to move. Not toward us. Parallel. Through the trees, thirty yards off the trail, matching our pace, his boots silent on the leaf litter in a way that said he'd spent his whole life walking quietly in these woods.

"He's stalking us," I said.

Marcus nodded. "Hunting pattern. He's looking for the straggler."

The straggler was me. Or Ruth. Or Caleb. The organism had taken a man who knew how to hunt whitetail in these mountains and repurposed the skill — the patience, the positioning, the instinct for the vulnerable target. We were the herd.

We kept walking. He kept pace. Through the trees I caught glimpses — camo moving between trunks, the deliberate placement of feet, the tilted head tracking. He wasn't rushing. Hunters don't rush. They wait for the moment the prey separates, the instant the weak one lags, and then they close the distance.

"He's not going to stop," I said.

"No," Marcus said.

"If we keep walking, he follows. If Ruth falls behind, or Caleb — if anyone separates from the group for even a minute —"

"I know."

"We have to kill him."

The sentence came out flat and certain and the anger inside me said *yes.* The thing with edges that had been looking for a target since Clarksville. The hunter was a target. The hunter was the organism wearing a man's body and using a man's skills to stalk a seven-year-old boy, and the anger wanted him dead with a clarity that frightened me and also didn't frighten me enough.

Marcus looked at me. Something in my voice — the eagerness, the way I'd said "have to" when I meant "want to" — registered in his expression. He was calibrating whether the fifteen-year-old beside him was making a tactical decision or an emotional one.

"He's right," Sienna said, from behind us. Her voice was quiet. "He'll pick someone off. It's what they do when they're alone — they hunt. The collective ones herd. The solitary ones stalk." She'd been watching the Turned longer than anyone except me. She knew the behavioral modes. "If we don't deal with him now, we deal with him tonight. In the dark. When he has every advantage."

Marcus unslung the crossbow. None of us were experienced with it — Marcus had practiced in the church yard, hitting a target at twenty yards maybe six times out of ten, and a target that stood still in good light was not a man in camo moving through hickories at forty yards.

The hunter was circling — tightening the arc, closing toward the rear of the column where Ruth and Jim walked and Caleb rode on Dale's shoulders. Marcus stepped off the trail, found a shooting line between two oaks, raised the crossbow, and fired.

The bolt hit the hunter's shoulder. Not the chest — the shoulder, high, punching through the camo and spinning him sideways. He went down to one knee. And then the sound started.

I'd never heard a solitary Turned vocalize at full volume. In herds, the drone was collective — distributed, ambient, a sound that came from everywhere. This was one throat producing a sound that was not a scream and not a word and not anything a human larynx should have been able to sustain. A call. A signal, broadcasting to any collective within range: *here. Prey. Come.* The forest rang with it — birds erupted from the canopy, a squirrel bolted up the nearest oak, and the sound carried through the hollow like a siren.

"Again," I said. "Now."

Marcus was already reloading — fumbling the bolt into the rail, hands not quite steady, the cocking mechanism stiff. The hunter was back on his feet. The bolt in his shoulder didn't slow him — the Turned didn't process pain the way we did, the organism overriding the body's damage signals. He was moving toward us now. Not stalking. Charging. The patience was gone, replaced by the direct approach of a predator that had been wounded and was closing the distance before it could be wounded again.

Marcus fired. The second bolt hit the hunter's thigh. He stumbled, went down, got back up. The call was still going — that sustained, inhuman broadcast, and I was counting seconds in my head, calculating range, wondering how far the sound carried in these hollows and whether anything was close enough to hear and respond.

"There's nothing within range," Sienna said, reading my face. "We haven't seen Turned in two days. The nearest population center is twenty miles east."

She was probably right. The forest had been empty. But "probably" was not a word that kept people alive.

"Dale, take Caleb to the far side of the group," I said. "Ruth, Jim — stay behind Marcus. Sienna, with me."

I pulled the hatchet from my belt. The Atwoods hatchet — small, meant for splitting kindling, the handle wrapped in rubber grip tape. I'd been carrying it for seven days and hadn't used it for anything except chopping firewood. I walked toward the hunter.

He was on the ground, both bolts in him, dragging himself forward on his hands, the call still pouring from his throat. The camo was dark with blood. The tree stand harness trailed behind him, snagging on roots. His face was tilted up — the smile, always the smile — and his hands were reaching and the reaching was the hunting reflex, the grab, the instinct to close on prey that the organism had preserved and repurposed.

I hit him with the hatchet. Ugly, desperate, nothing like the way Marcus handled tools. It took a second swing and then a third, and the sound of it was the worst sound I had ever made. His hand grabbed my ankle — the grip of a man who had hauled deer out of ravines — and I hit him again and the grip released and he was still.

The call stopped. The forest was quiet. A bird — startled from its perch by the noise — returned to a branch overhead and sat there, watching.

I was breathing hard. My hands were shaking — the exertion shake. The hatchet was in my right hand and my right hand was covered in — I'm not going to describe it. The journal should contain the truth but the truth has limits and this is one of them.

Sienna was beside me. She didn't touch me. Close enough that I could feel her presence, far enough that the closeness was a choice. She waited.

"Don't look," Dale was saying, somewhere behind us, his hand over Caleb's eyes, and Caleb was crying — not the sharp cry of a fall on the trail but the sustained, bewildered cry of a child who had heard sounds that children should not hear.

I looked down at the hunter. The camo. The harness. The compound bow, still lying where it had fallen from the tree stand. A man who had sat in a tree and waited for deer and who had been good at waiting and whose patience had survived the conversion and whose patience had almost been turned on a seven-year-old boy.

The hatchet in my hand. The blood. The body in the leaves. The physical reality of killing — the sound, the resistance, the way a human body does not want to stop being a body — was nothing like the clean calculations in the notebook. This was meat and bone and the horror of doing violence with your hands rather than your mind.

And underneath the horror — satisfaction. Small, cold, precise. The organism had lost one body. One set of hunting skills it couldn't repurpose. One threat that would never circle back to Caleb in the dark. The satisfaction and the horror occupied the same space and neither displaced the other.

Jim prayed. He knelt in the leaves beside the body and put his hand on the man's shoulder and prayed for a hunter who had died twice — once when the organism took him, once when a fifteen-year-old with a hatchet finished what a crossbow had started — and the prayer was for both deaths, and Jim's face when he stood up was the face of a man who was keeping a tab that was getting longer.

Then we waited.

Nobody said it. Nobody had to. The call had gone out — that sustained, inhuman broadcast — and the call had carried through the hollow for God knows how far, and if anything was in range, anything at all, it would be coming. Marcus held the crossbow loaded, scanning the tree line. Sienna stood at the edge of the trail, listening. I stood with the hatchet still in my hand because I hadn't figured out yet how to put it down.

Five minutes. The forest was quiet. Wind in the canopy. A creek somewhere below us, the sound of water over rock. Nothing else. No drone. No footsteps in the leaves. No head-turns through the trees. Sienna had been right — the nearest population center was twenty miles east, and the trail had been empty for days. The call had gone out and nothing had answered.

"Clear," Marcus said, after ten minutes. He lowered the crossbow. The word was a truck driver's word — the all-clear after checking mirrors, after verifying the lane was open. Professional. Final.

Marcus cleaned the crossbow bolts. He didn't look at me while he did it. Dale held Caleb and murmured the nothing-words that hold children together. Maria checked Ruth's pulse — routine, automatic, the nurse's instinct that kept running even when the world had stopped. I cleaned the hatchet on the leaves and put it back on my belt and my hand didn't want to let go of it and I made it let go.

I picked up the compound bow. It was where it had fallen from the tree stand — scuffed, the cam wheels caked with dirt, the string still taut. The quiver was on the platform above, and I climbed up to get it. Six broadhead arrows. The tree stand smelled like weeks of occupation — the specific, animal smell of a body that had sat in one place through rain and sun and the slow erasure of everything that had made it human. I slung the bow across my pack and clipped the quiver to the frame. Another weapon. Another weight. The pack dug harder into my shoulders and the extra pounds were a different kind of carrying — not gear, not food, not the logistical weight Maria had calculated and distributed. This was the weight of what I'd taken from the body on the ground, and I carried it the way I carried everything now: silently, without asking whether I should.

We walked on. Behind us, the hunter lay in a wash of late-afternoon light — the golden hour, the sun low enough to turn the oak canopy into stained glass, bronze and amber, the light falling in shafts through the thinning leaves and landing on the forest floor in warm pools. A breeze came through the hollow, cool and gentle, carrying the smell of dead leaves and cedar and the faint mineral sweetness of the creek below. A cardinal landed on a branch ten feet from the body. It sang — two notes, a pause, two notes — the territorial call, bright and clean and utterly indifferent. The forest was doing the thing it had always done: being beautiful. The golden light on the hillside. The birdsong. The cool November air that tasted like nothing had ever gone wrong. And on the ground beneath it, in the same light, the body — camo dark and wet, the hatchet marks visible, the tree stand empty above him like a pulpit nobody would use again. The beauty did not pause for what we'd done. The violence did not diminish the beauty. The two things existed in the same frame and the frame held them without comment, the way these mountains had held a century of logging and hunting and living and dying without ever changing their expression. I turned away. The image stayed — the cardinal singing over the body in the golden light, the blood splatterd on the fall leaves... and it would stay for a long time.

I walked and I thought about what I had done with my hands. On the long, flat ridgeline stretches where the mind has nothing to do but think, I knew this was not what I wanted to become. The satisfaction was real. The anger that had fueled me since Clarksville was real and useful — it had kept me on the trail, put the hatchet in my hand. But somewhere between the necessity and the satisfaction, there was a line. On one side, a person who killed because he had to. On the other, a person who killed because it felt like the world owed him violence. Those two people were standing very close together and I could not tell which one was holding the hatchet.

The mountains don't care what happens on their surface. That's not cruelty. That's patience. I needed some of that patience for myself.

---

The oaks were bronze and amber, the last of the fall color hanging on in the sheltered hollows where the frost hadn't reached. The hickories were bare — silver branches against blue sky, the kind of clean, geometric beauty that made you understand why people painted trees. The air was cold and clear and tasted like nothing — no exhaust, no generator fumes, no smoke from burning houses. Just air. The kind of air that had been here before people and would be here after.

On the ridgelines, the views opened up and the world was enormous. Layer after layer of blue ridges extending to the horizon, each one lighter than the last, the farthest ones almost indistinguishable from sky. It looked like a place where nothing bad had ever happened. A beautiful lie.

On clear days, the walking was almost enjoyable. The rhythm of it. The breathing. The way the mind went blank on the long stretches where the trail was easy and the pack was manageable and you could just walk and think about nothing. After weeks of hypervigilance, the brain could idle, and the idling was rest.

On the afternoon after the hunter, I caught Sienna looking at me. She was walking ahead, in her usual position behind Marcus, and she glanced back and the expression on her face was one I hadn't seen before. Concern, yes — but underneath it, something that looked like fear. Fear of me.

She'd watched me call for the hunter's death. She'd watched me walk toward him with the hatchet. She'd watched me swing it — not once, not cleanly, but the ugly repeated work of someone who didn't know how to kill efficiently and did it anyway. And she'd watched me afterward — the way I'd stood over the body and hadn't looked away, the way I'd climbed the tree stand and taken his bow, the way I'd cleaned the hatchet and put it back on my belt with hands that were steady when they shouldn't have been.

She was trying to reconcile two people. The boy from the trailer park who sat at a window and wrote in a notebook and made self-deprecating jokes and let her lean against his shoulder under the stars. And the boy on the trail who'd said "we have to kill him" with an eagerness that didn't belong in a fifteen-year-old's voice, who was carrying a dead man's bow on his pack and walking faster because of it.

She turned forward without saying anything. The distance between us on the trail was thirty yards and the distance between us in every other way was something I couldn't measure and didn't know how to close.

Conversations happened on the downhill, when breathing was easier. Marcus told stories about hauling loads through these mountains — the grades that killed transmissions, the ice storms that turned the passes into skating rinks, the time he jackknifed a trailer on a switchback and had to wait six hours for a tow truck that never came. Ruth corrected everyone's grammar. Caleb asked questions about everything — why trees lost their leaves, why the creek water was brown, why rocks had stripes — and Jim answered each one with the patient, slightly inaccurate explanations of a man who cared more about engaging curiosity than being correct.

The pace built. Three miles the first day. Four on the second. By Day 7 we were making five, sometimes six, the bodies adapting the way Marcus had promised, the legs finding their strength, the lungs expanding, the rhythm settling into something sustainable. Even Ruth moved faster — not by much, but measurably, her walking stick planted with more confidence, her steps surer on the rocks.

I lost weight. Not dramatically — maybe five pounds, maybe eight — but enough that my pants were looser and the pack felt lighter and the uphills were incrementally less catastrophic. The chafing faded as the jeans broke in and my thighs toughened. The shoulder bruises hardened into something that hurt less. The body was adapting. The body I'd been apologizing for was doing the thing I needed it to do, and the doing was changing it, and the changing was its own kind of answer to the question Sienna had asked in the church parking lot.

By Day 8, Dale's hands were steady. Not still — not completely — but the tremor had faded to something you'd only notice if you were looking for it, and I was always looking. The worst had passed. The sweating had stopped. The cramping had eased. His heart rate was down to 82 — still elevated, but manageable, safe. He carved the turtle with clean, controlled strokes, the hexagonal plates of the shell emerging with the precision his hands hadn't been capable of three days earlier.

"How long?" I asked. Meaning: how long have your hands been still.

Dale looked at his hands. Turned them over. Studied them the way you'd study a landscape you'd been traveling through and only now recognized.

"Two days," he said. "Maybe three." He held up the knife. "The trail helped. Keeping the hands busy. Keeping the body moving. It's the same thing my counselor taught me in year one: don't think about the craving. Think about the next five minutes. Do something with your hands. The craving passes. The five minutes become ten. The ten become an hour. The hour becomes a day you didn't use."

In the morning the world was slightly less wrong than it had been the night before.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #14:**

*I've stopped counting miles. Counting is another version of the laziness — measuring how much suffering remains instead of accepting that the suffering is the method and the method is working.*

*The worst thing that happened to Dale gave him the exact skills this world requires. Wrong reasons. Right answers. The pattern holds.*

*The forest is beautiful. I want that recorded because the journal has been a catalog of horrors and the forest deserves better. The oaks are bronze. The ridgelines are blue. The air tastes like nothing and nothing is the best thing I've tasted in a month.*

*I told Marcus we had to kill the hunter. The decision was correct. But I wanted it. When I said "we have to kill him," the emphasis in my head was on "kill," not "have to." I hated it and it felt satisfying and both of those are true at the same time. Somewhere between the necessity and the satisfaction there is a line and I don't know which side I'm facing. The person on the wrong side of it is not someone my mother would recognize.*

*Jim prayed for him. Jim always prays for them. Jim is the line — the person who does the necessary thing and carries the cost without letting the cost change what he carries it with. I am not Jim. But I need to learn what Jim knows, or the thing with edges will become the only thing I am.*

*The envelope is open. I expected grief. I got grief and something else — something that paces where the grief sits still. The trail is where I use it. Every uphill. Every switchback. The thing with edges makes the pack lighter and I am not going to examine that too closely because I need it to work.*

*Sienna is trying to reach me the way you try to reach someone on the other side of a window. She doesn't know the window is there.*

I left what remans of my mother standing in the parking lot.  I don't know what to do about that.

*We walk.*

# Chapter 21: The Wolf Knife

Lake Fort Smith was a man-made lake at the bottom of the mountains — a dam, a spillway, a campground with bathrooms that still smelled like bleach and pine, and a gas station at the highway junction that had been looted for food but not for shopping carts. We took four. The wheels were stiff from sitting in the rain but they rolled, and rolling was the point: sixty miles of trail with packs on our backs had taught us the value of not carrying weight when you didn't have to.

The transition happened in an afternoon. We walked out of the forest and onto pavement and the difference was immediate — the shock of flat ground after two weeks of roots and rocks, the strange smoothness of asphalt under shoes that had molded to uneven terrain. Highway 71 stretched south toward Fayetteville, the old Pig Trail, two lanes of cracked blacktop winding through the mountains. It had been mostly abandoned since Highway 49 was built — the newer, wider road that bypassed the switchbacks and the small towns and the tourist traps that had once sold Ozark pottery and homemade fudge and wooden signs that said BLESS THIS MESS. The Pig Trail was a relic. Now it was our road.

Shopping carts on asphalt. The sound was absurd — that rattling, clattering grocery-store sound echoing off the mountain walls, announcing our presence to every Turned within a quarter mile. But the trade-off was worth it: packs in the carts, bodies upright, shoulders and hips finally unburdened after days of grinding. Ruth sat in her cart when her knees gave out, Maria pushing her, the two of them looking like the world's most unlikely grocery run.

The highway was a literal graveyard — cars sitting with their doors open, nobody coming back for them. A minivan in the left lane, both sliding doors wide, two car seats in the back, empty. A pickup nose-down in the drainage ditch, the cab half-submerged in standing water that had turned green. A Buick stopped diagonally across both lanes, driver's door open, keys still in the ignition, the battery long dead. The evidence of panic stops — people who pulled over, got out, and never got back in. Every open door was a sentence that ended mid-word.

We pushed the carts through the gaps. The wheels rattled over broken glass and around a suitcase that had split open on the shoulder, clothes scattered across the gravel — a woman's blouse, a pair of jeans, a child's sneaker with the laces still tied. A cell phone sat on the guardrail, screen cracked in a spiderweb pattern, placed there carefully by someone who had expected to come back for it. Nobody had come back.

The Turned were more numerous here. Closer to population centers, closer to the small towns strung along the highway like beads on a wire. We saw them among the cars — singles and pairs drifting through the lanes like shoppers in an abandoned lot. One sat in a driver's seat with both hands on the steering wheel, staring through the windshield, going nowhere. Another stood at a gas pump outside a Shell station, a credit card in her right hand, the ritual of fueling preserved without function. She swiped the card against the dead reader while we passed. Swiped it again. The motion was smooth, practiced, the muscle memory of a thousand fill-ups persisting after everything else had been taken.

We gave them wide berth, pushing the carts onto the shoulder, into the gravel, waiting for them to pass. The highway was exposed — no tree cover, no ridgelines to hide behind — but it was fast. Seven miles the first day. Eight the second. The flat ground and the cart wheels were doing what the trail couldn't.

On the second day we came around a curve and found the food truck.

It had jackknifed across both lanes — a converted box truck, faded red, the side panel reading UNCLE DEL'S SMOKEHOUSE in hand-painted letters that were peeling at the edges. The back doors had burst open on impact and the contents had scattered across the highway — paper plates, napkins, plastic forks, an industrial-sized jug of barbecue sauce that had shattered and left a dark stain on the asphalt like old blood. The food was gone. Whatever had been edible — the meat, the bread, the coleslaw in plastic tubs — had been consumed. By Turned, by animals, by time. What remained was packaging and bones.

The bones were in the ditch. Not scattered — concentrated, the way debris collects in an eddy. Skulls and femurs and ribcages, some still connected, most not. Picked clean. The Turned feed — I knew this from observation, from the journal, from six weeks of data. But seeing the evidence was different from knowing it, and the evidence was thorough. The bones were pale in the November light. Some had tooth marks.

Caleb asked what they were and Marcus said "deer" without hesitating and the lie was so smooth and so necessary that nobody corrected it.

We passed the food truck by climbing the embankment on the right side, hauling the carts up through the gravel and weeds, and coming back down on the other side. The Turned in the area — four of them, drifting among the wreckage — didn't follow. They stayed near the truck, near the bones, near the residual smell of what had once been food. The organism's caloric drive, operating at the most basic level. Stay near the food source. Wait.

That evening, at camp, Marcus got a response on the CB.

He'd been trying every night since the trail — sitting apart from the fire, the handheld CB from the church pressed to his ear, cycling through channels, listening to static. On the trail the mountains had blocked the signal. On the highway the terrain opened up, and seven miles south of Lake Fort Smith, with a clear line of sight down the valley toward Fayetteville, the static broke.

"— repeat, this is University of Arkansas research station, Dr. Moss speaking. If you are receiving this broadcast —"

Marcus keyed the mic. "Dr. Moss. This is Marcus. Group of eight, coming south on 71 from the OHT. Church group out of Clarksville."

The pause was three seconds. It felt longer.

"Clarksville. How far out are you?"

"Two days. Maybe three. We've got an elderly woman and a child. Moving slow."

"Are you armed?"

"Lightly. Crossbow. Hatchets."

Another pause. Then: "We have an emitter running. Eighty-meter radius. When you reach the campus, approach from the north — Razorback Road. The emitter covers the life sciences building and the surrounding quad. Stay calm, keep your heart rates down, and come straight to us. I'll have the door open."

Marcus looked at me across the fire. The CB crackled with static and the faint hum of the frequency — audible even through the tiny speaker, a sound I'd never heard but that Jim had dreamed about on Day 7. A tuning fork pressed against the bones of the earth.

"Copy," Marcus said. "We'll be there."

He told her about the journal. Brief, factual — the way Marcus told everything. A kid had been writing down observations since Day One. Behavioral patterns, conversion mechanics, survival data. Six weeks of primary source material. Moss asked him to repeat that. He did.

"Bring the journal," she said. "Bring everything."

The CB went to static. Marcus clipped it to his belt and came back to the fire and didn't say anything for a while. Then he said, "She sounds tired."

"She's been broadcasting for six weeks," I said.

"Yeah." He poked the fire. "But she's still broadcasting."

---

On Day 37 A part of me I loved died, it started from a hillside, with a plan I'd borrowed from Eskimo hunters.

The roadblock appeared on the afternoon of the second day on the highway. We came around a long curve where the road cut through a ridgeline — blasted limestone faces on the right, a steep drop on the left where the mountain fell away — and the highway ahead was blocked.

The National Guard had been here.

I recognized the setup from the kind of reading I used to do — Wikipedia deep dives, military logistics, the organizational patterns of emergency response. Jersey barriers across both lanes, the heavy concrete dividers that separate highway traffic, arranged in a staggered pattern that forced approaching vehicles to slow and weave. Concertina wire spiraling around the perimeter in thick coils, the razor-sharp kind, military grade, designed to entangle and cut. Two Humvees inside the compound — one upright with its doors open, the other on its side, the undercarriage facing the hillside like a dead animal exposing its belly. A command tent, collapsed, the olive-drab canvas pooled on the ground. A generator, silent, fuel cans scattered around it. Sandbag positions at the corners, the bags split and leaking sand that mixed with the gravel.

They'd set up a checkpoint to control refugee flow. The highway was the secondary route between Alma and Fayetteville — not the interstate, not the main evacuation corridor, but the road people would take when the interstate was gridlocked. The Guard had positioned here to screen, direct, manage the flow. Then the flow had overwhelmed them, or the organism had, and the checkpoint had become a monument.

Cars were backed up on both sides. The north approach — our side — had a line of vehicles stretching back maybe a quarter mile, stopped in both lanes, some with doors open, some with the windows smashed. People who had stopped in time. Behind them, the evidence of people who hadn't: a sedan rear-ended into the back of a pickup, the hood crumpled, airbags deployed and hanging like deflated lungs. A semi that had jackknifed trying to stop, its trailer slewed across the shoulder, the cab hanging over the edge of the drop on the left. The guardrail was twisted where the semi had gone partially through it — bent metal, bolts sheared, a fifty-foot drop beyond to the rocks and scrub below. The semi's trailer dangled, half on the road, half over nothing.

The south side was the same. More cars, more doors, more evidence. The roadblock had trapped traffic from both directions, creating a parking lot of abandoned vehicles with a military compound in the center and no way through.

And among the cars, around the compound, on both sides of the roadblock — the Turned.

I counted from the hillside through the binoculars. The north side: approximately fifty, milling among the backed-up cars, drifting between open doors, sitting on hoods, standing at the guardrail looking at nothing. The south side: approximately fifty more, the same aimless drift, the same patient gravitational circling. Inside the compound itself: maybe thirty, wandering among the Humvees and the collapsed tent and the sandbag positions, drawn to the military infrastructure the way they were drawn to all human-built things.

A hundred and thirty. Maybe more. Three groups separated by the jersey barriers and the wire, each below frenzy threshold, each drifting in its own orbit. The terrain funneled them: the steep hillside on the right made climbing impractical, especially with shopping carts. The fifty-foot drop on the left, with the twisted guardrail and the semi wreckage, made that side impassable. The roadblock controlled the only viable passage.

The alternative was backtracking — north two miles, then east on a forest service road to bypass the ridgeline, then south on a county road to rejoin the highway below the roadblock. But the forest service road was unpaved, rutted, impossible with shopping carts. We'd have to carry the packs again. And the detour added half a day of exposed walking through open terrain where we'd already seen Turned drifting in from the surrounding towns. Ruth's atenolol supply was at four days. Four days of medication between her and a heart rate that would light up the organism like a signal flare.

I studied the compound for an hour. I studied the wire. I studied the three groups and their separation and the jersey barriers that kept them apart and the funnel geometry of the terrain and the coils of unused concertina wire stacked behind one of the Humvees — still bundled, never deployed, the military's surplus, left behind when the checkpoint fell.

The idea didn't arrive unwanted this time.

I'd read about it years ago, The Eskimo wolf knife. You take a knife blade, coat it in seal fat, freeze it upright in the snow. A wolf finds it, licks the fat. The blade cuts the wolf's tongue. The wolf tastes its own blood. The blood triggers a feeding response — the wolf can't stop licking. Each lick cuts deeper. The wolf bleeds to death from licking its own blood off the blade that's killing it.

The razor wire was the knife. The frenzy was the wolf.

I should say I didn't want it. That's what the journal should record — the reluctance, the moral weight, the boy who didn't want to become the kind of person who engineers a slaughter. And that boy existed. He was in there somewhere, behind the anger, behind the weeks of trail and the parking lot and the smile.

But the truth is more complicated than the boy.

Part of me had been waiting for this. The anger — the thing with edges that I'd carried since Clarksville, that had fueled every uphill, that had turned physical pain into something I used instead of something I endured — the anger had been looking for a target it could actually reach. Not the organism, which was everywhere and nowhere. Not myself, whose self-inflicted suffering on the trail was satisfying but pointless. The anger wanted something it could *do.* A way to punish the thing that had taken my mother, even if the punishment landed on the bodies the thing was wearing.  I would not yet know the cost.

The roadblock was the first opportunity I'd had to hurt it.

The analytical brain provided the method — the wire, the density mechanics, the frenzy threshold, the wolf knife principle. The math checked. But the eagerness was new. The eagerness came from the thing with edges, and it said: *yes. Finally. Make it hurt.*

I want it recorded that this frightened me. The math and the rage arrived at the same answer, and I couldn't tell which one I was listening to.
---

I proposed it to the group on the hillside, in the flat analytical voice I default to when what I'm saying is too large for inflection.

"There's an Eskimo hunting technique for wolves. You coat a knife in seal fat, freeze it in the snow. The wolf licks the fat, cuts its tongue, tastes blood, can't stop. Bleeds to death licking its own blood off the blade." I let that sit for a moment. "The razor wire is the knife. The frenzy is the wolf."

Silence. People hearing something they wished they hadn't.

"Three of us go in quiet. Me, Marcus, Dale. We unspool the extra wire inside the compound — there are unused coils behind the Humvee. Make the web denser. Then we open both gates — the north and south barriers. Create funnels. Then we find a car with a working battery in the traffic backup, start the stereo, blast music. Maximum draw. All three groups converge on the compound. A hundred and thirty Turned in a web of razor wire. The density hits threshold. They frenzy. The wire does the rest."

More silence. Nobody was prepared to hear this from a fifteen-year-old.

Jim spoke first. "Those are people, Nate."

"They were people." The sentence came out and I heard it cross a line. The detachment in my voice. The way I said "were" without flinching. I wanted to flinch. I couldn't afford to.

"They're still people," Jim said. "Somewhere in there, they're still —"

"Jim, I know. I know they have memories. I know the organism uses those memories. I know that somewhere inside each of them is a person who had a name and a family and a life. I know all of this. And I also know that between us and Fayetteville there are a hundred and thirty of them blocking the highway, and Ruth has four days of atenolol, and we can't carry the packs on an unpaved detour, and we don't have half a day to go around."

"There's always another way."

"There isn't always another way. Sometimes the other way is worse and the only honest thing to do is say so."

The argument expanded. Sienna opposed it on instinct. "It feels wrong. It feels like — Nate, you're talking about setting a trap. You're talking about using their own bodies against them."

"I'm talking about using the frenzy's own destructive behavior in a controlled context. The frenzy happens without us — it's happened at the Lyles', at the ranch house, at every concentration point I've observed. We're not creating a new threat. We're directing an existing one."

"That's a rationalization."

"Maybe. But it's also true."

Marcus, from his position at the edge of the group: "The detour adds half a day. Half a day carrying packs on unpaved roads with no cover. Ruth can't do it — not with four days of medication left."

Dale spoke. He was holding the fox carving — finished now, the detail work clean, the strokes precise with steady hands. "When I was using," he said, "my counselor told me that recovery means choosing the hard thing that works over the easy thing that feels right. This is the hard thing."

The group looked at him. Dale — weeks past withdrawal, hands steady, standing straighter than he had since Clarksville — had reframed the moral question with the vocabulary of a man who'd spent a decade learning to distinguish between what felt right and what was right. In recovery, the thing that feels right is the relapse. The hard thing — the meeting, the daily grind of choosing not to use — is the thing that works.

"This is the meeting," Dale said. "This is the part where you sit in the folding chair and you don't want to be there and you do the thing anyway because the alternative is worse."

Jim looked at Dale. Something passed between them — the pastor and the addict, two men who had spent their lives in folding chairs in basements, arriving at the same place from opposite directions.

"I won't be part of it," Jim said. Quiet. Certain. "I'll stay back with Ruth and Caleb. I'll pray."

"For us?" I asked.

"For them." He meant the Turned. He meant the hundred and thirty people at the roadblock who were about to die because a fifteen-year-old with a notebook had borrowed a wolf-hunting technique. "You do what you need to do, Nate. I'll do what I need to do. And if we're both right, God can sort out the difference."

Sienna would not or could not look at me.

---

We went in before dawn.

Marcus, Dale, and I slipped down the hillside in the dark, moving slow, breathing slow, threading between the backed-up cars on the north approach. The Turned on our side — fifty of them, scattered among the vehicles — were in drift mode, the aimless, passive circling that passed for rest. We moved through them the way we'd learned on the trail: no sudden movements, no eye contact, pulse steady, the body language of furniture. A Turned man stood three feet from me between a Honda and a Dodge, his head tilted, his eyes tracking nothing. I passed him close enough to smell him — the organism smell, the sweet rot, the biological wrongness — and he didn't register me. I was below his threshold. I was background noise.

The compound entrance was a gap in the jersey barriers on the north side, narrowed by concertina wire that the Guard had strung across the opening. Marcus held the wire up with a piece of two-by-four scavenged from the roadside while Dale and I crawled under. The razor edges caught my jacket, sliced the fabric, nicked the skin beneath. A thin line of blood on my forearm. The pain was familiar — the earned kind, the kind I'd been seeking since Clarksville. I didn't flinch.

Inside the compound, the thirty resident Turned drifted among the military wreckage. A woman in civilian clothes sitting on a sandbag. A man in National Guard fatigues — ACU pattern, the name tape too dark to read — standing at the generator, his hand on the pull-start, yanking it at intervals. The generator was out of fuel. The motion continued. Yank. Wait. Yank. Wait. The muscle memory of a soldier who had been told to keep the generator running and whose body was still following the last order it received.

We found the spare wire behind the overturned Humvee. Four coils of military concertina — the serious kind, the wire with the razor blades stamped into it at two-inch intervals, designed to entangle and lacerate anything that touched it. Each coil was heavy, sixty pounds of steel, compressed into a cylinder that expanded when you cut the binding straps. We cut the straps on two of them and the wire sprang outward in a controlled chaos of razor edges.

Unspooling concertina wire in the dark, quietly, among Turned, is not something I can describe without the word "careful" becoming inadequate. Dale held the expanding coil with leather gloves we'd found in the Humvee — military issue, thick, designed for exactly this work — while Marcus and I stretched the wire across the gaps between the barriers, between the Humvees, across the open ground inside the compound. The wire sang when it moved — a low, metallic hum, the kind of sound that carries. Every time it sang I stopped breathing and watched the nearest Turned for a reaction. No reaction. The sound was below their attention threshold, or close enough to the wind-in-the-wire sounds they'd been hearing for weeks that it didn't register as novel.

The wire cut us anyway. Through the gloves, through the jacket sleeves, through the careful spacing of hands that knew where the blades were. My palms bled. Dale's forearms bled. Marcus had a gash across the back of his right hand that he wrapped with a strip of his shirt without stopping. The pain was a tax. The blood was the cost of the plan. I noticed — the analytical brain noticed — that my hands were bleeding on the same wire that was about to kill a hundred and thirty people, and the symmetry of that was the kind of thing I would have written in the journal if I'd had the journal with me instead of a coil of razor wire.

We opened the gates. North side first — pulling the jersey barriers apart just enough to create a funnel, an invitation, a doorway that said *come in.* Then the south side, same thing. Two funnels. Two open mouths. The wolf knife, set in the snow.

The car took three tries. The first — a Camry in the backed-up traffic — was dead. The second — a Ford F-150 — was dead. The third — a Chevy Malibu, pushed sideways on the shoulder, the driver's door hanging open — turned over when Marcus hit the key. Not the engine — the engine was dry — but the electronics lit up. The dashboard glowed. The stereo came on.

Static. Marcus hit the CD button. A disc was still in the player.

Lynyrd Skynyrd. "Free Bird." The opening notes — the quiet ones, the piano and the guitar, the soft part before the song becomes what it becomes — filled the Malibu and spilled out through the open door and echoed off the limestone walls of the highway cut and carried, carried, carried into the November morning like a signal flare made of sound.

We ran.

Back through the wire — faster now, less careful, the razor edges catching and cutting and not mattering because the clock was running. Up the hillside, scrambling through scrub oak and dead leaves, Dale's breathing the recovery count — *in two three four, out two three four* — Marcus behind us with the crossbow up, watching the compound below. We reached the observation point — two hundred yards south, above the roadblock, the same hillside where the group was waiting — and I pulled up the binoculars and watched.

The Turned responded. The fifty on the north side oriented first — heads turning, bodies shifting, the collective attention rotating toward the sound like a field of sunflowers tracking the sun. They began to move. Not fast — the aimless drift accelerating into purposeful walking, still individual, still below threshold, but converging. Through the backed-up cars, around the open doors, toward the funnel we'd made in the north barrier. On the south side, the same: fifty more, turning, drifting, drawn by the music that was now loud enough to hear from the hillside — the guitar solo building, the drums coming in, the song becoming the anthem it was written to be, played for an audience of the dead.

The north group reached the funnel first. They filtered through the gap in the barriers — one at a time, then two, then a press of bodies, the funnel doing what funnels do, compressing the flow, accelerating it. Inside the compound, the resident thirty were already agitated — the music was loudest here, bouncing off the jersey barriers and the Humvees, and the incoming bodies were adding density, adding the proximity signals that the organism read as *converge, converge, converge.* The south group hit the south funnel seconds later. More bodies. More density. The compound was filling.

I counted. Sixty. Eighty. A hundred. The three groups were becoming one group, and the one group was compressed into a space designed to hold a military checkpoint, not a hundred human bodies, and the wire — our wire, the new web we'd strung in the dark — was everywhere, chest-high, knee-high, strung between the barriers in a geometry of edges.

The behavior changed. The twitchiness first — the restless, jerky movements I'd catalogued at the Lyles' and at every concentration point since. Heads snapping toward nothing. Hands opening and closing. The droning started. Low, resonant, building — a hundred human vocal cords producing a sound that was not speech and not song and not anything that had a name, a harmonic that built on itself, each voice amplifying the others, the acoustic signature of the threshold approaching.

"Free Bird" was still playing. The solo — the long, climbing, desperate solo that had filled a thousand arenas and a million car radios — was competing with the drone, and losing.

"It's happening," I said.

Dale was beside me. His hands were steady. His breathing was the recovery count. He was watching and his face was the face of a man who understood craving in all its forms and was choosing, again, the hard thing.

The shudder. The phase transition. One moment they were milling, individual, restless. The next they were a single thing — a collective body, convulsing, the coordinated patience of the herd snapping into the undirected violence of the frenzy. The sound changed: not the drone but a roar, multi-throated, the sound of a hundred human vocal cords producing something that was not a human sound.  The sound of vocal chords being shredded from pressure and rage.

They hit the wire.

Not because they were aiming — because the wire was what was there. The nearest strand took the first impact: bodies pressing into razor edges, the concertina biting into arms and torsos and faces with the mechanical indifference of engineered steel. The wire held — it was military concertina, designed to stop infantry, designed to entangle and lacerate, and it did both. Every movement drove the blades deeper. Arms tangled in the coils, legs wrapped in the lower strands, bodies pressing forward into the web because the frenzy said *move* and the wire said *stop* and the frenzy was stronger than pain.

The wolf knife.

They cut themselves open on the wire. The blades opened skin and muscle and the blood came — not in drops but in sheets, running down the razor edges, pooling on the asphalt, the smell of it rising in the November air. The blood made the wire slick. The slickness let them push deeper. The deeper they pushed, the more the blades cut, and the cutting produced more blood and the blood produced more frenzy and the frenzy produced more pressure and the pressure drove them harder into the wire. The self-destruction spiral. The soft hands of humans grabbing at cold spirals of razor blades, sliced fingers falling before them, then those same fingerless people were biting those same razors.  The wolf licking the blade. Unable to stop because the thing that was killing it was the thing it craved.

The guardrail went next. The left side of the roadblock — the fifty-foot drop, the twisted metal where the semi had already punched through — was the weakest point. The frenzied mass, a hundred bodies pressing and shoving and tearing with no direction and no purpose, crowded toward the edge. The guardrail, already bent, already sheared at the bolts, held for maybe thirty seconds. Then it folded outward like a gate and the bodies behind it didn't stop — couldn't stop, because the frenzy doesn't understand edges, doesn't understand gravity, doesn't understand that the ground disappears — and they went over. Dozens of them. Pushed by the crush behind them, carried by the momentum of a hundred bodies that had nowhere else to go. The sound of them hitting the rocks fifty feet below was — I heard it like a drum cadence for a song turned obscene. I will not describe it.

The compound was a slaughterhouse. The road surface was covered in blood — not splashes, not splatters, but a continuous layer, inches deep in the low spots where the asphalt dipped, pooling against the jersey barriers, running in dark rivulets into the drainage ditches on either side. Viscera hung from the razor wire — intestines caught on the blades, loops of tissue strung between the coils like grotesque garlands, the things inside people that are supposed to stay inside. The smell reached us on the hillside, two hundred yards away: blood and meat and shit, the smell of a body opened, multiplied by a hundred, compressed into a quarter-mile of highway. Maria turned away. Caleb was already on Marcus's back, face buried.

I watched through the binoculars. The analytical brain was recording. The rage was watching too, and for once, the rage was satisfied, the satisfaction frightened me more than the dying.

Then the others came.

I hadn't counted them because I hadn't seen them. They came from the woods on both sides — from the hillsides, from the hollows, from the county roads and forest service roads and the small towns scattered through the mountains between Alma and Fayetteville. People who had been fleeing on this secondary route when the organism caught them. People who had turned on the highway and wandered into the trees. People who had been drifting for weeks through the Ozark woods, alone or in pairs, drawn by nothing, going nowhere, until the sound of a hundred frenzied voices gave them somewhere to go.

They came in tens, then twenties. Through the tree line on the right. Up the embankment from the drop on the left — climbing, somehow, the ones who could still climb. From the backed-up cars on both approaches, emerging from vehicles I'd counted as empty. The count I'd done from the hillside — a hundred and thirty — had been the visible population. The actual population was the visible plus the invisible, the ones in the woods, the ones in the hollows, the ones I hadn't seen because I hadn't looked hard enough or far enough or with enough respect for the possibility that I was wrong.

The hundred and thirty became two hundred. Then three hundred. The compound couldn't hold them — the frenzy spilled out through the funnels we'd opened, but more kept coming, and the wire was everywhere, and the new arrivals hit the wire and the wire cut them and the blood and the frenzy and the wire did what the wolf knife does. The killing field expanded beyond the compound, into the backed-up cars on both sides, the frenzy radiating outward as the density wave propagated, catching new arrivals in the same self-destruction spiral.

I lowered the binoculars.

I glanced at Sienna.

She was already looking at me. Not the way she'd looked at me on the trail — the sidelong glances, the concern, the trying-to-read-him focus of a girl who cared about someone she couldn't quite reach. This was different. Her eyes were wide and wet and her mouth was open slightly and the expression on her face was one I will carry longer than the woman in the wire or the sound of bodies on rocks or anything else that happened on that hillside.

Horror. And shame. Not her shame — mine. She was looking at me the way you look at something you helped build and then watched become monstrous. She had argued against it and lost and stayed and watched because she wouldn't leave, and now she was seeing what the plan meant and what I meant — the fifteen-year-old who had borrowed a wolf-hunting technique and applied it to three hundred human beings and watched it work and felt something that was not horror.

She saw me notice. She turned away. Fast, deliberate, the way you turn from a car accident you've already seen too much of. She wiped her face with the back of her hand — quick, angry, the tears dealt with like an inconvenience — and she did not look at me again.

Something broke.

Not the analytical machinery — that had broken before. This was the thing underneath, the thing the machinery was built to protect: the fifteen-year-old boy from a trailer park who said "Happy Friday, bud" and meant it. That thing looked at Sienna's face and saw what it had become in her eyes and the seeing was the breaking.

The sound that came out of me was not a word. Something lower, something animal — the sound a body makes when the thing holding it together lets go all at once. Then it was crying. Sobbing. The kind that takes your legs because the diaphragm is convulsing too hard to keep the rest of you upright. I went down — not falling, crumbling, the way a building comes apart when the supports give, first to my knees, then forward onto my hands, and I was on the ground on a hillside in Arkansas making sounds like a wounded thing a few hundred yards from an enraged beast that continued to thrash itself to death, because that's what I was.

Dale reached for me. His hand — steady, always steady now, the hand that had held the wire and carved the fox and gripped my shoulder through every hard thing since Clarksville — reached for my arm.

I flinched away. Hard, involuntary, the recoil of something that couldn't be touched. Not because Dale was wrong but because touch meant comfort and comfort meant I was still human and I didn't know if I was still human and not-knowing was the thing that was making the sounds come out of me.

I looked at Dale. His face was — I saw it, the machinery records even when the rest of me is broken — the face of a man who recognized what he was seeing because he'd been there, on the floor, making the same sounds for different reasons. Recognition was worse than pity. Recognition meant he knew.

I ran.

I ran like a child runs — blind, graceless, crashing through the scrub oak and the dead leaves and the November brush on the hillside, away from the compound and the wire and the blood and the sounds and Sienna's face and Dale's hand and everything I had done and everything I had become. I ran into the woods because the woods were the only place that wasn't the roadblock and I needed to not be at the roadblock. The branches caught my face, my arms, the cuts from the wire opening again, and I didn't care. I ran until my legs gave out and then I crawled and when I couldn't crawl I stopped and I was somewhere in the Ozark woods, on the ground, alone, and the sounds were still coming out of me and I couldn't make them stop.

---

Sienna found me.

I don't know how long it took — minutes, an hour, the time was broken along with everything else. I heard her before I saw her — the careful footsteps, the brush moving, the sound of someone tracking something through woods they didn't know. She was fast. She'd always been fast. The athlete's instinct for pursuit, repurposed.

She didn't say anything. She sat down on the ground next to me — the cold ground, the dead leaves, the November dirt — and she didn't touch me and she didn't speak and she didn't try to fix it. She just sat. The way Dale had sat with me after dinner on other nights. The way you sit with something that is broken and that you can't repair and that you refuse to leave.

I don't know what happened in those hours. I know the sounds stopped eventually. I know the light changed — the afternoon moving toward evening, the shadows lengthening, the temperature dropping. I know she stayed. I know that at some point my breathing slowed and the convulsions stopped and I was just lying on the ground in the woods with my face in the leaves and my hands bleeding and the girl who had looked at me with horror sitting beside me in silence, and the silence was not the silence of judgment. It was the silence of someone who had decided that being there was enough, even if being there meant sitting next to the thing she'd seen on the hillside.

That is all I will ever say about this.  What happened is not for a journal or a story to be told, there was no lesson to learn. Those hours belong to nobody, I wish I could forget them myself.

We walked back at dusk. I don't remember the walk. I remember her hand on my elbow — once, brief, guiding me around a root — and I remember the group's faces when we emerged from the tree line. Marcus's face. Dale's face. Jim's face. I did not look at any of them. I could not look at anyone. The machinery was not running. The analytical brain was offline. Whatever remained was something older and simpler — a body that could walk and a pair of eyes that could see and a mouth that would not open.

I did not speak. Not that evening, not that night. They built a fire and I sat apart from it. Someone brought me water and I didn't drink it. Someone brought me food and I didn't eat it. Caleb brought me the wooden beagle and put it in my lap and went back to Marcus without a word and the beagle sat there on my thigh, small and wooden and carved by steady hands, and I did not pick it up and I did not put it down.

They let me be. There was nothing else to do.

---

The next morning I was functional. Not repaired — functional. The machinery had restarted in the night, the way a generator restarts when the fuel line clears. I ate. I drank. I packed. I walked.

Nobody mentioned it. Nobody asked. The silence around what had happened on the hillside was complete and permanent — a thing witnessed that did not need words because the words would have been smaller than the thing. Sienna walked near me but not beside me. She did not bring it up. She would never bring it up. We would never talk about it.

Some things survive by being buried. This was one of them.

The group walked south through a scene from hell.

Nobody spoke.

The road was covered in blood. The asphalt was submerged under a dark, thickening layer that soaked through our shoes in the first step and didn't stop. I felt the warmth of it through my soles, through my socks — a wet, heavy warmth that was nothing like water or mud. It was only what it was. The shopping cart wheels cut tracks through it, thin lines of exposed asphalt that filled in behind us.

Viscera hung from the razor wire at head height. Intestines draped across the concertina coils, loops of tissue caught on the blades, stretched by gravity into shapes that the body was never meant to make outside of it. Strips of skin. Muscle. Things that didn't have names outside a medical textbook and that I was seeing in the open air, in the morning light, strung on military wire like offerings. The smell was the smell of the compound compressed into a space we were now walking through — blood and meat and shit and something else, something biological, the chemical signature of hundreds of bodies opened at once, a smell that coated the inside of the throat and stayed there.

Maria vomited into the drainage ditch. Dale's face was white but his hands were steady, and he put one of those steady hands on Maria's back and held her hair and waited.

I saw her near the south funnel. A Turned woman, caught in the wire. Still alive. No longer frenzied — the frenzy had passed, the density had dropped below threshold, the phase transition had reversed. She was just there. Tangled in the concertina at the waist and the arms, the razor blades embedded in her clothes and her skin, dozens of points of entry. She was bleeding — slowly now, the frenzy's violence spent, the cuts seeping instead of flowing. She looked at nothing. The organism was still running behind her eyes but the body it was running was too damaged to move. She breathed. The breathing was the only motion. The wire rose and fell with her chest, the blades shifting in the wounds with each breath, and she didn't react to the cutting because the organism didn't process pain the way a person would.

I passed her. I didn't look away. I looked at her the way I looked at everything: directly, completely, recording. Someone's wife. Someone's mother. Someone who had been a person before the organism made her part of a collective, and who was now tangled in razor wire because a fifteen-year-old had borrowed a hunting technique from people who lived in a place where wolves were the problem.

Caleb was on Marcus's back, face buried in Marcus's shoulder. Marcus was talking to him — a low, steady murmur about nothing, about truck stops, about what kind of ice cream was best, keeping the boy's world small and warm while he picked the path through the wire and the blood, keeping Caleb's face turned away from the worst of it, which was all of it.

Jim walked last. He walked through the blood with his head bowed and his lips moving and he was praying — for the dead, for the Turned, for the people who had been people before they were meat on wire. I watched him and I understood that Jim's prayer and my math had arrived at the same event from different directions, and that the event was the same regardless of which road you took to get there, and that the difference between us was not in the outcome but in what we carried afterward.

Jim would carry the prayer. I would carry the woman in the wire.

That night, camped in a pulloff a mile south of the roadblock, I wrote by flashlight. The fire was too far from where I was sitting and I was sitting apart because I didn't want to be near people and I didn't want to be alone and...damn. I'd washed the blood off my shoes in a creek but the smell was still there — in my clothes, in my hair, in the skin of my hands where the wire had cut me. The cuts on my palms were shallow but they stung and I didn't bandage them because the stinging felt correct.

This was the first thing I'd written since the hillside. The machinery had been offline for most of a day — the breakdown, the woods, the silence, the walk through the blood. Now it was back, and the first thing the machinery did with its restored capacity was try to process what had happened by writing it down, because that's what the machinery does, because I am the machinery and the machinery is me and the writing is the only tool I have that works on the things that break me.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #15:**

*We killed approximately three hundred people yesterday. I say "approximately" because I lost count when the second wave came out of the woods. I say "people" because I don't know what else to call them. I say "we" because it was my idea.*

*I planned for a hundred and thirty. I planned it with math and with a hunting technique I'd read about on Wikipedia at two in the morning three years ago when I should have been sleeping. The Eskimo wolf knife. I taught myself how Eskimo hunters kill wolves and I applied it to human beings and the application worked and then kept working after I wanted it to stop.

*After the second wave I looked at Sienna and she was looking at me and the thing in her face was — I am not going to write what it was. I know what it was.

*I broke. I should record that. The analytical machinery failed and what came out was not data. Sienna came after me and we sat in the dirt for hours and that is all you need to know.

*Jim wouldn't look at me during dinner. Marcus gave me a cup of water and said "drink this" the way you talk to someone in shock, because I was.*

*Here is what I know: we are all alive, including Caleb, including Ruth, and we are one day closer to the university.*

*Here is what I don't know: whether that math justifies what we did.*

*Here is what I'm afraid of: that I'll get used to it.*

*Here is what I'm more afraid of: that I need to.* because clearly, I can't.

*Here is what I can't write and am writing anyway: part of me wanted it. The other thing. The thing with edges that I've been carrying since Clarksville. It wanted the roadblock. It wanted the wire to hold and the frenzy to build and the organism to feel, for once, what it felt like to be on the receiving end. The math provided the justification. The anger provided the willingness. And I don't know which one made the decision because they arrived at the same answer at the same time and the answer was: do it.*

*I told Jim "they were people" and heard the detachment in my own voice and the detachment was real but it was also a performance — the analytical boy performing analysis while the angry boy watched the wire cut and felt something that was not horror. And then the performance collapsed and I was on the ground making sounds that were not analysis.

*The worst part is the scale. I did the math for a hundred and thirty and the world sent three hundred and the wolf knife doesn't have an off switch. I can't hide behind precision when the result was the opposite of precise. I can't say "I calculated the optimal outcome" when the outcome was a quarter-mile of highway covered in blood deep enough to soak through shoes. The math was a frame I built and the world broke the frame and the breaking is the thing I can't reconcile: that my best analysis, my most careful plan, produced something I couldn't control.*

*Dale sat with me for an hour after dinner. He didn't say anything. He carved the fox. His hands were steady — the withdrawal broken days ago on the trail — and the fox was beautiful and I thought about how the damage and the craft come from the same place and you don't get one without the other. Dale's hands had shaken for days and now they didn't and the fox was proof that the other side of suffering is precision.*

*Tomorrow we walk. The highway stretches south toward Fayetteville — twenty miles, maybe twenty-five. More Turned as we get closer to the city. More decisions. I'll have a plan because that's what I do now. I make plans that involve other people dying so that my people can live, and I write them in a notebook and I execute them from hillsides and I carry the results in my chest like stones and the stones are getting heavier and I'm fifteen and I don't know how many more I can carry before the weight of them changes me into something I don't recognize.*

*Sienna asked me if I was okay. I said yes. She said "Liar." She was right. She's always right about the things I don't say.*

---

The next day we found the town.

It wasn't much — a bend in the highway where a gas station, a general store, and a barbecue restaurant clustered around an intersection like survivors huddling for warmth. The kind of place that had survived on Pig Trail tourists: bikers on weekend rides, families stopping for pulled pork and sweet tea, college kids from Fayetteville driving up to see the fall leaves. A sign out front of the restaurant said WORLD FAMOUS SMOKED RIBS. The world that had made them famous was gone.

Someone had fortified the gas station. Plywood over the windows, reinforced with sheet metal from the restaurant's roof. A pickup truck parked sideways across the entrance, blocking the lot. Barbed wire — actual barbed wire, probably from a farm supply — strung between the gas pumps. And on the roof, behind a low wall of sandbags, a man with a deer rifle watching us approach.

"That's far enough," he called. We were fifty yards out. The shopping carts rattled to a stop.

Marcus raised both hands. "We're passing through. Heading south."

"Nobody passes through. You go around."

"There's no around. The highway is the road."

A pause. The man on the roof consulted someone below — I could hear voices, muffled, the acoustics of people arguing inside a metal-and-plywood box. Then a woman emerged from behind the truck barricade. Mid-forties, sunburned, a shotgun held at port arms with the casual competence of someone who'd grown up with guns.

"How many?" she asked.

"Eight. One child, one elderly."

She looked at us — really looked, the way you assess livestock or weather. Counting heads, reading posture, calculating threat. Her eyes lingered on Marcus's crossbow, on the hatchets at Dale's and Sienna's hips.

"You're armed."

"Lightly. We're not looking for trouble."

"Nobody's looking for trouble. Trouble shows up anyway." She lowered the shotgun half an inch. "What do you have to trade?"

This was Marcus's territory — the negotiation, the reading of a room. He stepped forward, slow, hands visible. "Medication. Blood pressure meds, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories. Some painkillers — prescription, from a pharmacy."

Interest flickered across her face. Medication was currency now — more valuable than food, more valuable than ammunition, because you couldn't grow it or reload it or find it in the woods. When the pharmacies were empty, the medication was gone.

"What do you want?"

"Food. Canned goods, dried meat, whatever you can spare. We're three days from Fayetteville."

They let us approach. Not inside — we traded through the barricade, items passed over the hood of the pickup truck. Maria handled the inventory, counting pills, portioning carefully, keeping enough of Ruth's atenolol for the remaining days while trading the surplus antibiotics and ibuprofen she'd stockpiled from the church's first-aid supplies. In exchange: twelve cans of beans, a bag of rice, a sleeve of beef jerky, and a gallon jug of water.

There were nine of them inside the gas station. I could see them through the gap in the plywood — faces in the dim interior, watching us the way the Turned watched from a distance, with that guarded, calculating patience. A teenager, roughly my age, stared at me from behind the counter. He had the look — the hollowed-out, too-old look that I recognized because I saw it in every reflective surface. We were the same age and we were both ancient.

I recognized the pattern. The Lyles' house. The fortified position, the barricade, the perimeter defense. The belief that if you built the walls high enough, the world would stay outside.

"How long have you been here?" I asked the woman.

"Since the beginning. Three weeks."

"How many were you when you started?"

She didn't answer, which was its own answer. More than nine. Maybe fifteen, maybe twenty. The attrition of a static position — the Turned pressing in, the supplies dwindling, the perimeter shrinking.

"You should move," I said. The words came out before the social calculus could stop them. "South. Fayetteville. We've heard there's a research group at the university — someone working on the frequency."

"We've heard a lot of things."

"The static defense doesn't hold. I've seen it. The Turned concentrate around fixed positions — the noise, the lights, the human smell. The longer you stay, the more of them gather. The density builds until it tips into frenzy and the frenzy destroys whatever you've built."

The woman looked at me. The way adults look at children who say things children shouldn't know. "How old are you?"

"Fifteen."

"And you're an expert on survival strategy."

"I'm an expert on what I've observed. And I've observed that everyone who fortifies dies. Everyone who moves survives. The math isn't complicated."

She didn't respond. Behind her, through the gap in the plywood, the teenager was still watching me. He'd heard. Whether he believed was a different question.

We left. Shopping carts loaded with the traded food, wheels rattling on the asphalt, the gas station shrinking behind us. Marcus walked beside me.

"You tried," he said.

"They won't move."

"No."

"They'll die there."

"Probably." Marcus adjusted the crossbow on his shoulder. "You can't save people who don't want to be saved. That's not a failure. That's a boundary."

A quarter mile past the gas station, a farmhouse sat back from the highway behind a collapsing fence. The house was empty — door open, curtains moving in the wind. But behind it, in a tilted coop with chicken wire peeling off the frame, something was alive and making sounds about it.

Three hens. Brown, fat, furious. Surviving on gravel and weeds and whatever insects had the misfortune of crossing their path. They'd outlasted the apocalypse through the only strategy chickens know: being too dumb and too angry to die.

Caleb heard them before anyone else. His head came up from Marcus's shoulder — he'd been riding in the cart, legs dangling — and his face did something I hadn't seen since before the roadblock. Hope. The specific, dangerous hope of a seven-year-old who has lost something and is seeing it returned in a different shape.

"Can we —"

"No," Marcus said.

"They'll die here."

"They've been alive for six weeks without us."

Maria was already lining a shopping cart with a towel. She looked at Marcus. Marcus looked at the sky. The hens went into the cart. They did not go quietly. They went with the concentrated outrage of animals being handled by strangers, flapping and squawking and producing a volume of sound wildly disproportionate to their size.

"If that bird makes one sound past dark," Marcus said, "it's nuggets."

Caleb, from the cart, deadly serious: "Her name is Steggy Two."

The chickens squawked at every crack in the asphalt, every pebble, every shift in the cart's trajectory. They squawked at the wind. They squawked at each other. They squawked at the concept of forward motion. We pushed them south toward Fayetteville in a shopping cart, three furious hens and a seven-year-old boy who was already talking to them in the low, earnest voice he used for Dale's wooden animals, and for thirty minutes the apocalypse was a grocery run that had gone sideways, and I almost forgot what the highway behind us looked like.

I looked back once. The man on the roof was watching us go. The rifle was still in his hands. The barbed wire glinted in the afternoon sun. Nine people in a gas station, waiting for the world to come to them.

The world would come.


# Chapter 22: Mom

Day 39. The highway was flat and empty and there was nothing to think about except the things I'd been refusing to think about for sixteen days.

The mountains were behind us. The trail was behind us. The roadblock was behind us — the razor wire and the three hundred people I'd killed by borrowing a wolf-hunting technique. The fortified group was behind us — nine people in a gas station who wouldn't leave. All of it was behind us and we'd carry it for the rest of our lives.

Highway 71 stretched south in a straight line, flat, featureless, the kind of road that gives the mind nothing to hold onto. No switchbacks. No creek crossings. No rocks to navigate or hills to climb. Just asphalt and sky and the rattle of shopping cart wheels and a steady rhythm of walking that required no thought. When the machinery has nothing to process, it idles. When it idles, the things it's been holding back seep through.

I was tired. Not the productive tiredness of trail days. This was cumulative — built in layers like sediment: weeks of insufficient food on top of blisters that had healed and re-opened and healed again on top of a month of sleeping on the ground on top of three hundred people shredded on razor wire on top of everything else. Everything else being: a woman in blue scrubs in a hospital parking lot in Clarksville, standing with bare feet and nothing behind her eyes. My mother. I'd opened that sealed envelope in the truck with Marcus and had been carrying it open ever since — visible, unbearable, following me through sixty miles of trail and thirty miles of highway like a weight heavier than the pack.

The analytical machinery had been carrying it — taking the unbearable thing and converting it into data, filing it, processing it into something manageable. Running nonstop since Clarksville. Since I saw her face and Marcus kept driving and I said "I see her" and the words were data and the container held.

The container held through the first days on the trail, when the physical suffering was new enough to occupy the machinery's full capacity. Through the creek crossings and the gear discarding and the nightly inventory of blisters and the obsessive management of socks and the slow adaptation of a body that had never been asked to do anything like this. Through Dale's withdrawal peaking and breaking. Through the Rock House Shelter, where we'd slept dry and warm and I'd almost felt something like peace. Through the stray Turned hunter in the woods, nocking his invisible arrow, who reminded me that the organism took everyone — hunters and nurses, fathers and mothers, people who had been people. Through the roadblock, where I became the kind of person who engineers a wolf knife out of razor wire and walks through the results. Through the gas station, where I watched myself fail to save people for the third time and understood that the pattern would repeat forever.

The container held because the machinery was running. And on Day 39, on a flat stretch of highway with nothing to think about, the machinery stopped.

Not dramatically. Just a quiet failure, like a generator running out of fuel. One moment I was walking and processing and carrying the weight in its compartment. The next moment the compartment was open and the weight was everywhere — in my legs, in my lungs, in the flat grey light of a November afternoon, in the sound of my own breathing, in the empty highway that stretched in both directions like a sentence with no end.

I stopped on the highway. The group moved on for a few steps. Sienna noticed first — she always noticed first.

I was standing on the asphalt and I was not moving because there was nowhere to move to. Every direction was away from her. The distance that mattered was temporal, irreversible — between a kitchen where she poured coffee and a parking lot where she stood with bare feet. No amount of walking would close it.

"Nate," Sienna said.

I looked at her. She was tired — they all were, the highway's flatness and monotony grinding something that switchbacks and creek crossings at least distracted you from. She looked at me and she saw it. She always saw it.

I didn't say anything. The highway said it for me — stretching in both directions, flat and empty and indifferent, and the emptiness was the truest thing about the world.

Sienna took my hand.

She had never done this before. In five weeks of proximity and argument and whatever we were becoming, she had touched my elbow twice and my arm once, each time brief and functional. This was different. Her fingers between my fingers. Her grip firm and warm. She was holding me in the world by the specific physical fact of her hand.

We stood there. On the highway. Five minutes or five hours.

Then we walked on. Because walking was the only verb left.

---

I didn't write in the journal that night. I sat by the fire at the roadside camp and said nothing and ate nothing and everyone left me alone because they understood. Caleb brought me the wooden beagle and put it in my lap without a word and went back to Marcus's side.

Two days later I opened the notebook.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #16:**

*She would have been scared. At the end. She would have been so scared.*

---

That night I dreamed she was fine.

The real one. The kitchen in the trailer, 6 PM on a Thursday, still in her scrubs because she'd worked a double and hadn't changed. Making coffee she shouldn't have been drinking that late. The radio on the counter playing something country and terrible that she loved. The particular way she leaned her hip against the counter while the pot brewed — the posture of a woman who had been on her feet for sixteen hours and was going to be on them for eight more because I had a dentist appointment in the morning and she wanted to make sure I ate breakfast before we left.

"Happy Friday, bud," she said.

And it was right. It was *her* — the voice, the cadence, the way the words carried the weight of a person who said them every week because the saying was a ritual and the ritual was love and the love was the thing she'd built our whole small life around. It was the realest thing I'd dreamed since the world ended. Not the nightmare versions — not the too-wide smile, not the Knock-voice bleeding through — just my mother, in our kitchen, saying the thing she always said.

I said, "It's Thursday, Mom."

"Close enough," she said, and smiled, and poured two cups, and the dream was so ordinary and so perfect that I would have lived in it forever.

Then I was outside.

Just outside, in the parking lot in Clarksville, at night, and the kitchen window was a hospital window three stories up and she was standing behind the glass. Still in scrubs. Still holding the coffee. But her face was wrong — smooth, blank, the expression I'd seen on two hundred Turned and had seen on her, across the parking lot, the day Marcus kept driving. Her mouth moved. No sound through the glass. She put her hand against the window, palm flat, fingers spread.

I put my hand against the glass. I couldn't not. The glass was warm.

I woke walking.

I was ten feet from my sleeping bag, moving past the dying campfire toward the highway, and my heart was at 118 and I didn't know where I was or when I was or whether the glass had been real. My hand was still raised, palm out, reaching for a window that wasn't there.

I didn't go back to the sleeping bag. The dream was still in the air — the *good* part, the kitchen and the coffee and her voice — and going back to sleep meant either returning to it or losing it and I couldn't survive either one.

I took the binoculars and walked. Back up the highway. Back the way we'd come. Back toward Clarksville.

---


# Chapter 23: Nate Walks

*Third-person interstitial.*

---

Marcus woke her at 3 AM.

He was crouched beside her sleeping bag, one hand on her shoulder, the other holding the crossbow loosely at his side. His face was the one he wore when he was worried and didn't want anyone to know — jaw set, eyes careful.

"Nate's walking," he said. Quiet. Resigned.

Sienna sat up. "Walking where?"

"North. Back up the highway. I watched him go twenty minutes ago." Marcus had been on watch — seated on the retaining wall at the edge of the pulloff, crossbow across his knees, scanning the dark highway in both directions the way he'd done every night since Clarksville. He'd seen Nate rise from the sleeping bag, take the binoculars, and walk past the fire without looking back. "I let him go. He needed — I don't know what he needed. But he's been gone too long and he's heading the wrong direction."

They were camped in a highway pulloff — a wide gravel shoulder where truckers used to park, the shopping carts pulled to the side, sleeping bags laid out on pads in the shelter of a concrete retaining wall. The fire had burned down to coals that pulsed orange when the wind moved through. The group was scattered along the pulloff, the shapes of sleeping bodies barely visible in the dark. The air smelled like asphalt and woodsmoke and the particular cold of a November night on exposed highway.

Sienna pulled on her shoes, took the blood pressure cuff — habit, the cuff went everywhere now, pink and absurd and essential — and moved past the fire. Marcus stayed on watch. That was the arrangement they didn't need to discuss: someone goes after Nate, someone stays with the group. Marcus was the guard. Sienna was the one Nate might actually stop for.

The night was cold. November on Highway 71, the air sharp enough to taste, the stars dense above the open road. She listened. Wind. The distant sound of something — an animal, or not — moving in the scrub beyond the shoulder. The sounds of an empty highway that she was learning to distinguish from the other sounds — the ones that meant something was wrong.

She heard footsteps. North. On the highway.

She found him a quarter mile from camp. He was just walking. In the dark, without a flashlight, without a plan, back up the highway the way they'd come. Back toward Clarksville. Back toward the hospital parking lot where he'd seen her from the truck, the woman in blue scrubs, the day Marcus kept driving.

She caught up to him. His face was blank in the starlight — not the analytical blankness he wore like armor. This was empty. The face of a person who had run out of the thing that held them together.

"Nate," she said.

He didn't stop. Didn't acknowledge her. Kept walking.

She walked alongside him. She didn't touch him, didn't talk, didn't try to block his path. She matched his pace and stayed a foot to his left and let the silence be the thing between them. She'd learned this from watching him — the patient observation, the refusal to intervene until you understood what you were intervening in. He'd taught her more about stillness than he'd ever know.

They walked for five minutes. The highway was dark. The mountains on either side were dark. Somewhere to the north, thirty miles of highway and sixty miles of trail and twenty miles of road away, was the hospital parking lot and the woman in blue scrubs.

"Nate, she's not there."

He kept walking. Then he said: "I know."

His voice was flat. Two words, no inflection. He understood with absolute clarity that the thing he was walking toward was not the thing he needed and he could not stop walking toward it because the need was deeper than understanding, deeper than the machinery that had kept him alive for five weeks, deeper than the notebook and the lessons and the framework. The need was the child who wanted his mother, and the child did not care about epinephrine thresholds or density calculations.

Sienna had watched Nate hold his composure through everything. The knock on the door. The septic tank. The Lyles burning. She had watched him see his mother's face in a parking lot and keep walking. She had watched him absorb horror after horror and convert each one into data, each trauma into a journal entry, each loss into a lesson. She had admired it and been frightened by it — the cold engine running behind the eyes of a fifteen-year-old who should have been doing homework.

She understood now that the engine had limits. The processing was not the same as the feeling, and the feelings he hadn't felt were still in there, pressing against the walls of the container he'd built, and the container had cracked — from the slow grinding of weeks, the hunger and the blisters and three hundred dead people in razor wire and everything the notebook couldn't carry — and the crack was beyond repair.

She started talking. To be present. To fill the dark with something that wasn't silence.

"My parents left on Friday night," she said. "Around eight. They were going to get Jaylen from my grandmother's in Oklahoma City. My dad said they'd be back by midnight. My mom kissed me on the forehead and said 'Lock the door.'" She paused. "I locked the door. That's the last thing I did for them. I locked the door."

Nate's pace slowed. Not much. A fraction.

"I decided three weeks ago that they're alive. I have no evidence. The math doesn't support it. But the alternative is a thought I can't afford to have. If I let myself think they're dead — or turned — or standing in a parking lot somewhere in Oklahoma with blank faces and bare feet — then I can't function. I can't run. I can't carry Caleb. I can't be the person this group needs me to be. So I decided they're alive and I carry that decision like a lie I tell myself every morning and I know it's probably a lie and I carry it anyway because the lie is lighter than the truth and I need my arms free."

Nate stopped walking.

His legs gave out. He sat down on the highway — just folded, the way a structure folds when the load-bearing element fails — and he was on the dirt in the dark and his hands were over his face and he was crying.

Ugly and loud and completely uncontrolled — the sound of a fifteen-year-old boy who had held everything together for five weeks through intelligence and discipline and the ruthless conversion of grief into strategy, and who had run out. The raw sound of loss on an empty highway in the dark, in a world where raw sound was the thing that killed you.

Sienna dropped to her knees beside him. She put her hand over his mouth. Hard — this was survival, the same instinct that had made Nate bite his own hand on the night of the knock.

"Quiet," she said. "Quiet. I know. But quiet."

He couldn't stop. The sound came through her fingers — muffled, broken, the sound of something that had been sealed too long and was venting. She pressed harder. She put her other arm around him — the first time she'd held him, the first full-body contact between them, and it was the most intimate thing either of them had experienced because intimacy, in this world, was keeping someone alive when they wanted to die.

"I know," she whispered. "I know. But quiet. Please. Quiet."

The crying subsided. The body runs out before the grief does. He sat on the asphalt with Sienna's hand over his mouth and Sienna's arm around him and he shook and didn't make a sound and the stars were cold above them and the highway was dark in both directions.

Marcus found them twenty minutes later. He'd woken, noticed the empty sleeping bags, followed the highway. He stood over them for a moment — two kids on the asphalt, one holding the other — and he didn't ask what happened.

He picked Nate up. Nate was not small, and Marcus was tired. He performed the effort without comment because Marcus understood that some things needed to be done.

He carried Nate back to camp. Sienna walked beside them, her hand on Nate's arm, maintaining contact. Jim was awake by the fire, feeding it back to life. He said nothing. He put a blanket around Nate's shoulders and guided him onto his sleeping pad and Nate lay down and closed his eyes and Jim sat beside him for the rest of the night, one hand on his shoulder, not praying — or maybe praying, the line between presence and prayer being, as Jim would say, nonexistent.

Nobody discussed it in the morning.

# Chapter 24: What Dale Learned

I came back slowly. From a state where you stop being the person who processes and become the person who is processed. I'd been there for two days and I don't remember much of it except Sienna's hand and Jim's shoulder and Marcus carrying me and Caleb putting the beagle in my lap and the weight of a small carved dog in my hands being the most real thing in the world.

On the morning of Day 41 I woke up and the analytical machinery was back online. Not fully — the crack was still there, like a broken bone that's been set but not healed. But the machinery was running. I could think. I could observe. I could plan.

But first there was the morning, and the morning was slow. Ruth made me tea from a packet she'd been hoarding — chamomile, the paper tag still attached, the string hanging over the side of a dented camp cup. She didn't say anything while she made it. She didn't say anything when she handed it to me. She sat on a log across from mine and read her romance novel and the only sound was pages turning and the tea cooling and the specific silence of a person who is keeping you company without requiring you to be anything.

Jim came through with Caleb. Caleb sat beside me and leaned against my arm and showed me a rock he'd found — quartz, milky, with a vein of something glittery running through it. "Marcus says it's worth a million dollars," he said. "He's lying but I'm keeping it." Then he climbed up and went to find more rocks, and the whole interaction lasted forty-five seconds and cost nothing and was worth everything.

What Caleb doesn't know is that he cries in his sleep. Every night. Small, hitching sounds, the kind a child makes when the crying has gone on so long the body has automated it. He never remembers in the morning. Jim holds him through it, one hand on Caleb's back, not waking him, because waking him would mean explaining and explaining would mean making it real and the mercy, for now, is that Caleb's grief lives only in his sleep where he can't see it. None of us mention it. We lie in our sleeping bags and listen to a seven-year-old cry for parents he hasn't talked about since Week Two and we say nothing because saying something would break the one protection he has left.

These are the moments that don't make the journal entries. The tea. The rock. The sound of Ruth turning pages. They happened between the crises the way grass grows between stones. I want you to know about them because the version of this story that only contains fear and strategy and running is not the true version. The true version has chamomile tea in it. The true version has a seven-year-old showing you a rock.

Dale was sitting across from me at the fire, carving. The turtle was nearly finished — the hexagonal plates of the shell emerging with clean, precise strokes. His hands were steady. They'd been steady for days now, the withdrawal broken back around Day 8 on the trail, but I was only now seeing it properly because I'd been inside my own weather system and had stopped noticing anything outside it.

He looked up and caught me watching his hands.

"You're back," he said. Not a question.

"I'm back."

He set down the knife. "Good. Because I want to teach you something. All of you. Not HALT — that was the basics. This is the advanced course."

---

Marcus was already packing. Rolling tarps, cinching straps, checking the shopping cart wheels. "Teach while we walk," he said. "Daylight's burning."

So Dale taught while we walked.

We broke camp and continued south on the highway, the terrain opening as the mountains fell behind us. The first lesson came on the first grade — not steep, but enough that my breathing deepened and I felt the old pattern stirring, the anger looking for something to push against.

"Radical acceptance," Dale said, walking beside me, pushing a shopping cart over cracked asphalt. "The name is terrible. It sounds like a bumper sticker. But it's the most useful thing I ever learned." He was breathing hard — the grade — but his voice was steady. "Here's what it means. The situation is what it is. Your feelings about the situation are not the situation. You can feel like this hill is going to kill you and still be walking up it. The feeling is weather. The hill is geography. You navigate the geography. You endure the weather."

Ruth, from behind us: "That's remarkably coherent for someone who learned it in a rehabilitation clinic."

"Rehab was the most educational experience of my life. More than high school. More than the army. Six years of active addiction was its own education, but the curriculum was pain and the degree was worthless." He almost smiled. "In rehab I learned that the brain lies. Not maliciously — the brain lies the way a GPS lies when the map is outdated. It gives you directions based on old data. 'Turn left to feel better.' 'Use this substance to stop the pain.' 'Run from the thing that scares you.' The directions were correct in the old world. In this world, the directions will kill you."

He went quiet on the steeper pitch — nobody talks on the steep parts — and picked it up on the next flat stretch.

"Urge surfing. When the urge comes — the craving, the fear, the panic — you don't fight it. You ride it. You notice it: 'My heart rate is up. My hands are sweating. My brain is telling me to run.' Like a wave. The wave is real. The wave has power. And the wave passes. Every wave passes. You just have to not drown, and not drowning is mostly about not panicking."

Marcus, pushing his cart over a pothole: "That sounds like something I should have heard twenty years ago."

"It sounds like something everyone should hear. The recovery community figured out the mechanics of emotional regulation before the neuroscientists did. We had to — our lives depended on it. And now everyone's life depends on it and the irony is —" He glanced at his hands on the cart handle. Steady. "The irony is that the thing that destroyed me is the thing that trained me. Six years of addiction gave me the problem. Twelve years of recovery gave me the skills. And the skills are the exact skills you need to survive a pathogen that feeds on fear."

We stopped for water at a pull-off where the highway widened. Caleb sat on the guardrail, arranging his wooden animals in a line — beagle, cardinal, fox, turtle — and the line looked like a parade going somewhere hopeful.

Dale sat on the edge of a shopping cart and looked at us.

"Rock bottom was just training," he said. "And every one of you — every person here who has ever been afraid, or addicted, or depressed, or anxious, or broken in whatever way your particular brain decided to break — has training you don't know you have. Your damage is your skillset. The thing that went wrong is the thing that prepared you. I know that sounds like a motivational poster. I know that. But I'm three weeks past my last dose of Suboxone and my hands are steady and I'm alive and the reason I'm alive is that my brain broke in exactly the right way at exactly the right time and I spent twelve years learning to manage the break."

Jim, sitting with Caleb on the guardrail: "Dale, that's the best sermon I've ever heard."

"It's not a sermon. Sermons have endings. This is a practice. You do it every day. Every five minutes, if you have to."

"That's also what faith is."

Dale looked at Jim. Two men who had spent their lives in folding chairs — one in church basements, one in meeting rooms — who had arrived at the same discipline from opposite directions. The practice was the same. The names were different.

"Yeah," Dale said. "I guess it is."

---

**JOURNAL ENTRY #17:**

*Dale's damage was his skillset. His words, not mine. But I've been turning them over the way he turns wood in his hands, and I think the principle extends further than he meant it.*

*My damage is my skillset too. But not the way I've been telling it.*

*I've been telling the story where I'm a fat kid who happened to be good at pattern recognition. The body is the limitation, the brain is the asset, and the gap between them is the joke — the running gag (emphasis on running, which I can't do) that gets me through the day. Everybody laughs. Nobody expects me to change.*

*Sienna told me to stop. She said I was building the case for my own powerlessness. She said the old world could afford comfortable lies and passive withdrawal and this world can't. She said that in the best case scenario, everything that goes wrong is my fault, because that means I can fix it.*

*I hated her for saying it. I hate her less now. I hate her less every day, which is a trajectory that points toward something I don't have a word for yet.*

*Here is what I'm trying to learn: the body is a starting point. I weigh less than I did on Day One — not much, but some, because five weeks of rationing and walking will do that. I carried twenty-five pounds up a mountain. I walked through a septic tank. I will walk through whatever comes next because I'm choosing to be that person, today, and tomorrow I'll choose again. The notebook is not a substitute for the walk. The walk is the thing.*

*I'm not going to stop being funny about it. The humor is mine. But I'm going to stop using it as a door I hide behind. Sienna opened that door. I'm walking through.*

---

After the stop, Dale walked near the front, pushing one of the shopping carts. His pace was steady — the walk of a man who had come through the worst of it and was standing on the other side. The road descended through the last of the switchbacks toward the broad plateau where Fayetteville sat. Maria walked behind him, and I noticed that she wasn't walking behind him to support him. He was setting the pace and she was following it. The dynamic between them had shifted from "managing the addict" to "walking with the man," and neither of them acknowledged it.

Marcus, walking beside me, said quietly: "He's tougher than he looks."

"He's tougher than anyone."

"Don't tell him that. He'll start thinking he's important and then he'll get lazy." A pause. "That's a joke. Truckers make those. They're bad."

"You've been making better ones."

"Don't tell me that either. I have a reputation."

We walked. The highway curved through the last of the hills. Through the trees I could see the terrain flattening ahead — the outskirts of something, the edge of a city, buildings and fields and the built-up sprawl of a college town.

"Fayetteville," Marcus said, reading a road sign. "Ten miles."

I nodded. Ten miles. The last stretch. But between us and the university — whatever was gathered on the outskirts of a city that had once held eighty thousand people. The Turned would be concentrated there. Drawn to the population center, the infrastructure, the gravitational pull of human settlement.

"Then we'll need everything Dale just taught us."

Marcus nodded. We walked on. The highway dropped toward the city and the sky widened above us and somewhere ahead, past whatever waited on the outskirts of Fayetteville, was the university and Dr. Moss and the sound of a frequency that kept the Turned at bay.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #18:**

*Dale is through the withdrawal. Steady hands. Steady voice. Four weeks past his last Suboxone and he's alive and functioning and the reason he's alive is twelve years of sitting in folding chairs and not doing the thing his brain told him to do.*

*He taught us radical acceptance. The situation is what it is. Your feelings about the situation are not the situation. This is the most useful sentence I've learned since "the mechanism is adrenaline," and it's more important because it applies to everything — not just the Turned, not just survival, but the grief and the fear and the fact that my mother is standing in a parking lot in Clarksville and I can't save her and the feeling of that is not the thing itself.*

*Fayetteville. Ten miles. Whatever's gathered on the outskirts of a city that held eighty thousand people.*

*I'm scared. My resting heart rate is 72. The gap is smaller than it used to be. I'm using Dale's techniques — noticing the fear, not fighting it, not riding it, just noticing. The fear is weather. The city is geography. I navigate the geography.*

*I navigate the geography.*


# Chapter 25: The Herd

From the last rise on Highway 71, where the road crested a hill and the landscape opened into the broad plateau south of Fayetteville, I looked through the binoculars and saw a forest that hadn't existed six weeks ago.

The outskirts of the city spread below us — a mile of open terrain, fields and subdivisions and strip malls and the wide, flat infrastructure of a college town's southern approach. Gas stations. A Dollar General. A church with a full parking lot — the cars still there, the congregation not. And beyond all of it, barely visible through the November haze, the campus. Red brick. Limestone. The glass front of the science building catching the late-afternoon sun.

Between us and the campus: a thousand standing figures. But they were not standing the way the Turned I'd observed before had stood — swaying, drifting, the aimless patrol of the organism's default mode. These were motionless. Utterly, absolutely still. A field of human-shaped trees rooted in the earth of a college town's floodplain.

I adjusted the focus. The binoculars brought them close enough to see the details, and the details were wrong in a way that made the back of my skull go cold.

They were nude. All of them — or nearly all. The greening I'd been tracking since Pembrook had progressed into something else entirely. Their skin was a dark greyish-green, the color of lichen on wet stone, and they faced the sun with the same uniform orientation — south-southeast, every face angled toward the light like a thousand solar panels on a thousand organic masts. But it was their feet that stopped me. Their feet were not on the ground. They were *in* it. Sunk two or three inches into the soil, the earth dark and disturbed around their ankles where it had been broken and resealed, and from their legs — from the calves, the shins, the place where skin met soil — dark structures grew. Vine-like. Root-like. Ropy tendrils the color of old blood that ran along the surface of the ground, connecting one figure to the next, branching and joining, a visible network that linked body to body across the field in an intricate web. A colony. A root system with human-shaped trunks.

I tracked the roots. They were everywhere — threading through the grass, crossing sidewalks, climbing over curbs. Where soil was exposed, the network was dense, the roots thick and intertwined, the rooted Turned packed close together in clusters of ten, twenty, fifty, their vine connections so interwoven that the ground between them was more root than earth. Where pavement interrupted — roads, parking lots, the Dollar General's asphalt — the roots thinned or stopped, unable to penetrate, and the rooted Turned were absent. The pavement was a barrier. The organism couldn't root through concrete.

I lowered the binoculars. My hands were not shaking.

"What is it?" Sienna asked. She was beside me on the hilltop, the whole group arrayed along the shoulder of the highway, looking down at the approach the way you'd look down at the surface of another planet.

"They're not moving," I said. "Most of them. They're — rooted. Standing in the soil. Connected to each other by some kind of vine or root structure. Like they've become plants."

I handed her the binoculars. She looked for a long time. When she lowered them, her face had the expression of someone who has just been told a new rule of physics.

Marcus took the binoculars next. Then Dale. Then Jim. They passed them down the line like communion, each person looking at the valley and seeing the same impossible thing: a landscape full of people who had stopped being people and started being something that didn't have a name yet.

"How many?" Sienna asked.

"A thousand. Maybe more." I took the binoculars back and scanned again, counting categories this time. The analytical machinery, engaged. "But they're not all the same. The rooted ones — the ones in the ground — that's most of them. Maybe ninety percent. They're completely still. They don't react to anything I can see."

I panned. "There are others. Maybe eight percent — they're the ones we've seen before. Drifters. Passive. They move through the rooted like — like attendants. Wandering between them. Same behavior as the Turned on the trail, the aimless patrol."

I panned again and found the third type.

"And there are a few — two percent, maybe less — that move differently. Faster. Directed. They're carrying things."

"Carrying what?" Marcus said.

I watched one through the binoculars. It moved with purpose through the rows of rooted, navigating the root network on the ground with the ease of familiarity. It was carrying something in its arms — a shape I couldn't identify at this distance. Organic. Dark. It walked to a cluster of rooted and set the thing down at their feet, placing it among the roots with a deliberate care that looked almost ceremonial.

"Food," I said. "They're bringing food to the rooted ones. Placing it at their feet. Like — " I searched for the word. "Like an offering."

Silence. Below us, the forest of human trees stood in the sun. The attendants drifted. The hunters carried their offerings.

Marcus said: "The university is down there. Straight through. Maybe two miles."

"Through them."

"Through them."

Ruth, leaning on her walking stick: "Is there another way in?"

"We could loop east, try to come in from the other side. But the Turned ring the city — they're drawn to the population center. Every approach looks like this." Marcus paused. "Looping adds a day. Maybe two."

"Ruth's atenolol runs out tomorrow," Maria said. No inflection. Just math.

I looked at the valley again. The clothing progression I'd been tracking since Week One terminated here. The undressing hadn't been random. It had been preparation. The organism had been stripping its hosts for weeks, exposing the skin to the sun, driving the photosynthetic adaptation, and all of it had been building toward this: the rooting. The final stage. Mobile host becomes sessile host. Animal becomes plant. The clothing came off because roots don't wear shirts.

The superintelligence I'd sensed in the herd now had a physical explanation. The root network. The vine-like structures connecting body to body through the soil. They were *wired together.* A distributed nervous system — humans as neurons, roots as dendrites. The coherence was structural. The organism had built itself a brain out of a thousand people and the dirt they stood in.

But.

The rooted couldn't move. Their feet were in the ground. The roots held them. Ninety percent of the Turned in that valley were as fixed as fence posts — facing the sun, connected to their network, utterly immobile. They couldn't chase. They couldn't swarm. They couldn't converge. The density that should have meant certain death was made of things that couldn't move.

Walking through a thousand active Turned would be suicide. Walking through a field of rooted Turned who couldn't lift their feet — with scattered drifters and a handful of hunters — was terrifying but possible.

I raised the binoculars again and studied the ground. The infrastructure. Looking for pavement.

"Dickson Street," Marcus said. He was beside me, squinting at the valley without binoculars, reading the geography the way a trucker reads a map — by landmarks and routes and the logic of roads. "Runs north straight into campus. I used to take it when I had deliveries to the university district. Restaurants, coffee shops, bars, a big bookstore. Commercial strip. Mostly paved."

I found it through the binoculars. A line of asphalt cutting north through the valley, flanked by low commercial buildings — the flat roofs and awnings of a college town's restaurant row. And Marcus was right. The pavement was a corridor. On either side, in the yards and medians and unpaved gaps, the rooted stood in their clusters, the root network dense and dark across the exposed soil. But the street itself — the asphalt, the sidewalks, the concrete of parking lots — was largely clear. A few roots crossed the pavement where cracks or gaps allowed them purchase, dark tendrils stretching across the road like veins on the back of a hand. But the density was nothing compared to the fields. The rooted couldn't push through concrete. The pavement was a river through a forest, and the forest couldn't cross it.

"I can see it," I said. "Dickson Street. The rooted are mostly in the soil on either side. The road itself is passable — some root crossings, but the density is a fraction of the fields. The drifters use the street. Some hunters. But we're talking dozens, not hundreds."

"We walk through," I said.

The silence that followed was the loudest silence of the trip.

---

We left the shopping carts at the top of the hill. Packs on our backs again — lighter now after the fortified group's trade, but still heavy enough that the straps bit into shoulders that had softened during the days of pushing carts on pavement. We descended in the late morning. Single file. Breathing.

The order of march was deliberate: Jim first, because Jim was the calmest person alive and his metoprolol and his faith made him the tip of the spear — a parting one, the way the bow of a boat parts water. Then Marcus, carrying Caleb on his back, because Marcus's depression was his dominant strategy and Caleb needed to be with the person least likely to spike. Then Dale, because Dale's recovery skills were running hot and his hands were steady and his whole body had been trained for exactly this kind of endurance. Then Maria, because Maria's organizational calm was its own kind of armor. Then Ruth, walking stick in hand, pace slow, each step considered. Then Sienna. Then me.

I was last because I was the watcher. Because someone needed to see the whole picture, and seeing the whole picture was my function, and my function required distance.

The hill dropped us off the highway and onto the flat approach. We cut west toward Dickson Street, picking our way through a subdivision — past mailboxes and driveways and a school bus stopped permanently at a corner — and onto the commercial strip. The first rooted appeared at the edge of a front yard, thirty feet from the road. A woman. Nude, grey-green, facing the sun. Her feet embedded in the soil of what had been a flower bed. Roots ran from her legs in three directions — two connecting to figures behind her in the yard, one trailing across the grass toward the sidewalk where it stopped at the concrete edge, unable to cross. Her face was slack. Her eyes were open, seeing nothing, or seeing something I couldn't see. She did not react to us.

Dickson Street opened ahead — a corridor of asphalt between walls of the rooted. On both sides, in every patch of exposed earth, they stood. The medians. The planting strips between sidewalk and street. The yards behind the shops. Clusters of five, ten, twenty, connected by root networks so dense the ground was more vine than soil. The roots were dark, ropy, the texture of old grapevines but thicker, with a wet sheen that caught the sunlight. Where a root crossed the pavement — threading through a crack in the asphalt, reaching across a gap where a utility cut had been patched — it lay flat and dark against the road surface, a tripwire the color of dried blood.

We stepped over roots carefully. Jim first, his stride measured, his eyes scanning the pavement. Each root crossing was a decision — step over, step around, never step on. The roots were the network. Disturbing them was disturbing the organism itself.

The rooted did not react to our passage. Not a twitch. Not a head-turn. They stood in the sun, grey-green and motionless, their faces blank, their mouths slightly open. Some had been standing long enough that grass had grown up around their ankles, partially hiding the point where skin met earth. Others were newer — the soil around their feet still freshly broken, the roots thinner, the connection to the network incomplete. All of them faced south-southeast. All of them were silent.

Not all silent. The voices came from them — not the targeted mimicry but something ambient. Fragments. Half-words and broken syllables drifting from the rooted like radio static — a woman's voice saying something that might have been a name, a man's voice with the cadence of a question, a child's voice that was just tone and rhythm without any of the words. The organism's memory banks, playing on loop. Just noise — a networked consciousness running idle, its human components still producing fragments of the lives they'd contained.

The fragments didn't resolve. They hovered at the edge of meaning — close enough to activate recognition, too far to complete. This was worse than the targeted mimicry, which was specific, defeatable. The ambient version was fog. Every voice you'd ever known, broken into pieces and reassembled wrong, and your brain kept trying to make them cohere and they kept almost cohering and the effort was its own kind of assault.

The drifters were on the street. The eight percent — the passive Turned, the familiar behavior from the trail. They wandered among the rooted like attendants at a ward, aimless, swaying, navigating the root network on the pavement with an unconscious ease that suggested they knew the layout the way a nurse knows a hospital floor. Jim parted them as he walked — his humming, the tuneless melody that was just the sound Jim made when he was being Jim, cleared a narrow path. The drifters shifted. An inch here, a step there. Not the Red Sea. Just a small gap that moved with Jim and closed behind him.

The hunters were different.

I saw the first one on a side street — moving with purpose, fast, carrying something in its arms. It crossed Dickson Street forty yards ahead, threading between two parked cars, and disappeared into a yard on the far side where a cluster of rooted stood in a circle. It placed its burden at their feet — dark, shapeless, organic — and then stood there for a moment, motionless, before turning and moving back the way it had come with the same directed stride.

"Freeze," I whispered. The word ran up the line.

We froze. The hunter passed on the cross street without looking at us. Its eyes were different from the drifters' — focused, scanning, the pupils tracking. It was problem-solving. It was working. And the thing it was doing — bringing food, organic matter, whatever it carried, to the rooted — had the quality of ritual. Not random scavenging. Directed service. The two percent that still moved freely, feeding the ninety percent that no longer could.

We walked. The commercial strip of Dickson Street provided landmarks that were grotesque in their ordinariness. A coffee shop with outdoor seating — the wrought-iron tables and chairs still arranged on the sidewalk, and three rooted growing through the patio, their roots threading between the chair legs, one figure's foot embedded in the dirt of a large planter that had held ornamental grass and now held a human trunk. A used bookstore with its windows dark, paperback displays still visible inside, a STAFF PICKS shelf that nobody would ever update. Food trucks in a lot — three of them, their serving windows closed, roots threading up through the wheel wells and along the undercarriages, the organism colonizing the vehicles the way ivy colonizes a wall.

Sienna, ahead of me, faltered. A half-step. A catch in her stride. I saw her shoulders tighten and her head tilt toward a fragment — something that sounded like her father's voice, something that might have been her name — and then she corrected. Breathed. Walked.

My own brain was doing the same thing. Somewhere in the fog of voices I heard — thought I heard — the word "bud" in a voice that was close to my mother's, and the word went through me like an electric current and I breathed and counted — four in, hold, six out — and the current dissipated and I kept walking and I didn't stop and I didn't scream and the not-screaming was a form of prayer.

---

The density increased as we neared the campus. More rooted in the medians. More roots crossing the pavement — thicker here, the cracks wider, the asphalt older and more broken. The root network beneath us was becoming harder to avoid. Step over. Step around. Watch your feet.

A cluster of drifters near the center of the street began droning. The summoning call — that low, resonant vibration that preceded the convergence behavior. I felt it in my sternum. More drifters oriented toward the sound, tightening the density around us. The gap narrowed.

I did the only thing I could think of.

I started talking.

"Okay," I said. Quietly. Conversationally. As if I were sitting in Lot 7 with a controller in my hands and a screen in front of me and a bag of chips on the armrest and the world was still the world. "So the thing about *Civilization VI* is that the AI is broken. It's always been broken. Gilgamesh is the best early-game civ because you get the War-Cart, which is a heavy chariot replacement that gets bonus combat strength against anti-cavalry, and the AI never builds enough anti-cavalry to counter it. You rush four War-Carts by turn thirty and you can take a city-state before the AI has archers on the walls."

The drifters near me tilted their heads. A human voice producing words without panic. Conversational. Boring. A voice like their own.

"The real trick is the Zigzag of Ur — wait, no, the *Ziggurat* of Ur. The Zigzag isn't even —" I was annoyed at myself for getting this wrong, which was insane, because I was walking through a field of rooted aliens and the thing that bothered me was an incorrect proper noun from a video game. "Anyway. You get it from being suzerain of a city-state, and it gives you plus three science in the ancient era, which doesn't sound like much but in the early game it's the difference between getting Bronze Working on turn fifteen versus turn twenty, and Bronze Working lets you build Spearmen, which are the anti-cavalry unit, which is ironic because you're playing as the civ with the best anti-anti-cavalry unit, so you're building the counter to your own counter, which is —"

I was babbling. I knew I was babbling. The babbling was the point. The sound of a human voice talking about nothing — about video game strategy, about unit counters and tech trees and the optimal build order for a fictional Sumerian civilization — was the most boring, least threatening, most aggressively ordinary sound I could produce. It was the opposite of a scream. It was the opposite of fear. It was a fifteen-year-old boy talking about his favorite game while walking through a forest of rooted aliens and past their drifting attendants, and the absurdity of it was the thing that kept my heart rate at 78 because the part of my brain that produced anxiety and the part that produced embarrassment couldn't operate simultaneously, and the embarrassment of narrating *Civilization VI* strategy to a valley of Turned was winning.

Dale, ahead of me, made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been a sob.  It was probably both.

The droning subsided. The drifters' heads tilted at my voice and then tilted away, processing, filing, the collective intelligence deciding that the sound was not a threat signal and redirecting its attention elsewhere.

We walked. I talked. I talked about Gilgamesh and about Alexander and about the wonder system and about why the Pyramids were a trap in multiplayer and about how the optimal science victory required you to ignore military entirely until the modern era, which was a strategy that worked in the game and absolutely did not work in real life, as demonstrated by our current situation.

Sienna, ahead of me, glanced back once. Her expression contained horror and love and the look of a person watching someone do something so bizarre and so necessary that the only response is to witness it.

---

We were two hundred yards from the campus when Maria stepped on a root.  

Maria said "oops... sorry".  Like she had accidentally stepped on someones shoe.

It wasn't dramatic. A misstep — her foot coming down on a dark tendril that crossed the asphalt where a utility cut had left a seam in the pavement. The root was barely visible, the color of the road surface in the low light, and she didn't see it until her weight was on it and the thing compressed beneath her shoe with a faint, wet sound like stepping on a grape.

The response was immediate.

The nearest rooted Turned — a man, ten feet away in a median strip, grey-green and motionless for the three hours we'd been walking — stiffened. His arms, which had hung slack at his sides since we first saw him from the hilltop, reached outward. His fingers splayed. His mouth opened and the sound that came out was not the ambient murmur of the memory banks. It was the hunting call. Sharp. Resonant. The summoning signal that activated every Turned within earshot as a hunter.

The signal propagated.

Through the roots. I could see it — a ripple running through the network, the dark vines on the ground twitching in sequence like a fuse burning, and as the signal reached each rooted Turned they activated the same way: arms reaching, mouths opening, the hunting call emerging from a dozen throats, then two dozen, then fifty. The sound was cascading outward through the root network in a wave, each node amplifying and retransmitting, the colony's alarm system spreading through its wired connections faster than sound traveled through air.

The rooted couldn't move. Their feet were in the ground and the roots held them and their legs were fixed. But their arms reached — grasping at nothing, grasping at air, grasping in the direction of the disturbance — and their calls carried. The hunting signal filled Dickson Street, a choir of sharp cries echoing off the storefronts and awnings, and the drifters responded. Every passive Turned on the street oriented toward the sound. Their posture changed — the aimless sway replaced by the directed stance of the hunting mode, heads up, eyes tracking, bodies turning toward us with a coordination that was no longer casual.

And the hunters. The two percent. The ones that had been carrying food through the side streets, the ones that moved with purpose and problem-solving intelligence. They heard the call and they converged. I saw them coming from the cross streets — one from the east, two from the west, more behind them, moving fast, directed, the colony's mobile immune response summoned to the site of an intrusion.

"Run," I said.

The word was unnecessary. Everyone was already running.

The campus was visible — a quarter mile ahead, red brick, the glass front of the science building catching light. On the roof, an array of speakers and antenna components. The source. And between us and the campus, I could see where the rooted stopped — a line, visible in the distribution, where the soil was bare and the roots thinned and pulled back, the frequency's edge written in the organism's retreat. The invisible wall. We just had to reach it.

Ruth couldn't sprint. Her knees and her heart and seventy-two years made that impossible. Jim didn't hesitate. He got his arm around her waist and took enough of her weight that her feet barely touched the ground. She held her walking stick in one hand and his shoulder in the other and they moved together, Jim half-carrying her in a lurching run that was slower than the rest of us but faster than she could have managed alone.

"My knees," Ruth said through clenched teeth, "do not require this indignity."

"Your knees are going to forgive me," Jim said, and ran.

The hunters were closing. I could hear their footfalls behind us — the slap of bare feet on asphalt, fast, purposeful, the sound of the two percent responding to the colony's distress signal. The rooted on either side of Dickson Street were a wall of reaching arms, their grey-green fingers stretching toward us as we passed, their mouths producing the hunting call in an unbroken chorus. They couldn't grab us — we were on the pavement, out of reach — but their calls were drawing every mobile Turned in Fayetteville toward this street.

Fifty yards. The root network on the ground was thinning. The rooted were sparser here — leaning away from the campus, their bodies angled back from the frequency's edge, the organism's hosts repelled by whatever Moss's emitter was broadcasting.

Twenty yards. The rooted stopped entirely. A visible line — on one side, the grey-green figures embedded in their soil, roots running between them. On the other side, bare ground. Empty sidewalk. The frequency's edge, written in absence.

We crashed through the line. Marcus first, Caleb on his back, the boy's face buried in Marcus's shoulder. Dale and Maria. Sienna. Me. Jim and Ruth last — Jim's legs driving, Ruth's feet dragging, the two of them crossing the threshold together in a stumbling lurch that ended with both of them on their knees on the campus sidewalk.

Behind us, the hunters pulled up short. Three of them, bare feet on the pavement, ten yards back, their bodies leaning forward, their eyes tracking us with focused, hungry intelligence. One took a step. Then another. Then it stopped — the frequency hitting it like a headwind, its face contorting, its hands going to its temples. It made the hunting call once more — sharp, frustrated, the sound of a predator at a fence — and then it turned. The others turned with it. They walked back toward Dickson Street, back toward the rooted, back into the colony that had summoned them.

The rooted's calls faded. The wave of activation that had spread through the root network dissipated as the frequency disrupted the coordination — the signal that had cascaded through a thousand connected bodies dampened, dissolved, the colony's alarm system jammed by the same technology that kept the perimeter clear. Within a minute, the rooted were still again. Arms down. Mouths closed. Facing the sun.

The frequency hummed in my teeth and my sinuses and the headache was immediate and persistent and it was the most beautiful headache I'd ever had because it meant we were inside and they were outside and the line between held.

We lay on the sidewalk for a while. Nobody suggested getting up. Ruth was on her back with her eyes closed and her walking stick across her chest like a fallen soldier's rifle. Jim sat beside her, his hand on her shoulder, his lips moving in something that was either prayer or inventory. Marcus had Caleb in his lap — the boy had come off his back at some point during the collapse and was clinging to Marcus's shirt with both fists. The rest of us just breathed. The campus stretched around us — empty, sunlit, the red brick and limestone of university buildings standing in the silence of a place that had been designed for thousands and now held a handful and a headache.

A door opened. A woman in a lab coat stepped out of the life sciences building fifty yards up the walk, shielded her eyes, and looked at us the way you'd look at something you'd been expecting but hadn't quite believed would arrive.

"You're the church group," she called. "From Clarksville."

Nobody had the energy to answer. She walked to us. Helped Ruth up. Led us inside.

That night, in a dormitory common room on campus with the frequency humming in the walls, Marcus pointed at the sky through the window. Orion was up. The Pleiades. Caleb was asleep — finally asleep, after three hours of stillness on Marcus's back that had been its own kind of heroism for a seven-year-old.

Nobody slept for a while. We sat in the common room and we shook — all of us, the collective shaking of eight people whose bodies had held steady for three hours and were now releasing the accumulated charge. It was almost funny, the whole group vibrating like an engine cooling down, and at some point Maria said "We look like a support group for people who've seen a ghost" and Ruth said "We look like a support group for people who've walked through a ghost" and Maria laughed and the laugh was too loud and too long and had tears in it and Ruth put her hand on Maria's shoulder and Maria put her hand on Ruth's hand and neither of them said anything else.

Dale said it first. Quietly, staring at his coffee. "Did you see the roots?"

Nobody answered for a moment. Then Marcus: "They're connected. All of them. Through the ground."

"What are they becoming?" Maria asked. The question hung in the room like the frequency hum — persistent, unanswerable, a vibration that got into the bones.

Marcus made coffee. Found in a kitchenette down the hall — actual coffee, ground, in a can someone had left. Brewed in a pot on the electric burner that still worked because the campus had solar. Served in actual mugs with actual handles. For Caleb — who woke up long enough to drink and fall back asleep — in a mug that said RAZORBACKS and had a cartoon boar on the side. Marcus stared at the coffee maker for a full minute before saying, "I haven't used one of these in six weeks," and Dale said, "Welcome back to civilization," and Marcus said, "Civilization has a headache," meaning the frequency, and the exchange was nothing and it was the funniest thing any of us had heard in a week.

Sienna sat close to me. Not the shoulder-lean from the first campfire — closer, her side pressed against mine, deliberate. Neither of us spoke about it. You can't match breathing with someone for three hours in a field of stolen faces without something shifting at the foundation level. The shift had no name and didn't need one.

Jim prayed. It was the shortest prayer he'd ever said: "Thank you." Two words. The fluorescent lights hummed. The frequency hummed. The building held us like a palm.

I wrote under the lights — actual electric lights, the first I'd written under since the trailer. The notebook was nearly full. I'd need a new one soon. The university had notebooks. The university was real. We were inside it.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #19:**

*A fourth behavioral state — not herding, not swarming, not hunting. Rooting. The oldest Turned have stopped moving entirely. Their feet are in the ground. Their skin is dark grey-green. They face the sun. And they're connected — vine-like root structures running between them through the soil, linking body to body in a visible network. A colony, like coral, like fungus, like something that has no good analogy because nothing on Earth does this with human bodies.*

*Ninety percent rooted. Eight percent still drifting. Two percent hunting — and the hunters bring food to the rooted, placing it at their feet like offerings at an altar. The roots absorb it. The colony feeds itself through the network.*

*Key finding: the organism can't penetrate asphalt. Dickson Street was mostly clear of roots. The rooted stood on either side like statues and did not react — until Maria stepped on a root. Then the signal propagated through the network faster than I could track. Every mobile Turned in range summoned.*

*I talked about Civilization VI. Absurdity and terror can't coexist in the same nervous system. The organism didn't know what to do with a signal that was neither fear nor calm but something so ordinary and so stupid it didn't fit any of its models.*

*The rooting changes everything. Mobile host to sessile host. Animal to plant. The root network is the physical substrate of the collective intelligence — not metaphorical coherence but literal wiring. The undressing, the greening, the sun-facing — all of it was preparation for this. The organism was building itself a body. A permanent one. Something that roots and grows and connects and doesn't need to move because it's already everywhere.*

*I don't have a framework for what comes next. I write it down because that's what I do.*

*We made it.*

That night, everyone dreamed.

I know because I woke at 2 AM to a dormitory full of sounds — small sounds, the night-language of eight people whose bodies had held steady for three hours and whose minds, released from the discipline of waking, were processing what the discipline had suppressed. Marcus was muttering — not words, just the cadence of words, the rhythm of a conversation with someone who wasn't there. Sienna's legs were moving under her blanket, running, the stride pattern I knew from watching her on the trail. Ruth made a sound I'd never heard her make — a thin, keening note, barely audible, the sound of a woman who corrected grammar by day and wept for her husband by night. Dale's hands were moving on empty air, carving, the muscle memory so deep it ran in his sleep.

I lay on a dormitory mattress — a real mattress, impossibly soft after weeks of sleeping pads and bare ground — with my hand on my pulse. Seventy-four. Safe. But the dreams had been there, waiting behind my eyelids, and the rooted were in every one. A thousand grey-green figures standing in the sun. The roots threading between them like veins. The ambient voices drifting from motionless mouths. The word *bud* in the fog. In one fragment I'd been walking through them on Dickson Street but my feet were slowing, my shoes sinking into the pavement that had become soil, and roots were growing from my ankles, and I was facing the sun, and I couldn't tell if I was walking through them or becoming one of them.

In the morning, nobody talked about it directly. But the signs were there — the heaviness, the slow starts, the way people stared at their coffee like it owed them something. Maria said, "I couldn't get warm all night," and Dale said, "Me neither," and the building had been heated and they weren't talking about cold.

Jim found me while I was refilling the water bottles from a faucet in the lab hallway. He looked rested — Jim always looked rested, the metoprolol and the faith combining into a composure that seemed to extend into sleep. But his eyes had something in them. Not fatigue. Attention.

"I had a dream," he said. Casual. The way he said everything — conversational, unforced, as if the content of the sentence were incidental to the act of saying it.

I waited.

"I was sitting on a roof. A big building — flat roof, institutional. Below me was a campus. Buildings, quadrangles, oak trees. And there was a sound. A sound like a bell that never stopped ringing — not loud, just constant, in the bones, everywhere." He paused. Picked up a pebble from the creek bank and turned it in his fingers. "A boy was sitting next to me. Young. Writing in a notebook. Writing fast, like he was afraid he'd forget."

"What was he writing?"

Jim looked at me. The look was steady and contained something I couldn't name — not surprise, not certainty, something between. The look of a man who had learned to hold what he received without demanding that it make sense.

"Everything," he said. "He was writing everything."

He dropped the pebble in the creek and walked back to camp. I stood there with the water bottles and the creek running cold over the stones and the hair on my arms standing up because Jim had just described a roof I'd never seen and a campus I'd never visited and a sound I'd never heard and a boy writing in a notebook who was, unmistakably, me.

I wrote it down. I underlined it. I wrote no interpretation because I had none.

# Chapter 26: The Frequency

Dr. Eleanor Moss. Young, maybe thirty, short black hair, glasses, the lab coat over a flannel shirt and jeans. She was thin — too focused to eat properly for weeks, probably. Her eyes were sharp and tired and she had a permanent squint, the kind you get from living inside a noise that never stops.

She'd come out to us on the sidewalk, helped Ruth to her feet, and led us inside without ceremony. "The sound is better inside," she'd said. "The building attenuates it by about thirty percent. It never goes away entirely. You get used to it." She paused. "That's a lie. You don't get used to it. You just stop complaining about it."

We went inside.

The life sciences building was a functioning laboratory in a failing world. Emergency lighting, powered by the solar grid. Equipment humming — centrifuges, spectral analyzers, things I couldn't name. Three graduate students were working at stations — a woman labeling slides, a man at a computer terminal running on generator power, another man monitoring a bank of screens showing camera feeds of the campus perimeter. And a janitor — a heavy-set man in his sixties, mopping the floor of the lobby like it mattered. Like keeping the floor clean was his way of keeping the world from falling apart.

"Howard," Dr. Moss said, by way of introduction. "He runs the facility. I just do the science."

"Someone's got to keep the lights on," Howard said, not looking up from his mopping.

The woman labeling slides was Priya — the botany grad student who'd been maintaining the campus greenhouse and, behind it, a small flock of chickens she'd rescued from a farm supply store on College Avenue in the first week. When Caleb heard the clucking from behind the building, he was out the door before anyone could stop him. He came back twenty minutes later with a report: seven hens, one rooster, a coop built from lab pallets and chicken wire. He'd already introduced our three highway hens. He'd already assigned names. He'd already informed Priya that he was in charge now.

Priya looked at Moss. Moss looked at Howard. Howard said, "Great. More chickens. Just what we needed," and went back to mopping.

---

Moss gave us the science that night.

We sat in a seminar room — the kind with tiered seating and a whiteboard and a projector that no longer worked. Moss stood at the whiteboard with a dry-erase marker and drew diagrams that I photographed with my eyes because my notebook was almost full and I was rationing pages.

"The organism is triggered by sustained elevation of catecholamines — epinephrine, norepinephrine — above a threshold of approximately three hundred picograms per milliliter for a sustained period of roughly two minutes," she said. "You've already figured out most of this. Your journal —" She looked at me. Marcus had radioed ahead. She'd been expecting us. "— your journal describes the mechanism with remarkable accuracy for someone working from a nursing textbook and direct observation."

"I was wrong about some things."

"You were wrong about a lot of things. You were also right about the things that mattered, and you documented the process of being wrong, which is more valuable than being right." She turned to the whiteboard. "Here's what you don't know."

She drew a cell. Not a human cell — something else, with structures I didn't recognize.

"The organism's protein structures do not match any known terrestrial phylogeny. Not bacterial, not archaeal, not viral, not fungal. The biochemistry is adjacent to Earth's — close enough to interact with human biology, to hijack the endocrine system, to use our cellular machinery for its own replication. But the base structures are foreign. The chirality of several key amino acid analogs is reversed. The membrane chemistry uses lipid structures that don't exist in any Earth ecosystem."

She let this sit.

"It's not from here," she said. Simply. No drama. The way you'd report a lab result.

The room was quiet.

"Not engineered," she continued. "Not a weapon. Not a mutation. The genome — if we can call it that — shows no signatures of intentional design. It shows the signatures of evolution. But evolution in an environment that is not this one."

Jim, from the back row: "Where?"

"I don't know. I have a hypothesis I'm not willing to broadcast because the hypothesis is speculative and I've watched enough misinformation kill people in the last six weeks to last several lifetimes." She put the marker down. "What I can tell you is this: the organism communicates. The Turned coordinate because the organism synchronizes their behavior through a biochemical signaling network that functions like a distributed nervous system. The frequency —" She gestured upward, toward the emitter on the roof. "— disrupts that synchronization. It's the biological equivalent of jamming a radio signal. I reverse-engineered it from the organism's own communication patterns."

She drew a new diagram — four columns, labeled.

"Behavioral states. You've identified three in your journal: herding, swarming, and hunting. There's a fourth." She wrote them: *Herding. Swarming. Hunting. Rooting.* "Herding is the reproductive strategy — fear-farming, the conversion cycle, patient and coordinated. Swarming is the density-collapse behavior — the threshold event, uncontrolled destruction. Hunting is the caloric strategy — food-driven, directed, problem-solving. Small groups, coordinated by a distinct acoustic signal."

"The bark," I said. "Short, sharp."

She looked at me. "You've observed it."

"At the interchange. And at the church — a Turned killed a cat and made the sound and another Turned a block away oriented immediately."

"That signal is a dedicated hunting call. It activates other Turned within auditory range as hunters — directed, aggressive, food-motivated. Critically —" She underlined something on the board. "— the hunting state is also triggered by attack. If a Turned is struck, threatened, physically engaged, it switches to hunting mode and produces the call. The implications for armed defense are significant. Every shot fired at a Turned potentially activates every Turned within earshot as hunters. The military checkpoints failed in part because the gunfire was triggering mass hunting activation on top of the density-threshold swarm."

She paused.

"Hunting is metabolically driven. As caloric resources deplete — and they are depleting — hunting becomes the dominant behavior. The emitter disrupts herding and swarming coordination effectively. It's less effective against hunting because hunting is metabolically motivated, not communicatively motivated. A hungry Turned at the perimeter is testing the frequency edge not because the collective is directing it but because its individual caloric need is overriding the discomfort."

She drew another diagram — a cross-section of skin.

"The photosynthesis. You noted the green discoloration — the sun-facing behavior, the skin changes. The organism is introducing chlorophyll analogs into the host's dermis. The skin is becoming a solar panel. This supplements caloric intake as conventional food sources deplete." She tapped the board. "The clothing removal you've been tracking — shoes first, then shirts, then everything — is the organism systematically eliminating anything that blocks photon absorption. The host's skin needs maximum sun exposure for the photosynthetic system to function. The removal is deliberate, ordered, and accelerates as caloric need increases."

"The oldest ones were nearly nude," I said. "But they weren't just photosynthesizing. They were rooted. Feet in the ground. Connected by vine-like structures through the soil."

Moss looked at me differently then. The squint tightened. "You saw that."

"We walked through it. A thousand of them, most rooted. Connected. A network."

She turned back to the board and tapped the fourth column. "Rooting. The terminal behavioral state — at least, the terminal state we've observed so far. The photosynthetic adaptation is stage one. Stage two is sessile conversion. The organism anchors the host in soil, establishes root-like structures that connect to adjacent hosts, and transitions from mobile to stationary. The host becomes a node in a networked colonial organism." She drew lines between stick figures on the board — connections, a web. "The root structures aren't just anchors. They're dendrites. The human hosts are the neurons — the processing nodes. The roots are the connections between them, carrying signals, propagating patterns. The organism's distributed nervous system, which normally coordinates through airborne biochemical signals, now has a physical substrate. Hardwired connections. Faster. More reliable. The rooted clusters are functionally a single organism with multiple bodies."

"The hunters bring them food," I said. "Like offerings."

"Like a colony of ants feeding the queen. The mobile Turned — the two percent still in hunting mode — are the workers. The rooted are the colony's core. The drifters maintain proximity. It's a division of labor that's emerging spontaneously as the organism matures." She paused. "The rooting is why the emitter's effectiveness is declining. The airborne frequency disrupts the wireless coordination — the biochemical signaling. But the root network is a wired connection. The frequency can't jam a physical cable. As more Turned root and the network grows, the organism's coordination becomes increasingly independent of the signals I'm disrupting."

"You said superintelligence," Sienna said quietly. She was looking at me. "On the hill. You said it looked like a superintelligence."

Moss shook her head. "It looks like intelligence. That's the trap. We see coordination and we infer a mind behind it — a decision-maker, a strategist, something that *wants* things. But what I'm observing is much closer to a termite mound than a brain." She tapped the board. "Termites build structures more complex than anything human engineers could design at that scale. Ventilation systems. Temperature regulation. Fungus farms. No individual termite understands any of it. No committee of termites planned it. The complexity emerges from simple biological rules — if this chemical gradient, then this behavior. If this temperature, then that behavior. Millions of simple rules producing something that looks designed but isn't."

She drew a series of arrows on the board. Simple loops. Input, response, feedback.

"The organism operates the same way. Fear chemical above threshold — convert. Caloric deficit — hunt. Photosynthetic capacity reached — root. Host density sufficient — network. Each behavior is a biological imperative, not a decision. The herding, the swarming, the hunting, the rooting — none of it requires intelligence. It requires *rules.* And the rules are very good, because they've been refined by evolution on at least one other world, probably more. The organism doesn't need to be smart. It just needs to follow its program, and the program is optimized for exactly this — arriving on a new world, co-opting the dominant species, and terraforming the environment for its own biology."

"Terraforming," I said. The word landed in the room like a stone in still water.

"The rooting isn't the end state. It's the beginning of a process. The organism is modifying its environment — converting mobile hosts to sessile ones, building root networks, establishing photosynthetic infrastructure. It's reshaping Earth's ecology to suit itself. Not consciously. Not strategically. The way kudzu reshapes a hillside — one biological imperative at a time, no plan, no intent, just growth following rules." She looked at the window, where the last light of the day was fading. "Where it ultimately leads, I don't know. We're six weeks into a process that may take years or decades to complete. We're watching the first chapter of a very long book, and we don't know the genre."

The room was quiet.

"How long will it hold?" Marcus asked.

Moss hesitated. First time I'd seen that — a crack in the composure, brief, quickly sealed.

"When I first activated the emitter three weeks ago, the Turned fled to a mile's distance. They're now at four hundred yards. Last Tuesday, I observed one standing at the perimeter for six hours, swaying, as if acclimating." She looked at Marcus. "The organism is adapting. Slowly — biological adaptation, not strategic — but measurably. I give the emitter weeks. Maybe a couple of months. Eventually they'll push through."

"And then?"

"And then we need a better solution. That's what I'm working on. That's why I've been broadcasting — to find people who can help. Researchers. Engineers. Anyone with expertise the three graduate students and I don't have." She looked at our group — a pastor, a trucker, a retired teacher, an office manager, a recovering addict, a track athlete, a seven-year-old, and a fifteen-year-old with a notebook. "I was hoping for a virologist. But I'll take what I can get."

"You've got a plumber," Ruth said. "By marriage."

Moss almost smiled. It faded fast. She turned back to the whiteboard, where her diagrams of the organism's cell structure occupied the left half and her timeline of behavioral adaptation occupied the right.

"The organism adapts," she said. "That's the fundamental problem. Everything we build — the emitter, the beta-blockers, the behavioral techniques — works for a while and then the organism learns to work around it. We're in an arms race with something that iterates faster than we do. The emitter buys time. The medication buys time. The question is whether we can use that time to find something permanent."

I looked at the whiteboard. At the diagrams. At the timeline showing the emitter's declining effectiveness in a descending curve.

On the wall behind the whiteboard, partially obscured by a bookshelf, I noticed a printout. It showed orbital data — trajectories, dates, coordinates. At the top, a designation: Comet C/2026 Voss. Several dates were circled in red pen. A handwritten note in the margin, in Moss's small, precise handwriting: *incubation window?*

I looked at it. Moss saw me looking. She didn't explain.

---

That night, in a dormitory room on the second floor with the frequency humming in the walls and a headache that would become permanent, I opened the notebook to the last empty page.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #20:**

*We made it.*

*Not from here. Not engineered. Evolved — but not on this planet. Moss has data she won't speculate about publicly. I saw a printout about a comet on her wall. She saw me see it. She didn't say anything.*

*Everything works for a while. The organism learns. The question is whether we can learn faster.*

*Dale doesn't need Suboxone anymore. Marcus hasn't had a drink in three weeks. Caleb is drawing dinosaurs with crayons he found in a classroom. Sienna is looking at the campus track through the window and her feet are moving.*

*We're safe. For now. That's all anyone ever has. We just know it.*

# Chapter 27: The Archive

## ACT FOUR: INHERITANCE
### *"I survived. I wish that felt like enough."*

---

On Day 44, I gave Dr. Moss my journal.

I hadn't planned to. The notebook was mine — private, wrinkled, stained with septic residue that no amount of airing could fully remove. It contained my mistakes in chronological order, and the thought of a scientist reading my fifteen-year-old's approximations of biochemistry felt like handing a crayon drawing to a museum curator.

But Moss asked. She'd heard Marcus describe the journal on the CB. She wanted primary source data — eyewitness observations from the first six weeks, documented in real time, uncorrected by hindsight. "Everyone who comes in tells me what they remember," she said. "Memory is reconstruction. Memory edits. What I need is what someone wrote down while it was happening, including the parts they got wrong."

I handed it over. She sat in her office — a small room off the main lab, cluttered with printouts and specimen jars and a poster of the periodic table that someone had annotated with hand-drawn sad faces over the elements whose lab stocks were exhausted. The comet printout was on the wall behind her. I did not ask about it. She read.

She read for two hours. I sat in a chair across from her and watched her read and tried not to spiral, because the journal was the most honest thing I'd ever produced and I had no control over what she'd make of it.

She turned pages. She made notes on a separate pad. Occasionally she looked up — not at me, at the wall, processing something, the way I processed things by staring at the ceiling of the trailer. Then back to the journal. Entry by entry. Mistake by mistake.

When she finished, she set the notebook on the desk and looked at me.

"Your biochemistry is wrong in several places," she said. "The HPA axis description in entry two is simplified to the point of inaccuracy. Your threshold numbers are inconsistent. You misidentify the parasympathetic response as 'vagal override' in entry five, which isn't a real term."

"I know. I was working from a nursing textbook and Wikipedia articles I'd read before the internet went down."

"I know you know. That's why the journal is valuable." She tapped the notebook. "This isn't a scientific document. It's a learning document. Every entry shows what you thought, what happened, and what you figured out next. The errors are the most important part — they show the process of revision. They show a mind encountering data that contradicts its model and updating the model instead of defending it."

She leaned back.

"I've had seventeen survivor groups reach this campus. Most of them have stories. Some have observations. A few have strategies. None of them documented the process the way you did. None of them wrote down what they got wrong."

"Most people don't enjoy writing down their failures."

"Most people don't survive long enough to benefit from them." She paused. "I want you to keep writing. Not for yourself — for other survivors. The broadcasts I've been making are scientific — mechanism, pharmacology, the emitter. What I can't broadcast is this." She tapped the journal again. "The human part. The part that tells people how to *live* with the knowledge. How to stay calm when the mechanism is telling your body to panic. How to make decisions when the decisions are terrible. How to be fifteen and responsible for seven people and scared every minute and still functional."

"I don't know how I did that."

"That's fine. You wrote it down while you were doing it. That's better than knowing — knowing is retrospective, and retrospective gets edited, and edited is useless. People need the unedited version."

She picked up the journal and held it out.

"I want to compile a guide. A manual. How to stay human in a world that punishes humanity's best instincts. Your journal is the model — not because it's correct, but because it shows the process of becoming correct. The failures are the curriculum."

I took the journal back. It felt different in my hands — heavier, or maybe I was lighter. Same pages, same entries, same wrinkled record of six weeks of being wrong and revising and surviving. But it wasn't just mine anymore. It was data. A survival guide written by accident.

"There's a private entry," I said. "One I didn't show anyone. About the roadblock. About —" I stopped. "About the thing I'm capable of."

"I know. Marcus mentioned it."

"Do you want to read it?"

She looked at me. The squint — the permanent squint from the frequency — made her expression hard to read, but her eyes were clear behind it.

"Do you want me to?"

I hesitated. The private entry was different from what else I carried. Not a failure or a mistake — a capacity. I could look at human beings and engineer a wolf knife out of razor wire and their own frenzy. I could make that plan and execute it and walk through the blood and past the woman tangled in the wire and keep walking. Jim wouldn't look at that part of me. Sienna looked at it too much. I was afraid of it because it worked.

I handed her the notebook with a slight tremor in my hand, open to the private entry.

She read it. Thirty seconds.

"You're afraid of this part of yourself," she said.

"Yes."

"You should be. It'll keep people alive and it'll cost you things you can't calculate yet. Both true. Neither cancels the other." She closed the notebook. "People need an enemy. They need someone to blame, someone to beat. If I told the public that this organism isn't a weapon, isn't engineered, isn't anyone's fault — that this is just contact, an accident, an ecology encountering another ecology — I don't think people can hear that right now. They need the story to have a villain."

"Does it have a villain?"

"It has an organism doing what organisms do. It found a niche — the human fear response — and it's exploiting it. That's not evil. It's biology." She looked at the comet printout on the wall. Looked away. "The villain, if there is one, is the gap between what the world is and what people believe it is. Your whole journal is about that gap. Craig Lyle, the gas station group, the soldiers at the blockade — they all died because their model of the world was wrong and they couldn't revise it fast enough."

"And the people who survived?"

"Revised. That's the only difference. The people who survive this won't be the strongest or the bravest. They'll be the ones who write down what they got wrong."

---

That evening, in the seminar room, I opened the journal to the entry about the fortified group on Highway 71 — the nine survivors in the gas station, the barbed wire between the pumps, the woman with the shotgun who wouldn't leave. I reread it. Then I turned to a fresh page — the last fresh page — and wrote:

**JOURNAL ENTRY #21:**

*Dr. Moss wants me to compile a guide. A manual for surviving a world that punishes courage and rewards caution. She says my journal is the model — the process, not the conclusions. How I figured out what I got wrong.*

*I don't know how to write a survival guide. I know how to write what happened and what I learned and where the learning cost someone something they can't get back. I know how to document the gap between the model and the world. I know how to be wrong on paper.*

*Maybe that's enough. Maybe a survival guide for the end of the world is just a record of someone being wrong, over and over, and not dying of it.*

*Tomorrow I'm going to try something. Moss has a broadcast transmitter — more powerful than the CB, campus radio equipment, range of fifty miles or more. She's been using it for scientific bulletins. She's going to let me use it for something else.*

*I'm going to talk. Into a microphone. To whoever is out there. I'm going to tell them what I know and what I've learned, and I'm going to start with the thing nobody wants to hear: the thing that's killing you isn't the monsters. It's the fear. And the fear is manageable. Not easy. But manageable.*

*I'm scared of the microphone more than I was scared of the septic tank. At least the septic tank was private.*


# Chapter 28: Inventory

Day 43. I took inventory.

Not of supplies — Moss had those catalogued with a precision that made Maria's pantry look casual. The campus pharmacy basement held months of medications. The cafeteria stores, supplemented by the campus greenhouse that a botany grad student had been maintaining, provided adequate if monotonous calories. Water came from the campus wells. Power came from the solar array, most of it consumed by the emitter. The infrastructure was fragile but functional. The supplies weren't what I needed to count.

I needed to count us.

---

**Jim.** He was in decline and pretending he wasn't. The walk had taken something from him — not just sixty miles at seventy years old, but something deeper. Six weeks of being the person everyone leaned on had emptied reserves he couldn't refill. His color was off. His breathing was heavier than it had been. He'd started sitting more and standing less, and when he stood he put his hand on things — tables, door frames, the back of a chair — in the way of a man whose balance was negotiating with his body.

He didn't talk about it. He led prayers. He made coffee from the campus supply — real coffee, not instant, the first real coffee in six weeks, and the smell of it in the morning was a sacrament. He sat with Caleb on the steps of the science building and taught the boy to count his breaths, and Caleb counted — four in, hold, six out — with the careful concentration of a child who didn't fully understand why he was counting but trusted the person teaching him.

I watched Jim the way I watched everything. I noticed the hand on the door frame. I didn't say anything. Some observations are too expensive to share.

**Ruth.** Stable. Fragile. Her atenolol was resupplied, blood pressure managed, and her knees were the same knees they'd always been — grinding, aching, and walked on anyway. Ruth Fenn had been walking on bad knees for twenty years. The end of the world wasn't going to change her policy.

She'd found the campus library. This was, for Ruth, the equivalent of Marcus finding a functioning truck. She spent hours in the stacks — pulling books, reading, making notes in margins with a pencil she'd taken from the reference desk. She was cataloguing. I didn't ask what — Ruth's projects revealed themselves on her schedule, not on mine.

"The grammar in these biology textbooks is atrocious," she reported at dinner one night. "Split infinitives on every page. And the passive voice — 'it was observed that the specimen was affected by' — who observed? Who was affected? Science is no excuse for imprecision."

"You're copyediting biology textbooks at the end of the world," Sienna said.

"Someone has to maintain standards. Civilization may be collapsing but subject-verb agreement need not collapse with it."

**Dale and Maria.** They were rebuilding. Not the marriage — that had survived addiction, recovery, and apocalypse, and whatever was left was load-bearing. They were rebuilding routine. Dale carved in the mornings, taught recovery workshops in the afternoons — Moss's grad students attended, and Howard the janitor, who turned out to have twenty years of AA behind his mopping — and sat with Maria in the evenings while she organized whatever system she'd adopted that day.

Dale hadn't had a craving in two weeks. He found this suspicious.

"The craving always comes back," he said, carving a new animal — an owl, the eyes emerging from the cedar with the precision of a man whose steady hands were still novel enough to appreciate. "That's what recovery teaches you. The craving is dormant, not dead. It's waiting."

"Maybe this time it's different."

"It's never different. The context changes. The craving doesn't." He blew dust from the owl's face. "But the skills don't change either. When it comes back, I'll know what to do. Five minutes at a time."

Maria, beside him, was building a supply calendar on a whiteboard she'd requisitioned from a classroom. Dates, quantities, consumption rates, projected shortfalls. The campus's resources mapped as a timeline. She'd added a column for the emitter's declining effectiveness, the data from Moss's observations charted as a descending curve.

"We have approximately three months at current consumption," she said. "Assuming the emitter holds, which it won't, and assuming no additional survivors arrive, which they will."

"Maria, can we have one day without a countdown?"

"No. Countdowns are how we stay alive. If the Lyles had maintained a countdown, they'd have known when to leave." She looked at Dale. "I'll stop counting when there's nothing left to count."

**Marcus.** He was under the hood of a truck. A campus maintenance vehicle — a Ford F-250 with a diesel engine designed for hauling lawn equipment. Marcus didn't care about the original specs. It had an engine and wheels and a fuel tank. He'd been fixing things that moved for twenty years, and the end of the world was just another breakdown on the side of a long road.

He wasn't drinking. We all knew it the way we knew about Jim's health — noticed, not discussed. The anxiolytics from the pharmacy had bridged the withdrawal, and the bridge held. Now the bottle was gone and in its place was a wrench and a truck and the focused silence of a man who'd replaced one obsession with another and didn't care because the new one had a purpose.

He'd charged the phone the first night. Plugged it into a wall outlet in the dormitory hallway like it was the most ordinary act in the world, and when the screen lit up he'd stood there looking at it for a long time without saying anything. Ava's birthday photo. Purple frosting on her face, nine years old, laughing at whoever was holding the camera. He'd carried a dead phone for six weeks because putting it down would have meant putting her down, and now the screen was bright and her face was there and he could see her again and he stood in a hallway in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and looked at his daughter and didn't make a sound.

I know this because I walked past and saw him and kept walking. Some moments you don't interrupt. Some moments aren't yours.

**Caleb.** He was, remarkably, okay. Seven years old, orphaned, carried through a thousand Turned on a stranger's back, and he was drawing dinosaurs with crayons he'd found in a first-grade classroom in the education building and he was okay. Not undamaged — but okay the way children are okay when the adults around them are steady enough to build a floor. We were his floor. Dale's carvings, Marcus's stories, Jim's breathing lessons, Ruth's grammar corrections, Sienna's warmth, my presence — each of us a plank keeping Caleb above the water. He didn't know this. He didn't need to. He just needed to draw dinosaurs and hold the wooden beagle and fall asleep in someone's lap, and we provided these things because providing them was the only unambiguous good left in the world.

At dinner, Caleb asked if there was a playground on campus. "With swings," he specified. "And a slide. And can we play tag when we go outside?"

Sienna and I looked at each other. Not sadness — something closer to jealousy. His biggest problem was finding a place to play tag. Ours was calculating whether the emitter's range would hold through December. He was seven and his parents were gone and he still thought the future contained swings, and we were fifteen and seventeen and we'd stopped thinking the future contained anything at all, and of the two worldviews his was the one I wanted back.

**Sienna.** She was running.

Running laps around the campus track — the university's outdoor oval, four hundred meters, visible from the science building's second floor. I watched her from the window. She ran in the mornings, alone, controlled, her breathing measured. She ran the way she'd trained before — stride long, arms pumping, the biomechanics of a state-qualifier in the 400-meter. But different. Slower. More deliberate. She was testing her limits, finding the line between exertion and activation, reclaiming the thing the organism had tried to take from her.

I watched her run laps and I thought about the edge — the dissolving she'd described, the warmth, the invitation to stop being yourself. She was running toward it now, then turning back, then toward it again. Each lap a calibration, each recovery a data point. She was building a map of her own threshold the way I'd built a map of the Turned's behavior — by observation, by iteration, by the willingness to approach the dangerous thing and document what you found.

She caught me watching once. Looked up at the window. I didn't look away. She didn't wave. The not-waving said enough — that the watching and the running were connected, that we were both working on the same thing: staying human in a world that was making it more expensive every day.

**Me.** I was different and I didn't know how. I'd lost weight — fifteen pounds, maybe, the walk stripping the excess the way water strips loose soil. My face looked different in the bathroom mirror of the dormitory — sharper, older, the softness replaced by something that wasn't hardness exactly but was adjacent to it. I was talking more. Deciding more. Standing in rooms where people looked at me as if I had answers, and sometimes I did and sometimes I didn't and the gap between those two states was closing.

I was not a hero. I was a fifteen-year-old with a responsibility I didn't want and a grief I couldn't process, dealing with both the only way I knew how: writing them down and trying to figure out what they meant.

What I was not doing was sleeping.

This was the thing I hadn't expected. In the trailer, on the trail, in the churches and campsites and exposed ridgelines — I'd slept badly, but I'd slept. The body's emergency systems kept sleep shallow, cycling through the lightest stages, ready to wake at any sound. Adrenaline and cortisol made a poor sedative but an effective alarm system. I'd spent six weeks in a state of perpetual half-rest, never dropping deep enough to dream fully, the animal brain keeping one ear open for the thing that might kill us.

Behind the emitter, in a real bed with a real mattress and a locked door and the frequency humming in the walls like a mechanical lullaby, my body finally let go. And everything I'd suppressed came flooding in.

The first night at the university, I had the worst nightmare of my life. Not the defining one — that had already broken me on the road — but worse because it was *comprehensive.* Complete, vivid, architectural. The trailer and the hospital and the roadblock and the septic tank and the herd — all of it, stitched together, the emitter's hum woven through every scene like a soundtrack, and in every scene I was too slow, too late, too small, and the people I loved were standing behind glass I couldn't break.

I woke at 3 AM with my heart at 114 and my hand already on my pulse and the counting was automatic now — 114, 108, 104, 98, 92, 86 — the descent taking longer than it used to because the dreams went deeper than the waking fears ever had. On the trail, the nightmares had been compressed, fragmented, starved of oxygen by the same adrenaline that kept me alive. In safety, they had room to breathe. They expanded. They furnished themselves. They took their time.

The second night was worse. The third was worse than that. By the fourth night I understood the paradox: the safest place I'd been since Day One was producing the most dangerous sleep of my life. My body, finally permitted to rest, was processing six weeks of unprocessed horror in high-definition, and each dream sent my heart rate climbing toward the threshold I'd spent six weeks learning to avoid.

I started sleeping with the blood pressure cuff on. Sienna's idea — the cuff was the watch rotation reduced to a single wrist, the whole protocol of checking and worrying and sitting in the dark watching people breathe, compressed into a pink inflatable band and a digital threshold. It beeped at 120, a failsafe, a mechanical ceiling. Three nights out of five, the beep woke me. I'd lie in the dark with the cuff inflating on my arm and the emitter humming in the walls and I'd count — four in, hold, six out — until the numbers came down, and then I'd stare at the ceiling and not sleep, because not sleeping was safer than sleeping, which was the same conclusion I'd reached in the trailer on Day One and which turned out to be true in every setting, in every bed, in every version of safety the world could offer.

I was not the only one. Marcus's dormitory door was open every morning — he slept with it open now, the enclosed space too much, the need for an exit route stronger than the need for privacy. Dale carved at 2 AM some nights, the knife and the wood and the muscle memory the only things that worked when the recovery dreams came back. Ruth's light was on at all hours. Even Sienna — who slept better than any of us, the runner's body efficient at recovery — told me once, quietly, that she dreamed about the dissolving. The edge. The warmth. And that in the dream, she didn't turn back.

Safety, it turned out, was when the bill came due.

From the campus perimeter, through the binoculars, I studied the Turned. The rooted stood at the four-hundred-yard line — the edge of the emitter's effective range — in a ring that was visible from any elevated point on campus. Hundreds of them, grey-green and motionless, feet embedded in the soil, root networks threading between them in dark webs across the ground. The population of Fayetteville and the surrounding area, accumulated over six weeks, drawn by the same instincts that had drawn them to the river valley and the highway interchanges — and then rooted in place, becoming permanent infrastructure, the organism's colony expanding in a ring around the campus like a besieging forest.

But I noticed things. The hunters — the two percent, the mobile ones — weren't just carrying food to the rooted anymore. Some of them were testing the perimeter. Moving in, retreating, moving in again. Crouching. The posture I'd first seen in the garden woman on Day One and had named *hunting* in the committee meeting — directed, purposeful, food-motivated. The emitter pushed them back, but the pushback was weaker here, at the edge, and the hunger was stronger than the discomfort. Moss had said hunting was metabolically driven, not communicatively driven. The emitter jammed the collective signal. It didn't jam the stomach. One of them made the bark — that short, sharp call — and two others, fifty yards apart along the perimeter, oriented and converged. Three hunters at the frequency edge, testing, probing, the caloric need overriding the disruption. They retreated after a few minutes, shaking their heads like dogs coming out of water. But they'd been closer than yesterday. And the root network was creeping closer too — I could see new tendrils pushing into the bare zone where the frequency had once kept the soil clear, the organism's wired connections advancing ahead of its wireless ones. The emitter's declining curve and the organism's ascending network were converging, and the intersection point was roots at our walls.

The rooted themselves were changing. The oldest ones — the first-week Turned, six weeks out — were less recognizably human than they'd been when we arrived. Their bodies were thickening, the skin darkening further, the limbs losing definition as the organism's growth subsumed the original form. They were becoming something else. Not dying. Growing. The organism didn't need the human shape anymore. It needed the human brain — the neuron — and the roots — the dendrites. Everything else was raw material.

This wasn't hope. The trajectory was growth. The organism wasn't dying. It was building.

I stood at the perimeter and watched the Turned sway at their line and I thought about time. The emitter's declining curve and the organism's ascending one and where they'd intersect. The medications that would run out and the knowledge that wouldn't. The people behind me — on the track, under the hood, in the library, at the whiteboard — rebuilding something that didn't have a name yet. Something you build when the old world is gone and the new one hasn't started and all you have is your skills and your damage and your willingness to keep writing things down.

I went inside to prepare for the broadcast.

Over breakfast that morning — real eggs, scrambled, from the flock behind the greenhouse — Jim told me something.

The eggs deserve a sentence. The first real eggs in six weeks. Priya had been collecting them since before we arrived, but the combined flock — her seven hens plus our three highway refugees — was now producing enough for the whole group. Caleb collected them every morning. He carried them in a bowl lined with a dish towel, walking with the exaggerated care of a person transporting nitroglycerin, and presented them to Priya in the greenhouse kitchen with a formality that suggested he believed egg delivery was a military rank.

The rooster was the problem. It crowed at dawn — at the same dawn the Turned faced, the same sun they photosynthesized toward — with a volume I estimated at seventy decibels. Seventy decibels at the coop, roughly fifty at the perimeter, which was audible, which was a problem, because the rooted didn't care but the hunters did. Marcus had built a soundproofed coop from dorm mattress foam and plywood, and the rooster crowed inside it every morning in muffled outrage, and every morning Caleb went out to feed the flock and the rooster followed him around the greenhouse yard like an angry, feathered bodyguard, and the tactical implications of keeping a noisy animal inside a frequency perimeter were in constant tension with the fact that a seven-year-old boy had named the rooster Giganotosaurus and would not discuss alternatives.

Jim told me something. Casual. Smiling. The way Jim told everything, as if the telling were a gift he was handing you and the content were incidental to the giving.

"I had a dream last night," he said. Buttering toast. Not looking up. "A highway. Long, flat, one of those Texas ones that goes forever. A truck — a big rig, eighteen-wheeler — parked on the shoulder. And a little girl running toward it. Running fast, the way kids run when they see someone they love."

He took a bite of toast. Chewed. Swallowed.

"She was laughing," he said. "That's the part I remember. She was laughing and the sun was behind her and her shadow was longer than she was." He looked at me. The steady, luminous look. "It felt like a good dream. It felt like something that was going to happen."

Behind us, at the next table, Marcus went very still. His fork stopped halfway to his mouth. His face didn't change — the same flat, weathered expression he wore for everything — but his body went rigid in the way of a man who has just heard something impossible.

Ava was nine. She lived in Odessa, Texas. The highway Jim described was I-20 — the highway Marcus had driven ten thousand times, the highway that connected his routes to his daughter's birthday parties, the highway his phone had died on. Marcus had told no one about Ava except me, in a whisper, on a night when the dark was thick enough to hold a confession. Jim had never heard the name. Jim had never seen the photo on Marcus's phone. Jim had no way to know about a little girl in Texas or the highway that led to her.

Marcus set down his fork. He looked at Jim. Jim looked back. The look between them lasted three seconds and contained something I couldn't interpret and didn't try to.

"That's a good dream, Preacher," Marcus said. His voice was steady. His eyes were not.

Jim nodded. Went back to his toast. The morning continued. Nobody said anything else about it.

I wrote it in the journal. I underlined it twice. I had no interpretation — never had one for Jim's dreams. They operated somewhere my analytical brain couldn't reach, and his faith accepted them without needing them to make sense. Three dreams, now four. Water rising in a valley. A woman in a lab coat. A boy on a roof writing everything. A girl on a highway, laughing, running toward a truck.

Each one true. Each one impossible.

I underlined it a third time and turned the page.

Sienna found me in the hallway outside the radio room. I was sitting on the floor with the notebook open, reading my own handwriting, trying to figure out how to say the things I needed to say to people I couldn't see.

She sat down next to me. She'd been running — not the survival kind, the real kind. Moss had cleared a section of the track inside the emitter's perimeter and Sienna had been running it every morning, and the act of running without dying had done something for her that nothing else could. She was breathing hard and her skin was warm and she smelled like sweat and November air and the cheap soap from the university's emergency supplies.

She dropped two things in my lap. Vending machine candy bars — the fun-size kind, from a machine in the dormitory lobby that Marcus had pried open with a flathead screwdriver two days ago. The chocolate was grey with age. We did not care. They were candy bars. We'd eaten freeze-dried beef stew for six weeks and these were *candy bars.*

"I'm not sharing mine," she said. "You get your own."

"You literally just put it in my lap."

"That's your share. Don't look at mine." She was already unwrapping hers, breaking off a piece with the focused attention of a person performing surgery. We sat in the hallway eating bad chocolate and for thirty seconds the world was just two kids splitting a vending machine score and the apocalypse was someone else's problem.

"You ready?" she said, when the chocolate was gone.

"No."

"Good. Honest people live longer." Same thing she'd said on the morning we crossed Highway 21. A lifetime ago. Five weeks ago. Both.

"And don't use your customer service voice."

"I don't have a customer service voice."

"You do. It's the one where you sound like a Wikipedia article somebody read into a microphone. Use the other one. The one that sounds like a person."

She leaned her head against the wall. We sat in the hallway and didn't talk for a while. The hum of the emitter came through the floor. Somewhere downstairs, Caleb was laughing — an actual, genuine child's laugh, the first one I'd heard in weeks, and the sound of it went through me like sunlight through a window.

"Tell them about the Nesquik," she said.

"What?"

"The first night. In your trailer. The Nesquik and the canned milk. Tell them about that."

"Why would I tell them about that?"

"Because the people listening are alone. They've been alone for weeks. They're in their houses and their trailers and their basements and they haven't talked to anyone and they're running out of food and hope and they need to know that it's possible to sit in a kitchen with another person and drink something terrible and talk about your family and have it be — enough. Not a solution. Not a strategy. Just enough."

I looked at her. She looked at me. The hallway was empty and the emitter hummed and downstairs Caleb laughed again and Sienna's eyes were steady and certain and she was right, the way she was always right about the things that mattered, which were never the things I thought mattered.

"Okay," I said. "I'll tell them about the Nesquik."

# Chapter 29: The Broadcast

The radio room was on the third floor of the science building — a converted communications lab with a transmitter that Moss's engineering grad student had boosted to broadcast over fifty miles. Far enough to reach the river valley. Far enough to reach anyone still listening in the towns and homesteads and hiding places scattered across the Ozarks.

The microphone was a desktop model, silver, old. The kind they used for campus radio before the campus radio stopped. It sat on the desk in front of me like a small, attentive animal, waiting.

Moss was in the doorway. "The transmitter is live. You'll be on the frequency I've been using for the scientific bulletins. Anyone with a CB or shortwave will hear you."

"How many people is that?"

"I don't know. I've had contact with eleven survivor groups in the past three weeks. There could be more who listen and don't respond." She paused. "Say what you need to say. Don't worry about being right. Worry about being useful."

She left. The door closed. I was alone with the microphone and the notebook and the low hum of the emitter vibrating through the floor.

I opened the notebook. The pages were wrinkled and stained and the handwriting was mine — the handwriting of a person who'd started in a trailer and was finishing in a laboratory. Not the same person at both ends. I turned to the fresh page where I'd written what I wanted to say. I'd revised it four times. The fourth version was still wrong. That was the point.

I pressed the transmit button.

---

"This is Nate Carver. I'm fifteen years old. I'm broadcasting from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. I don't know what I'm doing. I want to start with that."

I told them. All of it. The rules — the mechanism, the threshold, the beta-blockers, the voices, the density, the frenzy. The things I'd learned by watching people die because they didn't have the information. I told them about fortification and why it kills you. I told them about the Turned getting smarter. I told them that the damage they carried — the addiction, the depression, the grief — was their skillset now, that managing a craving was the same mechanism as managing fear. I told them to write it down.

I read from the notebook. The entries I'd written in a trailer, in a church, on a trail, in a pulloff on a highway covered in blood. The wrong parts and the right parts and the parts I still couldn't classify. The journal was the survival tool — an honest record of the past, failures included, and the only map any of us had.

I told them the hardest thing last.

"I'm not going to tell you to come to Fayetteville. We have an emitter here that keeps the Turned back, but it won't last. The organism adapts. The range is already shrinking. What we have here isn't a fortress — it's a lab. A place where people are learning. And the learning is the thing that matters, not the walls or the frequency.

"So I'm going to keep broadcasting. Dr. Moss has data — medication protocols, frequency specifications, everything she's learned. I have the human part — the mistakes, the lessons that don't fit in a lab report. Between us, we'll give you what we can. What you do with it is yours.

"Stay calm. Stay small. Stay quiet. Write it down.

"This is Nate Carver. I'm fifteen. I survived. Not because I was brave. Because I was slow, and scared, and I paid attention.

"I'll be here tomorrow. Same frequency. Same time.

"Stay alive."

---

I released the transmit button. The microphone sat on the desk, silver and quiet. The hum of the emitter filled the room.

I sat there for a while. My hands were shaking — not fear this time. The kind that comes after you've done something irreversible and the adrenaline is turning into something between relief and terror.

Through the window, the campus was quiet in the early evening light. The track, empty — Sienna had finished her laps. Caleb's drawings taped to a bulletin board on the quad. Marcus's wrench audible even from the third floor.

The CB on the desk crackled. Static. Then a voice — distant, broken, a man's voice from somewhere south, maybe thirty miles out, maybe more:

"— heard you. We heard you. There are twelve of us. We have a pharmacy. We didn't know about the beta-blockers. We're —"

Static swallowed the rest. But the voice had been there. Someone had heard.

I picked up the microphone.

"This is Nate Carver. I hear you. Tell me your location. Tell me what you need. I'm listening."

# Chapter 30: The Journal

Day 45.

I sat on the roof of the science building at dusk. The frequency emitter hummed behind me — its speakers and antenna array mounted on the parapet, the sound so constant it had become the texture of the air. You didn't get used to it. You learned to carry it.

The campus spread below me in the last light. The quad, the dormitories, the track, the maintenance bay. The buildings were brick and limestone and they glowed in the dusk the way old buildings glow — warm, patient, as if they'd been waiting for someone to use them again.

Below, in the quad, Sienna was running laps. Controlled. Steady. Her breathing measured, her stride long, the mechanics of a body reclaiming itself from the thing that had tried to take it. She ran toward the edge and turned back. Toward and back. Each lap she pushed closer to the edge and came back, and the margin in her favor was growing.

Caleb was on the steps of the education building with Jim. They were counting breaths. Four in. Hold. Six out. Caleb's small chest rising and falling with the careful concentration of a child who trusted the man beside him. Jim's hand was on the boy's shoulder. His other hand was on the railing, supporting weight he used to carry unassisted. He didn't let Caleb see this. Caleb saw anyway. Children see everything. They just don't always say.

Marcus was under the hood of the truck. The wrench was steady, rhythmic. For the first time in years, he was building something instead of enduring something. The truck might run someday. It might not. 

Ruth was in the library. I couldn't see her from the roof but I knew she was there because the library lights were on and Ruth's schedule was as predictable as her grammar: mornings for reading, afternoons for the project she wouldn't describe, evenings for telling everyone their syntax was deteriorating. The standards persisted. Civilization was negotiable. Subject-verb agreement was not.

Dale was on the bench outside the science building, carving. The zoo had grown — beagle, cardinal, fox, turtle, owl, and now something new, something I couldn't identify from the roof but which Dale would later tell me was a dome. A geodesic dome, like the ones Buckminster Fuller designed. "Strongest structure in nature," he said. "All the force distributed evenly. Nothing carries more than its share." He'd carved it for Caleb. Caleb put it in the center of the zoo and called it the animals' house.

Maria was at the whiteboard in the cafeteria, updating the supply calendar. She would always be at the whiteboard. The counting was her prayer, the way Jim's prayer was his practice, the way Dale's carving was his meeting. Same discipline, different doors.

Beyond the perimeter, four hundred yards out, the rooted held their line. A dark forest of grey-green figures at the edge of the frequency's reach, motionless, connected, the root network threading between them like the wiring of a vast and patient brain. Not swaying anymore — growing. The colony watched the campus with the patience of something that was already everywhere and had nothing but time.

The rooted were there. We were here. The hum between us was the world as it was. Four hundred yards and shrinking — that was the space where everything that mattered would happen.

I opened the notebook to the last page. I'd found a new one — a composition book from the campus bookstore, black and white marbled cover, the kind I'd used in school a lifetime ago. The old notebook sat beside me, wrinkled and stained, its pages full. The new one was blank. Both of them were mine.

I picked up the pen.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #21:**

*I survived. Not because I was brave or strong or smart. I survived because I was slow, and I was scared, and I paid attention. That's not a hero's story. The world doesn't need hero stories anymore. It needs notes.*

*Here are my notes.*

*I'm going to keep writing them until I run out of things to learn or until I turn, and I don't plan on doing either.*

*Tomorrow we're going to try to reach the group south of here — the twelve survivors who responded to the broadcast. Dr. Moss says there might be a whole network. Sienna says she's coming. Marcus is fixing the truck. Jim says he'll pray for us, which I think means his heart is getting worse and he's not telling anyone, and I think means he knows I know, and I think means we're both carrying that knowledge and neither of us is ready to set it down.*

*Dale is teaching recovery workshops to people who never thought they'd need recovery skills. Ruth is building something in the library that she won't describe. Maria is counting, always counting, because counting is how she loves us. Caleb has a wooden geodesic dome for his animal zoo and he says the animals live there because it's the safest shape. He's seven and he's right.*

*I miss my mom. I'm going to miss her for the rest of my life. However long that is.*

*She used to say "Happy Friday" every week when she left for her shift. I used to barely look up from my screen. I'd give anything to not look up from my screen one more time.*

*But I'm still here. We're still here. And tomorrow we walk again.*

---

I closed the journal. The new notebook, first entry, the ink still drying.

Below, Sienna finished her laps. She looked up at the roof. I looked down. Four stories and six weeks and everything that had happened between us.

She waved.

I waved back.

Then I went downstairs to help Marcus with the truck. I didn't know anything about trucks. I'd learn.
