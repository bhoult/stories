# Chapter 28: Inventory

Day 43. I took inventory.

Not of supplies — Moss had those catalogued with a precision that made Maria's pantry look casual. The campus pharmacy basement held months of medications. The cafeteria stores, supplemented by the campus greenhouse that a botany grad student had been maintaining, provided adequate if monotonous calories. Water came from the campus wells. Power came from the solar array, most of it consumed by the emitter. The infrastructure was fragile but functional. The supplies were not the thing I needed to count.

I needed to count us.

---

**Jim.** He was in decline and pretending he wasn't. The walk had taken something from him — not just the physical toll of sixty miles at seventy years old, but something deeper, a depletion of the reserves that had kept him upright through six weeks of being the person everyone leaned on. His color was off. His breathing was heavier than it had been. He'd started sitting more and standing less, and when he stood he put his hand on things — tables, door frames, the back of a chair — in the way of a man whose balance was negotiating with his body.

He didn't talk about it. He led prayers. He made coffee from the campus supply — real coffee, not instant, the first real coffee in six weeks, and the smell of it in the morning was a sacrament. He sat with Caleb on the steps of the science building and taught the boy to count his breaths, and Caleb counted — four in, hold, six out — with the careful concentration of a child who didn't fully understand why he was counting but trusted the person teaching him.

I watched Jim the way I watched everything. I noticed the hand on the door frame. I didn't say anything. Some observations are too expensive to share.

**Ruth.** Stable. Fragile. Her atenolol was resupplied and her blood pressure was managed and her knees were the same knees they'd been before the walk, which is to say they ground and ached and she walked on them anyway because Ruth Fenn had been walking on inadequate knees for twenty years and the end of the world was not going to change her policy.

She'd found the campus library. This was, for Ruth, the equivalent of Marcus finding a functioning truck. She spent hours in the stacks — pulling books, reading, making notes in margins with a pencil she'd taken from the reference desk. She was cataloguing. I didn't ask what — Ruth's projects revealed themselves on her schedule, not on mine.

"The grammar in these biology textbooks is atrocious," she reported at dinner one night. "Split infinitives on every page. And the passive voice — 'it was observed that the specimen was affected by' — who observed? Who was affected? Science is no excuse for imprecision."

"You're copyediting biology textbooks at the end of the world," Sienna said.

"Someone has to maintain standards. Civilization may be collapsing but subject-verb agreement need not collapse with it."

**Dale and Maria.** They were rebuilding. Not the marriage — the marriage had survived six years of addiction and twelve of recovery and six weeks of apocalypse, and whatever architecture remained was load-bearing and didn't need reconstruction. They were rebuilding routine. Dale carved in the mornings, taught recovery workshops in the afternoons — Moss's grad students attended, and Howard the janitor, who turned out to have twenty years of AA behind his mopping — and sat with Maria in the evenings while she organized whatever system she'd adopted that day.

Dale hadn't had a craving in two weeks. He found this suspicious.

"The craving always comes back," he said, carving a new animal — an owl, the eyes emerging from the cedar with the precision of a man whose steady hands were still novel enough to appreciate. "That's what recovery teaches you. The craving is dormant, not dead. It's waiting."

"Maybe this time it's different."

"It's never different. The context changes. The craving doesn't." He blew dust from the owl's face. "But the skills don't change either. When it comes back, I'll know what to do. Five minutes at a time."

Maria, beside him, was building a supply calendar on a whiteboard she'd requisitioned from a classroom. Dates, quantities, consumption rates, projected shortfalls. The campus's resources mapped as a timeline. She'd added a column for the emitter's declining effectiveness, the data from Moss's observations charted as a descending curve.

"We have approximately three months at current consumption," she said. "Assuming the emitter holds, which it won't, and assuming no additional survivors arrive, which they will."

"Maria, can we have one day without a countdown?"

"No. Countdowns are how we stay alive. If the Lyles had maintained a countdown, they'd have known when to leave." She looked at Dale. "I'll stop counting when there's nothing left to count."

**Marcus.** He was under the hood of a truck. A campus maintenance vehicle — a Ford F-250 with a diesel engine and a suspension that had been designed for hauling lawn equipment, not for post-apocalyptic transportation, but Marcus didn't care about the original design specifications. He cared that it had an engine and wheels and a fuel tank, and he was going to make it run because Marcus Webb fixed things that moved and had been fixing them for twenty years and the end of the world was just another breakdown on the side of a long road.

He wasn't drinking. This fact existed in the group's awareness the way Jim's declining health existed — noticed, not discussed. The anxiolytics from the pharmacy had bridged the withdrawal, and the bridge had held, and now Marcus was on the other side and the bottle was gone and in its place was a wrench and a truck and the focused, attentive silence of a man who had replaced one obsession with another and knew it and didn't care because the new obsession had a purpose.

His daughter Ava's birthday photo was still on the dead phone in his pocket. I'd seen him take it out at night, in the dark, holding the blank screen as if the image were still visible. Maybe, to him, it was.

**Caleb.** He was, remarkably, okay. Seven years old, orphaned, carried through a thousand Turned on a stranger's back, and he was drawing dinosaurs with crayons he'd found in a first-grade classroom in the education building and he was okay. Not undamaged — not unaffected — but okay in the way that children are okay when the adults around them are steady enough to build a floor. We were his floor. Dale's carvings, Marcus's stories, Jim's breathing lessons, Ruth's grammar corrections, Sienna's warmth, my presence — each of us a plank in the surface that kept Caleb above the water. He didn't know this. He didn't need to. He just needed to draw dinosaurs and hold the wooden beagle and fall asleep in someone's lap, and we provided these things because providing them was the only unambiguous good left in the world.

**Sienna.** She was running.

Not away. Not toward. Running laps around the campus track — the university's outdoor oval, four hundred meters, visible from the science building's second floor. I watched her from the window. She ran in the mornings, alone, controlled, her breathing measured. She ran the way she'd trained before — stride long, arms pumping, the biomechanics of a state-qualifier in the 400-meter. But different. Slower. More deliberate. She was testing her limits, finding the line between exertion and activation, reclaiming the thing the organism had tried to take from her.

I watched her run laps and I thought about the edge — the dissolving she'd described, the warmth, the invitation to stop being yourself. She was running toward it now. Not past it. Toward it, and then turning back, and then toward it again, each lap a calibration, each recovery a data point. She was building a map of her own threshold the way I'd built a map of the Turned's behavior — by observation, by iteration, by the willingness to approach the dangerous thing and document what you found.

She caught me watching once. Looked up at the window. I didn't look away. She didn't wave. The not-waving was its own kind of communication — an acknowledgment that the watching and the running were connected, that my observation and her movement were two halves of the same project, and that the project was staying human in a world that was making it increasingly expensive.

**Me.** I was different and I didn't know how. I'd lost weight — fifteen pounds, maybe, the walk stripping the excess the way water strips loose soil. My face looked different in the bathroom mirror of the dormitory — sharper, older, the softness replaced by something that wasn't hardness exactly but was adjacent to it. I was talking more. Deciding more. Standing in rooms where people looked at me as if I had answers, and sometimes I did and sometimes I didn't and the gap between those two states was closing.

I was not a hero. I was a fifteen-year-old who had been given a responsibility he didn't want and a grief he couldn't process and who was dealing with both the only way he knew how: by writing them down and trying to figure out what they meant.

What I was not doing was sleeping.

This was the thing I hadn't expected. In the trailer, on the trail, in the churches and campsites and exposed ridgelines — I'd slept badly, but I'd slept. The body's emergency systems kept sleep shallow, cycling through the lightest stages, ready to wake at any sound. Adrenaline and cortisol made a poor sedative but an effective alarm system. I'd spent six weeks in a state of perpetual half-rest, never dropping deep enough to dream fully, the animal brain keeping one ear open for the thing that might kill us.

Behind the emitter, in a real bed with a real mattress and a locked door and the frequency humming in the walls like a mechanical lullaby, my body finally let go. And everything I'd suppressed came flooding in.

The first night at the university, I had the worst nightmare of my life. Not the defining one — that had already broken me on the road — but something worse because it was *comprehensive.* The dreams weren't fragments anymore. They were complete, vivid, architectural. The trailer and the hospital and the overpass and the septic tank and the herd — all of it, stitched together, the emitter's hum woven through every scene like a soundtrack, and in every scene I was too slow, too late, too small, and the people I loved were standing behind glass I couldn't break.

I woke at 3 AM with my heart at 114 and my hand already on my pulse and the counting was automatic now — 114, 108, 104, 98, 92, 86 — the descent taking longer than it used to because the dreams went deeper than the waking fears ever had. On the trail, the nightmares had been compressed, fragmented, starved of oxygen by the same adrenaline that kept me alive. In safety, they had room to breathe. They expanded. They furnished themselves. They took their time.

The second night was worse. The third was worse than that. By the fourth night I understood the paradox: the safest place I'd been since Day One was producing the most dangerous sleep of my life. My body, finally permitted to rest, was processing six weeks of unprocessed horror in high-definition, and each dream sent my heart rate climbing toward the threshold I'd spent six weeks learning to avoid.

I started sleeping with the blood pressure cuff on. Sienna's idea — the cuff was the watch rotation reduced to a single wrist, the whole protocol of checking and worrying and sitting in the dark watching people breathe, compressed into a pink inflatable band and a digital threshold. It beeped at 120, a failsafe, a mechanical ceiling. Three nights out of five, the beep woke me. I'd lie in the dark with the cuff inflating on my arm and the emitter humming in the walls and I'd count — four in, hold, six out — until the numbers came down, and then I'd stare at the ceiling and not sleep, because not sleeping was safer than sleeping, which was the same conclusion I'd reached in the trailer on Day One and which turned out to be true in every setting, in every bed, in every version of safety the world could offer.

I was not the only one. Marcus's dormitory door was open every morning — he slept with it open now, the enclosed space too much, the need for an exit route stronger than the need for privacy. Dale carved at 2 AM some nights, the knife and the wood and the muscle memory the only things that worked when the recovery dreams came back. Ruth's light was on at all hours. Even Sienna — who slept better than any of us, the runner's body efficient at recovery — told me once, quietly, that she dreamed about the dissolving. The edge. The warmth. And that in the dream, she didn't turn back.

Safety, it turned out, was when the bill came due.

---

From the campus perimeter, through the binoculars, I studied the Turned. They stood at the four-hundred-yard line — the edge of the emitter's effective range — in a ring that was visible from any elevated point on campus. Hundreds of them. The population of Fayetteville and the surrounding area, accumulated over six weeks, drawn by the same instincts that had drawn them to the river valley and the highway interchanges: human infrastructure, water, the gravitational pull of the built environment.

But I noticed things. Some of the older Turned — the hungry ones, gaunt, weeks out from their last real meal — weren't standing passively at the four-hundred-yard line. They were testing it. Moving in, retreating, moving in again. Crouching. The posture I'd first seen in the garden woman on Day One and had named *hunting* in the committee meeting — directed, purposeful, food-motivated. The emitter pushed them back, but the pushback was weaker here, at the edge, and the hunger was stronger than the discomfort. Moss had said hunting was metabolically driven, not communicatively driven. The emitter jammed the collective signal. It didn't jam the stomach. One of them made the bark — that short, sharp call — and two others, fifty yards apart along the perimeter, oriented and converged. Three hunters at the frequency edge, testing, probing, the caloric need overriding the disruption. They retreated after a few minutes, shaking their heads like dogs coming out of water. But they'd been closer than yesterday. The emitter's declining curve and the organism's ascending hunger were converging, and the intersection point was hunting at our walls.

The oldest ones — the first-week Turned, six weeks out — were also deteriorating. Moving slower. Listing. Their skin was damaged — sunburns untreated, wounds unhealed, the accumulated wear of six weeks of continuous exposure without shelter, without medicine, without the maintenance that human bodies require. The organism sustained them beyond what an untreated body should endure. But it couldn't sustain them forever. The biology was mortal even if the organism was not.

They were dying. Slowly. Not fast enough to matter this month or next. But the trajectory was there, visible in the data if you were patient enough to plot it.

This was, in its grim way, hope. Not the kind of hope you put on a poster. The kind you put on a graph — a declining curve, years long, that said: time is on your side, if you can survive long enough for time to work.

I stood at the perimeter and watched the Turned sway at their line and I thought about time. About the emitter's declining curve and the organism's ascending one and the intersection point where the first would fail and the second would arrive. About the medications that would run out and the knowledge that wouldn't. About the people behind me — on the track, under the hood, in the library, at the whiteboard — who were rebuilding something that didn't have a name yet but was the thing you built when the old world was gone and the new one hadn't started and you were standing in the gap between them with nothing but your skills and your damage and your willingness to keep writing things down.

I went inside to prepare for the broadcast.

Over breakfast that morning — real eggs, from chickens the botany grad student kept behind the greenhouse, the first real eggs in six weeks — Jim told me something. Casual. Smiling. The way Jim told everything, as if the telling were a gift he was handing you and the content were incidental to the giving.

"I had a dream last night," he said. Buttering toast. Not looking up. "A highway. Long, flat, one of those Texas ones that goes forever. A truck — a big rig, eighteen-wheeler — parked on the shoulder. And a little girl running toward it. Running fast, the way kids run when they see someone they love."

He took a bite of toast. Chewed. Swallowed.

"She was laughing," he said. "That's the part I remember. She was laughing and the sun was behind her and her shadow was longer than she was." He looked at me. The steady, luminous look. "It felt like a good dream. It felt like something that was going to happen."

Behind us, at the next table, Marcus went very still. His fork stopped halfway to his mouth. His face didn't change — the same flat, weathered expression he wore for everything — but his body went rigid in the way of a man who has just heard something impossible.

Ava was nine. She lived in Odessa, Texas. The highway Jim described was I-20 — the highway Marcus had driven ten thousand times, the highway that connected his routes to his daughter's birthday parties, the highway his phone had died on. Marcus had told no one about Ava except me, in a whisper, on a night when the dark was thick enough to hold a confession. Jim had never heard the name. Jim had never seen the photo on the dead phone. Jim had no way to know about a little girl in Texas or the highway that led to her.

Marcus set down his fork. He looked at Jim. Jim looked back. The look between them lasted three seconds and contained something I couldn't interpret and didn't try to.

"That's a good dream, Preacher," Marcus said. His voice was steady. His eyes were not.

Jim nodded. Went back to his toast. The morning continued. Nobody said anything else about it.

I wrote it in the journal. I underlined it twice. I wrote no interpretation, because I had none, because I had never had any interpretation for Jim's dreams, because the dreams operated in a register that my analytical machinery couldn't reach and that Jim's faith accepted without requiring it to make sense. Three dreams, now four. Water rising in a valley. A woman in a lab coat. A boy on a roof writing everything. A girl on a highway, laughing, running toward a truck.

Each one true. Each one impossible.

I underlined it a third time and turned the page.

---

Sienna found me in the hallway outside the radio room. I was sitting on the floor with the notebook open, reading my own handwriting, trying to figure out how to say the things I needed to say to people I couldn't see.

She sat down next to me. She'd been running — not the survival kind, the real kind. Moss had cleared a section of the track inside the emitter's perimeter and Sienna had been running it every morning, and the act of running without dying had done something for her that nothing else could. She was breathing hard and her skin was warm and she smelled like sweat and November air and the cheap soap from the university's emergency supplies.

"You ready?" she said.

"No."

"Good. Honest people live longer." Same thing she'd said on the morning we crossed Highway 21. A lifetime ago. Five weeks ago. Both.

She leaned her head against the wall. We sat in the hallway and didn't talk for a while. The hum of the emitter came through the floor. Somewhere downstairs, Caleb was laughing — an actual, genuine child's laugh, the first one I'd heard in weeks, and the sound of it went through me like sunlight through a window.

"Tell them about the Nesquik," she said.

"What?"

"The first night. In your trailer. The Nesquik and the canned milk. Tell them about that."

"Why would I tell them about that?"

"Because the people listening are alone. They've been alone for weeks. They're in their houses and their trailers and their basements and they haven't talked to anyone and they're running out of food and hope and they need to know that it's possible to sit in a kitchen with another person and drink something terrible and talk about your family and have it be — enough. Not a solution. Not a strategy. Just enough."

I looked at her. She looked at me. The hallway was empty and the emitter hummed and downstairs Caleb laughed again and Sienna's eyes were steady and certain and she was right, the way she was always right about the things that mattered, which were never the things I thought mattered.

"Okay," I said. "I'll tell them about the Nesquik."

# Chapter 29: The Broadcast

The radio room was on the third floor of the science building — a converted communications lab with a transmitter that Moss's engineering grad student had boosted to broadcast over fifty miles. Far enough to reach the river valley. Far enough to reach anyone still listening in the towns and homesteads and hiding places scattered across the Ozarks.

The microphone was a desktop model, silver, old. The kind they used for campus radio before the campus radio stopped. It sat on the desk in front of me like a small, attentive animal, waiting.

Moss was in the doorway. "The transmitter is live. You'll be on the frequency I've been using for the scientific bulletins. Anyone with a CB or shortwave will hear you."

"How many people is that?"

"I don't know. I've had contact with eleven survivor groups in the past three weeks. There could be more who listen and don't respond." She paused. "Say what you need to say. Don't worry about being right. Worry about being useful."

She left. The door closed. I was alone with the microphone and the notebook and the low hum of the emitter vibrating through the floor.

I opened the notebook. The pages were wrinkled and stained and the handwriting was mine — the handwriting of a person who'd started writing in a trailer and was finishing in a laboratory, and who was not the same person at both ends of the notebook. I turned to the fresh page where I'd written what I wanted to say. I'd revised it four times. The fourth version was still wrong. All versions would be wrong. The wrongness was the point.

I pressed the transmit button.

---

"This is Nate Carver. I'm fifteen years old. I'm broadcasting from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, where Dr. Eleanor Moss has been coordinating survivor research and operating a frequency emitter that keeps the Turned at a distance.

"I don't know what I'm doing. I want to start with that because everything I'm about to tell you was learned by accident, by failure, and by watching people die because they didn't have the information I'm going to give you now. I'm not a scientist. I'm not a doctor. I'm not a soldier. I'm a kid who was sitting in a trailer when the world ended and who survived because I paid attention and wrote things down and got lucky in ways I don't deserve.

"Here is what I've learned. I'm going to tell you all of it, including the parts I got wrong, because the wrong parts are how I got to the right parts, and you'll need the process as much as the conclusions.

"Rule one: the thing that turns people isn't a bite. It isn't a virus. It isn't transmitted by contact. It's fear. The organism — the thing that's doing this — feeds on the human stress response. Specifically, it activates when your adrenaline and cortisol cross a threshold and stay there for roughly two minutes. If you can keep your heart rate below that threshold, the organism can't convert you.

"I know that sounds useless. I know 'stay calm' is the worst advice anyone can give in a crisis. But it's not advice — it's a mechanism. It's how the thing works. And once you understand how it works, you can work with the mechanism instead of against it.

"Rule two: beta-blockers save lives. Metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol — the medications that suppress your sympathetic nervous system. They lower your heart rate, they dampen your adrenaline response, and they make it physically harder for the organism to trigger conversion. If you can find a pharmacy, the beta-blockers will still be on the shelves. Nobody looted them because nobody knew.

"The narcotics will be gone. The antibiotics will be gone. The things people grabbed are the things people knew they needed. The things you actually need are dusty and untouched and they have names you can't pronounce. Look for bottles that say 'metoprolol tartrate' or 'atenolol' or 'propranolol hydrochloride.' Take them. They are more important than food.

"Rule three: the Turned are coordinated. They're not mindless — they're networked. The organism connects them into a collective that can herd, surround, and overwhelm. Small groups are patient. They'll wait outside your door and use voices you recognize — people you loved, people you trusted — to try to draw you out. This is the hardest thing to hear and the most important: the voices are real memories, used as weapons. The person you hear is not the person speaking.

"Rule four: fortification kills you. I know this contradicts everything you believe. I know the instinct is to build walls and bar doors and arm yourself and dig in. But every act of fortification generates noise and activity that attracts more Turned. Every Turned that arrives increases the density. When the density crosses a threshold — I don't have a reliable number, it depends on the space — the coordinated behavior collapses into a frenzy that tears through walls. I watched it happen. The people who fortified died because the fortification attracted the thing that killed them.

"Stay small. Stay quiet. Move before the density builds.

"Rule five: the Turned are getting smarter. The organism adapts. Week one, they were clumsy. Week six, they patrol, they forage, they check doors. The coordination tightens. The behaviors become more efficient. Whatever you're doing that works now will work less well next month. You have to adapt faster than the organism does. This is the arms race. This is the thing that will define everything going forward.

"Rule six: your damage is your skillset. The things that went wrong in your life — addiction, depression, anxiety, grief — taught you skills you don't know you have. Managing a craving is the same mechanism as managing fear. Living with depression gives you a chemical baseline that the organism reads as calm. The worst things that happened to you may be the reason you survive. I'm not saying this to comfort you. I'm saying it because I've watched it happen. The people in my group who are best at surviving are the ones who learned to manage their own chemistry before the world required it.

"Rule seven: you will make mistakes. You will make decisions that get people hurt. You will watch people die and not be able to help. You will do the wrong thing, and the wrong thing will teach you the right thing, and the right thing will cost something you can't afford, and you'll pay it because the alternative is not learning, and not learning is how you die.

"Write it down. Whatever you learn, whatever you get wrong, write it down. The journal is the survival tool. Not because it predicts the future but because it records the past, and the past — honestly recorded, including the failures — is the only map we have.

"One more thing. I spent the first four weeks telling myself I was just a kid. Fifteen, overweight, no training, no skills — I had a whole list, and every item on it was accurate, and every item was a reason I couldn't be expected to do anything. It was the most comfortable thought I had. It was also the most dangerous one.

"Because if nothing is your fault — if you're just a fat kid who got unlucky — then you're powerless. You can't fix what isn't yours. You can't improve what you won't own. Someone I trust told me that the best-case scenario is that everything that goes wrong is your responsibility. Not your *fault* — your responsibility. Because responsibility is the same thing as power. It means you can change it.

"I'm slow. That's not a confession — it's a logistics problem, and logistics problems have solutions. I'm scared. That's not a weakness — it's data about a mechanism I now understand better than most people alive. Every true thing about yourself is either a wall you hide behind or a constraint you build a strategy around. The facts don't change. What you do with them is the only thing that ever changes.

"I'm going to keep broadcasting. Dr. Moss has data — scientific data, medication protocols, the frequency specifications for the emitter that keeps the Turned back. She'll share it. I'll share what I have — the human part, the mistakes, the lessons that don't fit in a lab report.

"If you're hearing this, you've survived six weeks. That means you've already done the hardest part. You've already learned more than you know. You've already adapted in ways you haven't recognized yet.

"Stay calm. Stay small. Stay quiet. Write it down.

"And if you can — if you have the resources and the route and the courage — come to Fayetteville. We're building something here. I don't know what to call it yet. It's not a fortress. It's not a government. It's a place where people are learning, together, how to live in a world that changed, and the learning is the thing that matters more than the walls or the weapons or the frequency.

"This is Nate Carver. I'm fifteen. I survived. Not because I was brave. Because I was slow, and scared, and I paid attention.

"I'll be here tomorrow. Same frequency. Same time.

"Stay alive."

---

I released the transmit button. The microphone sat on the desk, silver and quiet. The hum of the emitter filled the room.

I sat there for a while. My hands were shaking — not the fear-shaking, the other kind, the kind that comes after you've done something irreversible and the adrenaline is metabolizing into something that isn't quite relief and isn't quite terror but lives in the space between them.

Through the window, the campus was quiet in the early evening light. The track was visible — empty now, Sienna had finished her laps. The quad, where Caleb's drawings were taped to a bulletin board outside the education building. The maintenance bay, where Marcus's wrench was audible even from the third floor.

The CB on the desk crackled. Static. Then a voice — distant, broken, a man's voice from somewhere south, maybe thirty miles out, maybe more:

"— heard you. We heard you. There are twelve of us. We have a pharmacy. We didn't know about the beta-blockers. We're —"

Static swallowed the rest. But the voice had been there. Someone had heard.

I picked up the microphone.

"This is Nate Carver. I hear you. Tell me your location. Tell me what you need. I'm listening."

# Chapter 30: The Journal

Day 45.

I sat on the roof of the science building at dusk. The frequency emitter hummed behind me — its speakers and antenna array mounted on the parapet, the sound so constant now that it had become the texture of the air, not a noise but a condition, the thing the world sounded like. You didn't get used to it. You learned to carry it.

The campus spread below me in the last light. The quad, the dormitories, the track, the maintenance bay. The buildings were brick and limestone and they glowed in the dusk the way old buildings glow — warm, patient, as if they'd been waiting for someone to use them again.

Below, in the quad, Sienna was running laps. Controlled. Steady. Her breathing measured, her stride long, the mechanics of a body reclaiming itself from the thing that had tried to take it. She ran toward the edge and turned back. Toward and back. Each lap a negotiation between who she was and what the world demanded, and each negotiation ending in her favor by a margin that was growing.

Caleb was on the steps of the education building with Jim. They were counting breaths. Four in. Hold. Six out. Caleb's small chest rising and falling with the careful concentration of a child who trusted the man beside him. Jim's hand was on the boy's shoulder. His other hand was on the railing, supporting weight he used to carry unassisted. He didn't let Caleb see this. Caleb saw anyway. Children see everything. They just don't always say.

Marcus was under the hood of the truck. The wrench sound was steady, rhythmic — the sound of a man who had replaced one compulsion with another and who was, for the first time in years, building something instead of enduring something. The truck might run someday. It might not. The building was the point.

Ruth was in the library. I couldn't see her from the roof but I knew she was there because the library lights were on and Ruth's schedule was as predictable as her grammar: mornings for reading, afternoons for the project she wouldn't describe, evenings for telling everyone their syntax was deteriorating. The standards persisted. Civilization was negotiable. Subject-verb agreement was not.

Dale was on the bench outside the science building, carving. The zoo had grown — beagle, cardinal, fox, turtle, owl, and now something new, something I couldn't identify from the roof but which Dale would later tell me was a dome. A geodesic dome, like the ones Buckminster Fuller designed. "Strongest structure in nature," he said. "All the force distributed evenly. Nothing carries more than its share." He'd carved it for Caleb. Caleb put it in the center of the zoo and called it the animals' house.

Maria was at the whiteboard in the cafeteria, updating the supply calendar. She would always be at the whiteboard. The counting was her prayer, the same way Jim's prayer was his practice, the same way Dale's carving was his meeting. Everyone arrived at the same discipline through different doors. The discipline was the same. The doors didn't matter.

Beyond the perimeter, four hundred yards out, the Turned held their line. A dark presence at the edge of the frequency's reach, swaying, watching, the collective intelligence observing the campus with the patient attention of something that had time. They were there. They would always be there — until the emitter failed, or the organism adapted, or time did what time does to mortal bodies, or something changed that none of us could predict.

The Turned were there. We were here. The hum between us was the sound of the world as it was, not as we wanted it to be, and the distance between those two things was the space in which everything that mattered would happen.

I opened the notebook to the last page. I'd found a new one — a composition book from the campus bookstore, black and white marbled cover, the kind I'd used in school a lifetime ago. The old notebook sat beside me, wrinkled and stained, its pages full. The new one was blank. Both of them were mine.

I picked up the pen.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #21:**

*I survived. Not because I was brave or strong or smart. I survived because I was slow, and I was scared, and I paid attention. That's not a hero's story. I don't think the world needs hero stories anymore. I think it needs notes.*

*Here are my notes.*

*I'm going to keep writing them until I run out of things to learn or until I turn, and I don't plan on doing either.*

*Tomorrow we're going to try to reach the group south of here — the twelve survivors who responded to the broadcast. Dr. Moss says there might be a whole network. Sienna says she's coming. Marcus is fixing the truck. Jim says he'll pray for us, which I think means his heart is getting worse and he's not telling anyone, and I think means he knows I know, and I think means we're both carrying that knowledge and neither of us is ready to set it down.*

*Dale is teaching recovery workshops to people who never thought they'd need recovery skills. Ruth is building something in the library that she won't describe. Maria is counting, always counting, because counting is how she loves us. Caleb has a wooden geodesic dome for his animal zoo and he says the animals live there because it's the safest shape. He's seven and he's right.*

*I miss my mom. I'm going to miss her for the rest of my life. However long that is.*

*She used to say "Happy Friday" every week when she left for her shift. I used to barely look up from my screen. I'd give anything to not look up from my screen one more time.*

*But I'm still here. We're still here. And tomorrow we walk again.*

I closed the journal. The new notebook, first entry, the ink still drying.

Below, Sienna finished her laps. She looked up at the roof. I looked down. The distance between us was four stories and six weeks and everything that had happened and the not-waving that was its own kind of conversation.

She waved.

I waved back.

Then I went downstairs to help Marcus with the truck. I didn't know anything about trucks. I was going to learn.
