# Chapter 13: The Pharmacy Run

On Day 15, we walked to the pharmacy.

I want to describe this honestly, which means I need to tell you what a supply run looks like when the supplies you need aren't weapons or ammunition but pills that suppress your ability to be afraid. In every movie, in every game, the supply run is a set piece — tactical gear, loaded weapons, a van with the engine running. Somebody says "let's move" and music plays and people do cool things under pressure. This was not that.

This was four people sitting in a church basement for two hours arguing about breathing.

"In through the nose," Jim said. "Four counts. Hold four. Out through the mouth, six counts. Feel the exhale longer than the inhale — that's the vagal brake, it downshifts the sympathetic nervous system."

"You learned that in Vietnam?" Marcus asked.

"I learned it from a counselor at the VA in 1978. She called it 'combat breathing.' I called it prayer with a timer. It's the same thing."

"It's not the same thing."

"Marcus, if it produces the same result, it's the same thing. We've been over this."

They'd been over it. This argument — the mechanism of calm, whether it mattered why something worked or only that it worked — ran underneath every conversation like a creek under a road. Jim and I had fought it to a draw. Marcus had opted out by drinking bourbon. Dale had opted out by carving. Sienna had opted out by running push-ups until her arms shook, which was her version of meditation and which worked because exhausted muscles don't produce the same stress cascade as rested ones. We all got to the same place by different roads. The organism didn't care about the road. It cared about the destination.

The plan was simple because complicated plans produce anxiety. Marcus and Jim would walk eight blocks east on Maple Street to the Ozark Family Pharmacy. Sienna and I would watch from the steeple. Ruth, Dale, and Maria would stay in the basement. If anything went wrong — if Sienna or I saw the walkers in trouble — we would do nothing. That was the plan. Do nothing. Because running to help was the most natural, most human, most lethal response available, and the plan had to account for our instinct to be decent, and the way it accounted for it was by forbidding it.

Maria had argued against the mission entirely. "Jim has forty days of metoprolol. Ruth has twenty-five of atenolol. Dale has —" She'd paused, calibrating whether to say it. "Dale has his situation. We have time. Why risk two people for supplies we don't need this week?"

"Because we need them next month," I said. "And next month the Turned will be more numerous, more coordinated, and more hungry. The pharmacy is eight blocks away now. In three weeks it might be inside the perimeter of a swarm cluster. The window is closing."

Maria looked at me. She had an expression I was learning to read — the one that said *you're right and I don't like it.* "If Jim doesn't come back, we lose our moral center. If Marcus doesn't come back, we lose our navigator. You're spending irreplaceable resources on replaceable ones."

"The medications aren't replaceable. They're the only thing keeping three of our seven people below threshold. Without them —"

"I know the math, Nate. I'm the one who does the math." She turned to the pantry closet and adjusted a can of tomatoes that didn't need adjusting. "Go. But know the cost."

---

They left at 10 AM. Jim and Marcus. Two men walking east on a residential street in the quiet of an October morning that smelled like dead leaves and distant fire. I watched through the binoculars.

Sienna was beside me in the steeple. The space was narrow enough that our shoulders almost touched when we both leaned toward the louvers. I was focused on the binoculars. I was also focused on the almost-touching. I was capable of holding both kinds of attention simultaneously and it was making me worse at both of them.

"Your breathing's off," Sienna said.

"I'm fine."

"You're at sixteen breaths a minute. You should be at twelve."

"How do you know my breathing rate?"

"I can hear you. You're loud when you're stressed." She paused. "And when you're nervous."

I chose to interpret "nervous" as referring to the mission and not to the eighteen-inch gap between her shoulder and mine, and I adjusted my breathing and said nothing and she said nothing and the silence was the kind that has a lot of things in it.

Through the binoculars: Jim and Marcus reached the end of the church's block. Turned were visible — three on Maple, two in a yard on the cross street. Jim and Marcus walked past them. Steady pace. No eye contact. The Turned tracked them — that slow head-turn — and didn't approach.

Block two. A cluster of four Turned near a stop sign. Marcus adjusted his path, giving them a wider berth — twenty feet instead of ten. Jim matched. The cluster tracked, didn't move. I could see Jim's lips moving. He was either praying or counting breaths. Possibly both.

Block three. Empty. The houses here were dark, curtains drawn. Some had doors standing open — the residents gone, fled or turned, the homes left behind with the casual incompleteness of interrupted lives. A garden hose still running, the water pooling in a driveway. A bicycle on its side in a yard. Jim and Marcus walked through the remnants and didn't look at them the way you don't look at a car wreck — not because you don't see it but because seeing it costs something you can't afford.

Block four. The pharmacy was visible — a small building on the corner, glass front, sign that read OZARK FAMILY PHARMACY in green letters. The parking lot had two Turned in it. They stood near the entrance, not blocking it, just present.

Marcus stopped. He'd been steady for four blocks — the steadiest person in our group, his depression a chemical anchor — but now he stopped. I adjusted the binoculars. His hand was at his side. I could see it: a tremor. Small. The hand was shaking.

"What's happening?" Sienna said. She couldn't see it without the binoculars.

"Marcus stopped. His hand's shaking."

"His flask."

"What?"

"He hasn't had bourbon in five hours. He rationed it for the walk — nothing beforehand, so his reflexes are sharp. But the rebound is hitting. Remember? Alcohol suppresses short-term, then the anxiety spikes. He's in the rebound window right now."

I watched Marcus through the binoculars. He was standing in the middle of Maple Street, fifty feet from the pharmacy, and his hand was shaking and the two Turned in the parking lot were watching him. Not approaching. But watching, with that tilt, that evaluation.

Jim noticed. He turned back. He put his hand on Marcus's shoulder. I couldn't hear what he said. But I watched Marcus close his eyes. Take a breath. Jim's hand stayed on his shoulder. They stood there for maybe thirty seconds — a pastor and a truck driver on a residential street at the end of the world, one man holding the other steady through the sheer physical fact of contact.

Marcus opened his eyes. Nodded. They walked to the pharmacy.

---

The pharmacy had been looted.

The front door was broken — someone had put a rock through the glass in the first days. Inside, through the binoculars, I could see the mess: shelves knocked over, products scattered, the wreckage of a panicked raid. But as Marcus and Jim moved through the store, I could see what had been taken and what hadn't.

Gone: the narcotics cabinet, smashed open, emptied. The OxyContin, the Vicodin, the Xanax — every controlled substance that people knew by name and reputation, stripped clean. The antibiotics — amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin — gone, because antibiotics are the thing you know you need in a disaster.

Still there: metoprolol. Atenolol. Propranolol. Carvedilol. Bottles of beta-blockers sitting on shelves, undisturbed. Sertraline. Fluoxetine. Escitalopram. SSRIs, untouched. Clonazepam. Lorazepam. Anxiolytics, dusty and perfect. Buspirone. Hydroxyzine. The things that would have saved lives sitting in a pharmacy that had been raided for painkillers because people understood pain and didn't understand the mechanism that was killing them.

The right supplies were always there. Nobody took them because nobody knew.

Jim and Marcus loaded a bag. Through the binoculars I watched Marcus reading labels, selecting bottles, organizing by type. He was methodical now — the tremor was gone, replaced by the focus of a task. Jim kept watch. The two Turned in the parking lot had drifted to the far side, drawn by something to the east. The walk home was clear.

They made it back at 11:47 AM. Ninety minutes, round trip, for a walk that in the old world would have taken twenty minutes. Marcus came through the side door and set the bag on the folding table and unzipped it and inside were four months of beta-blockers, three months of SSRIs, two months of benzodiazepines, and a collection of anxiolytics that nobody in the church except me could pronounce.

"The narcotics were gone," Marcus said. "Everything people want to take was gone. Everything they needed to take was still there."

Ruth, descending the stairs, looked at the bottles. "That," she said, "is a metaphor for the entirety of the human condition."

Nobody argued with her.

---

That evening I distributed the medications. Jim's metoprolol was replenished — months of supply. Ruth's atenolol, the same. I set aside propranolol for Sienna — a beta-blocker she could take before high-stress situations, insurance against her baseline running hot. I set aside hydroxyzine — an antihistamine with anxiolytic properties — as a backup for anyone whose stress started climbing.

Dale was sitting in his chair, carving. The beagle was finished. The bird was finished — it was a cardinal, I realized, the details emerging from the wood with the specificity of a man who noticed things and expressed them through his hands instead of his mouth. He was starting on something new. A turtle, I thought. Something with a shell.

"There was no Suboxone," I said.

He didn't look up. "I know."

"Suboxone isn't a pharmacy medication. It's clinic-dispensed. The nearest clinic —"

"Fort Smith. I know." His knife moved. The wood curled. "Eighteen days is thirteen now. I've been counting."

"We could try to —"

"Nate." He looked up. His eyes were steady. The eyes of a man who had spent six years learning that the thing you depend on always runs out, and who had rebuilt a life around that knowledge, and who was now watching it happen again with the weary recognition of a pattern he couldn't break. "I've been through withdrawal before. Not Suboxone — the real thing. Heroin withdrawal. I know what it does. The shaking, the sweating, the anxiety spike — do you understand what an anxiety spike means in this context?"

I understood.

"When the Suboxone runs out, my body is going to do the thing that gets people turned. Not because I'm weak. Not because I want to. Because the chemistry of withdrawal is a catecholamine flood — cortisol, norepinephrine, all of it — and the organism doesn't know the difference between withdrawal anxiety and genuine fear. It reads the signal, not the cause."

"We'll manage it. Breathing exercises. The propranolol —"

"Maybe. Maybe that's enough." He looked at the wood in his hands. "Or maybe it isn't, and you'll need to be ready for that. You specifically, Nate. Because you're the one who thinks about contingencies and you're the one who'll know when I'm past the line, and if I cross it, I need you to get the others out of the room before I —"

He stopped. The knife was still. Maria, in the pantry closet, had her back to us but her hands had stopped moving.

"We have thirteen days," I said. "A lot can happen in thirteen days."

"Yeah." He picked up the knife. "That's what I'm afraid of."

**JOURNAL ENTRY #8:**

*The pharmacy run worked. Medications secured. The right supplies were on the shelves because nobody understood what they needed. The opioids were gone. The beta-blockers were untouched. If you want a one-sentence summary of why the world ended, it's that: people grabbed what felt urgent and left what was actually important because the important thing looked boring and had a name they couldn't pronounce.*

*Marcus nearly broke on block four. Alcohol rebound. His hands shaking in the street with two Turned watching. Jim pulled him through — literally, physically, one hand on his shoulder. I watched from the steeple and I couldn't help and I couldn't look away and I'm starting to understand that this is my role: the watcher. The person who sees everything and can do nothing about most of it. I don't know if that's a skill or a punishment.*

*Dale has thirteen days. I don't have a solution. The propranolol might bridge the withdrawal but "might" isn't a word I'm comfortable with when the failure mode is losing a person. Dale knows this better than I do. He's lived through withdrawal before. He knows exactly what it feels like when your chemistry betrays you, and he's asking me to be ready for the version of that where betrayal is permanent.*

*I need to be ready. I don't know what "ready" looks like. I don't think anyone does.*

# Chapter 14: The Septic Tank

Two days after the pharmacy run I did the stupidest thing I have ever done, and I include in that assessment the full catalogue of stupid things I have done in fifteen years of being a person with bad judgment and worse cardio.

I went scouting. Alone. Without telling anyone.

The reasoning was sound. This is the dangerous thing about bad decisions — they often start with good logic. We needed a map of the surrounding blocks: which houses were occupied by Turned, which were empty, which might have useful supplies. Sienna had been scouting, but Sienna's scouting was instinctive and unstructured — she'd go out, move fast, come back with impressions. I wanted data. Grid squares. Counts. An asset map cross-referenced with the Turned position log I'd been keeping from the steeple. And I wanted to do it myself because I was the one who understood the data, and because — I need to be honest about this — the pharmacy run had made me feel competent. Jim and Marcus had walked eight blocks and back. Sienna went to the military interchange. I was the one who hadn't gone anywhere except the steeple, and the distance between "the person who plans" and "the person who acts" had started to feel like an accusation.

So I went. 5:30 AM, just after dawn. I left a note on the table — "Scouting nearby blocks, back by 8" — which I told myself counted as telling people and which did not count as telling people.

The first three houses went fine. That's the sentence that should terrify you. "Fine" is the sound confidence makes before it kills you.

I moved slowly. Checked windows. Marked occupancy on a hand-drawn grid in the notebook. House one, Elm Street: empty, front door open, no supplies visible. House two: Turned inside, a man sitting at a kitchen table, staring at the wall, motionless. I watched him through the window for two minutes and he didn't move. House three: empty, pantry stocked — I noted the address for a future supply run.

House four was a ranch-style place on Oak, one story, attached garage, the kind of house that's built for a retired couple who wanted everything on one level. I went through a back window that was already broken — someone had tried to get in or out before me. The glass crunched under my shoes. I noticed the crunch and didn't account for it, because I was feeling competent, and competence is just fear wearing a graduation cap.

Inside: canned food in the pantry. A hand-crank radio on the kitchen counter. A set of tools in the garage. I was loading the backpack I'd brought — one of Marcus's, canvas, military surplus — when I heard the sound.

The drone. Low, vibrating, chest-resonant. The summoning call. Coming from outside, from the front of the house, from everywhere.

I went to the living room window.

Turned were coming. Not from one direction — from every direction. Walking in from the cross streets, emerging from between houses, converging on this house with the methodical precision of a net closing. I counted: five, ten, fifteen. Twenty. Twenty-five. I stopped counting at thirty because my hands were shaking and the binoculars — I'd brought them, I always brought them — were vibrating against my face.

I had made myself a data point. Thirty-plus Turned, converging on a single-story house with plywood-on-nothing walls, and me inside with a backpack full of canned peaches and no exit I'd tested. The organism had detected me — maybe the glass crunching, maybe scent, maybe the collective's pattern recognition flagging a house that had changed state from "empty" to "occupied" — and it had sent the net.

I knew about the density threshold. I'd written about it. I'd warned Craig Lyle about it. And now I was inside the threshold, watching it build in real time, and the distance between understanding a concept and being inside the concept was the distance between reading about drowning and having water in your lungs.

---

The house had no basement. The attic had a pull-down ladder — noisy. The garage had a rolling door — exposed. The back door opened onto a yard that was already filling with Turned coming around the sides of the house. They moved without hurry. They didn't need to hurry. The net was the tactic and the net was already closed.

Behind the backyard, across a chain-link fence, an older property. Overgrown. Weeds waist-high. And in the weeds, barely visible, a concrete disk — a septic tank access port. Decommissioned, probably, judging by the age of the house and the municipal sewer hookup I could see at the property line. The kind of thing you'd miss if you weren't looking for it.

I wasn't looking for it. I saw it.

My brain divided into two processes. Process one: rational analysis, calculating odds, noting that the Turned count was past thirty and climbing and that Moss had said the threshold was density-dependent and a parking lot might hold thirty but a residential lot would not. Process two: animal terror, the deep-brain survival system that doesn't calculate but instead screams *RUN NOW GO NOW MOVE* with a volume that drowns out everything else.

Process two won.

I went out the back door. I ran — thirty yards of gasping, wheezing sprint across the yard. I hit the chain-link fence and went over it with a coordination I did not know I possessed, fueled by the same adrenaline the organism was trying to harvest. I crashed through the weeds. I grabbed the concrete lid of the access port — it weighed maybe forty pounds, and I lifted it like it was cardboard because the body's emergency system has a turbo mode and it doesn't care about your usual limitations. I dropped into the tank.

It was partially drained. Decommissioned. But not empty — there was maybe ten inches of standing waste in the bottom, old and settled and black, and the smell was not a smell but a physical substance, thick and wet and coated, a thing that entered through the nose and the mouth and the pores and became part of you. My shoes sank into it. My stomach convulsed. I pulled the concrete lid back over the opening — scraping, grinding, and then dark, total dark — and I stood in human waste up to my shins in perfect blackness and pressed my hands over my mouth because vomiting is loud and loud is death.

---

Time does things in the dark.

I don't know how long I stood there before the sound changed. Twenty minutes? Thirty? The drone was audible through the concrete — muffled, felt more than heard, a vibration in the bones of the tank and through the soles of my shoes and up into my legs. Then footsteps above. Many footsteps. The collective had reached the house.

The sound that came next is the thing I don't talk about.

A roaring. Not voices — not the human sounds the Turned usually made, the mimicry, the drone. This was structural: wood splitting, glass shattering, something heavy being overturned and overturned again. The ranch house was coming apart. The swarm had hit threshold and the patient herding had collapsed into undirected destruction and the Turned were tearing through the house the way a tornado tears through a mobile home — not aimed, not purposeful, just force. Raw collective force applied to whatever was in reach.

It went on for an hour. Maybe longer. In the dark, in the tank, with the waste soaking through my clothes and the smell destroying my ability to think about anything except not vomiting, I pressed my hands over my ears and counted prime numbers. Two, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-three, twenty-nine. I counted them because they were orderly and because orderly things were the only defense I had against the chaos above me. The primes were reliable. They followed rules. They didn't change their minds or tear through walls or use your mother's voice to lure you outside.

I got to 547 before the sounds stopped. I don't know if 547 is prime. I think it is. I never checked. It doesn't matter. What matters is that by the time the destruction ended I had been standing in a septic tank for approximately three hours and my legs had gone numb and my hands were shaking so badly I couldn't have held the binoculars if I'd had them and my entire body was coated in a film of waste that I could feel on my skin like a second layer of something that was not me.

The frenzy burned out. Moss had described this in a fragment Marcus caught — the swarm's feedback loop was self-limiting. The collective violence escalated to a peak and then the signal scattered, the coordination broke, and the Turned dispersed in ones and twos, dazed, almost confused, like people waking from a blackout they couldn't remember. The footsteps above thinned. The drone faded. Silence — not the held-breath silence of the early days but a deeper silence, the silence of aftermath.

I waited. I waited until it was fully dark — hours after the last sound, hours of standing in the tank in the blackness with nothing to do but exist inside the consequences of my own confidence. Then I pushed the lid. It scraped. The night air hit me and I breathed it and it was the best breath I have ever taken and it was immediately followed by the worst, because the second breath carried my own smell back to me and I understood for the first time the full dimension of what I had done and what I was covered in and what I smelled like and I leaned over and vomited into the weeds and it didn't matter because nothing I produced could be worse than what was already on me.

I walked back to the church. In the dark. By memory. Moving slow, step by step, through streets I'd mapped from the steeple but had never walked at night. The Turned were in their positions but scattered thin — the post-frenzy dispersal. None approached. I don't know if this was because I was moving slowly or because I smelled like a septic tank and even the Turned had standards.

---

Sienna was at the side door.

She'd been there for hours. I could see it — the puffiness around her eyes, the rigid set of her jaw, the posture of a person who has been standing in one place holding themselves together through an act of will that has nothing left to hold. She'd thought I was dead. She'd heard the swarm from the church — everyone had — and she'd thought I was inside it.

She saw me. She smelled me. Her face did something complicated and fast — relief, then fury, then something else that I couldn't name.

"Oh my God, Nate. Oh my *God.*"

I walked past her. I couldn't talk. Not because I was choosing not to — because the machinery of speech had been offline for six hours and I didn't know how to restart it. I went to the rain barrel behind the church and tipped it over myself. The water was cold and it wasn't enough — not nearly enough — but it ran over me and carried some of the waste away and I stood there in the dark while the water ran out and Sienna stood three feet away not touching me and not leaving.

"I thought you were dead," she said. Her voice was level. The level voice was worse than screaming would have been. "I thought you were inside that house when they tore it apart. I heard it. We all heard it. Ruth was praying. Dale stopped carving. Maria started counting the food supply because that's what Maria does when she thinks someone's died — she recalculates. And I stood at this door for six hours and I didn't know if you were dead or turned or —"

"I was in a septic tank."

Silence.

"A septic —"

"A decommissioned septic tank behind the property east of the house. I dropped in and pulled the lid over and stood in it while they tore the house apart."

Another silence. Longer.

"You stood in a septic tank."

"For approximately six hours. Yes."

She stared at me. The moonlight caught her face and I watched her process this — the horror, the absurdity, the specific lunacy of a fifteen-year-old boy standing waist-deep in sewage in the dark counting prime numbers while the world destroyed itself above him — and something in her expression broke and the break was not grief and was not fury. She laughed.

It was short. One breath. More of a bark than a laugh. But it was real, and it was the first time I'd heard anyone laugh since before the Turned, and the sound of it cracked something in my chest that had been sealed shut for days.

"It's not funny," I said.

"It's a little funny."

"I was standing in human waste."

"And you survived. That's —" She stopped laughing. Her eyes were wet. "That's the most you thing possible. Everyone else would have fought or run or frozen. You hid in a toilet."

"It wasn't a toilet. It was a septic —"

"Nate. Shut up. Come inside." She paused. "Actually, don't come inside. You can't come inside smelling like that. Jim has church donation clothes in the office. I'll get them. Burn what you're wearing."

She went inside. I stood by the empty rain barrel in church-donation boxers and no shirt, shivering, holding my ruined clothes in a wad. When she came back with a pair of too-large khakis and a polo shirt that said ROTARY CLUB — DOVER CHAPTER on the chest, she handed them to me without looking and went back inside and I stood in the dark and got dressed and tried to feel something other than ashamed and failed.

---

I sat in the basement. My hands were still shaking. Jim had given me coffee — the last of the instant, reheated over a candle, terrible — and Ruth had looked at me once and said "You're an idiot" and gone back upstairs and that was Ruth's version of "I'm glad you're alive" and I understood the translation.

I opened the notebook. The pages were wrinkled — the notebook had been in my back pocket in the tank — and they smelled. Everything smelled. I would smell for days. The smell would become a joke and then a reference point and then a unit of measurement. Sienna would later say, during a particularly bad stretch of the trail, "This is about 0.6 septic tanks," and everyone would know exactly what she meant.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #9:**

*Lessons:*

*(1) Never go alone. I wrote this after Henderson's trailer. I didn't follow it. The lesson doesn't work if you don't follow it.*

*(2) Always have an exit you've already tested. I went into a house I'd never been in through a window I'd never used and my only exit was a septic tank I found by luck. Luck is not a strategy.*

*(3) The swarm threshold is real. It's not a concept. It's the sound of a house being torn apart by thirty human bodies moving in coordinated frenzy with no self-preservation and no off switch. You cannot calm your way through it. You can only not be there when it happens.*

*(4) Confidence is the thing that nearly killed me. Not fear — confidence. I went because the pharmacy run worked and because working made me feel like I knew what I was doing and knowing what you're doing is the most dangerous feeling in the world because it makes you forget that the world doesn't care what you know.*

*(5) If your only option is a septic tank, take the septic tank. You will hate yourself but you will be alive to hate yourself and alive is the prerequisite for everything else.*

*(6) Tell people where you're going. I left a note. A note is not telling people. Telling people is standing in front of them and saying "I'm going here" and watching them react and incorporating their reaction into your plan. A note is cowardice in written form. I know because Sienna stood at the door for six hours thinking I was dead and that is worse than the septic tank and worse than the swarm and worse than anything I've done in my life.*

*(7) Sienna laughed. In the middle of the worst night of my life, while I was standing in the dark covered in sewage, she laughed. It was the first laugh since before the Turned. I think laughter might be a survival tool. Not because it's calming — it's not, it spikes the heart rate — but because it's the sound the brain makes when it encounters something so far outside its model that the only response is to reboot. She rebooted. I needed it more than I needed the rain barrel.*

# Chapter 15: Sienna Runs

On Day 18, Sienna did the bravest and stupidest thing I have ever witnessed, and I am including the septic tank in that assessment because at least the septic tank only risked my own life.

I was in the basement inventorying the pharmacy haul when she came down the stairs from the steeple moving faster than I'd ever seen her move indoors.

"There's a kid," she said. "Two blocks south. In a yard. Alone. Crying."

The basement went still. Jim looked up from his Bible. Dale's knife paused. Maria, at the pantry, turned around.

"How old?" Jim asked.

"Young. Six, seven. A boy. He's sitting in the yard of that yellow house on Birch — the one with the swing set. He's just *sitting there,* and there are Turned on the next block and he's *crying,* Jim, he's crying and they're going to find him."

I was already moving to the stairs. "Let me see."

In the steeple, through the binoculars, I found him. A small figure in the yard of a yellow clapboard house — sitting in the grass next to a swing set, knees to his chest, rocking. I couldn't hear the crying from this distance but I could see it in his body: the shaking, the way his head dropped and lifted, the convulsive rhythm of a child who has been alone too long and has reached the end of whatever reserves a seven-year-old has.

Three Turned were visible on Birch Street. One block south of the child. Walking slowly, drifting, their standard patrol. They hadn't oriented toward him yet, but the crying — even at distance, even muffled by the glass of the steeple — was a sound that carried, and if I could see him from here, the Turned's network would register him soon. Crying is fear made audible. The organism would hear it the way a shark hears blood.

"We need to get him," Sienna said. She was behind me on the stairs, and her voice had a quality I hadn't heard before — an urgency that wasn't tactical. It was visceral. Primal. The voice of someone for whom this was not a strategic calculation.

"We need to think about —"

"He's seven, Nate. He's Jaylen's age. He's sitting in a yard *crying* and there are three of them one block away and if we don't go now —"

"If we go now without a plan, we risk —"

"Then I go." She was past me on the stairs, moving down. "I go alone. I'm fast. I can get there and back in four minutes."

"Sienna, *stop.*"

She stopped. Not because I said it with authority — I didn't have authority, I had a notebook and a history of hiding in septic tanks. She stopped because something in my voice caught her, the same way her hand on my elbow caught me during the crossing. A snag in the momentum.

"Running is the thing that kills people," I said. "You know this. You watched the soldiers. You told me yourself — the sergeant who stopped fighting was the one who survived. If you run two blocks, your heart rate goes to 160, 170, and you're carrying a crying child, and your adrenaline is spiking because of his fear and your fear feeding each other, and —"

"I know the mechanism, Nate."

"Then you know running is —"

"I know." Her eyes were bright. Not tears — intensity. The look of a person who understands exactly what they're about to do and has decided to do it anyway. "I'm not going to let a seven-year-old die because I'm managing my heart rate. That's not — I can't. I know the math. I know the risk. And I can't."

Jim was at the bottom of the stairs. He'd heard everything. He looked at Sienna and something passed between them — a recognition, an understanding that transcended the tactical framework. Jim, who had put the sign in the window. Jim, who had made coffee. Jim, who had done the right thing for the wrong reason and saved lives by the act of opening a door. He recognized what Sienna was doing because it was what he'd been doing for two weeks, and the fact that the organism punished it didn't make it wrong.

"Go," Jim said. "Walk as far as you can. Run only if you have to. And Nate —" He looked at me. "Watch. Don't follow."

---

I watched from the steeple.

Sienna left through the side door. She moved south on the residential streets, fast-walking — not running, not yet, but moving at the limit of walking speed, her athlete's body covering ground efficiently. Her posture was controlled. Her arms were at her sides. She was doing everything right.

Block one. Two Turned in a yard to the west. They tracked her — the head-turn. Didn't approach. She was moving fast but not panicking. The blood pressure cuff was on her wrist; I could see her glancing at it. Managing. Measuring. The runner who couldn't run, calculating her pace against her chemistry.

She reached Birch Street. The yellow house was there. The child was there — still in the yard, still rocking. From this angle, closer now, I could see his face: dark hair, light skin, streaked with dirt and tears. Seven, maybe six. Wearing pajamas and one shoe. He'd been alone for days — you could see it in the way he held himself, the fetal curl, the complete abdication of the vigilance that even children maintain when they believe someone is coming. He'd stopped believing.

Sienna approached him. Slowly. She crouched down. She was talking to him — I couldn't hear the words. The child looked up. His face changed — the blank despair breaking into something raw and desperate, the face of a drowning person seeing a hand.

He reached for her. She picked him up.

And the three Turned on the next block turned toward them.

Here is what I saw from the steeple and what I did about it.

I saw Sienna pick up the child. I saw the child clutch her neck and press his face against her shoulder and I saw his body convulse with sobs — real sobs, the kind that shake the whole frame — and I saw the sound of those sobs ripple outward like a stone dropped in water because the three Turned on the south end of Birch had stopped drifting and were walking toward the yellow house with a purpose that wasn't their standard patrol.

I saw Sienna stand. I saw her assess — the child on her hip, the Turned incoming, the two blocks back to the church. I saw the moment she made the calculation and the moment the calculation said *run.*

She ran.

She ran the way she was built to run — long stride, balanced, the biomechanics of a girl who'd trained for the 400-meter since she was twelve. Even carrying a child, even with the wrong shoes and the cracked asphalt and the two blocks of residential street between her and safety, she was fast. She covered the first block in maybe forty seconds.

Through the binoculars I watched her face. Her mouth was open. Her chest was heaving. And her expression was the thing I'd been afraid of — not fear but something beyond fear, the expression of a person whose body is doing the thing the organism needs. I could see the flush climbing her neck and her jawline, the exertion and the adrenaline merging into a single biochemical signal, and the Turned behind her were closing — not running, they never ran, but more of them now, emerging from between houses, drawn by the sound of crying and the scent of terror, five, six, seven.

The child was screaming. Not words — a continuous wail, the sound of a child who has been alone for days and has been picked up by a stranger and is being carried at a sprint through a world that has stopped making sense. The sound carried. Every Turned in a two-block radius was orienting toward it.

Sienna reached the church's block. Fifty yards to the side door. She was sprinting flat out and the child was screaming and behind her the Turned were converging and I could see — through the binoculars, at magnification, in the kind of detail I didn't want — the moment something changed in her stride.

A hitch. A falter. Not fatigue — something else. Her right foot caught the asphalt wrong and she stumbled half a step and caught herself and kept running but the stumble wasn't physical. I'd seen her run before, watched her do laps around the church yard in the mornings when she thought no one was watching. She didn't stumble. She was too good, too trained, too controlled. The stumble came from inside — a disruption in the signal between brain and body, a glitch in the operating system.

She was at the edge.

She described it to me later — the warmth. A spreading heat that started in her chest and moved outward, into her arms, her face, her skull. A buzzing, subsonic, like the drone the Turned made but from inside, from the base of her brain stem, vibrating through the bones of her skull. A feeling of the self loosening — not pain, not fear, but a slackening, as if the thing that held "Sienna" together was being gently, patiently, pulled apart from the inside. The organism finding the gap between body and identity and pressing into it.

She was twenty yards from the door.

Jim had the door open. He was standing in the threshold with his arms out, the posture of a man catching something falling. Sienna crossed the parking lot. The child was screaming. She was running. The Turned were fifteen yards behind — close enough that I could see their faces through the binoculars, the smooth blankness, the absence of expression that was its own kind of expression.

She made it through the door.

Jim slammed it shut. I heard the bolt. From the steeple, two floors up, I heard the bolt engage and I heard Sienna hit the floor — not fall, collapse, the controlled descent of a body that has been pushed past its limit and is shutting down to protect itself.

I watched the Turned arrive at the door. Seven of them. They stood in the parking lot. They didn't try the door. Below threshold — seven wasn't enough for the frenzy. They stood and they waited and after forty minutes they drifted away.

I came downstairs.

Sienna was on the basement floor. Ruth had a blanket over her. The child — later we'd learn his name was Caleb, Caleb Reeves, seven years old, from the yellow house on Birch, parents gone since Day 2 — was in Jim's arms, silent now, the screaming replaced by the exhausted stillness of a child who has cried until there's nothing left. Dale was carving. Maria was counting cans. The rhythms of the group absorbing a crisis, each person processing through their particular ritual.

Sienna's hands were shaking. Not the small tremor Marcus had shown during the pharmacy run — a full-body vibration, deep, the kind that starts in the core and radiates outward. She was wrapped in the blanket and shaking inside it and her eyes were closed and her face was wet and she was breathing in the pattern Jim had taught — four in, hold, six out — but the pattern was ragged, broken by the shaking, the breathing of a person who was holding herself together with technique because everything else had failed.

I sat next to her. On the floor. Not touching. Present.

"I felt it," she said. Eyes still closed. "The edge. I know where it is now."

"You came back."

"Barely." A breath. "It's not a line, Nate. It's not a threshold you cross. It's — it's a dissolving. You start to come apart. Not all at once. The edges go first. The parts of you that are optional — your name, your history, your preferences. They start to feel like clothes you're wearing instead of skin. And the thing that's dissolving them isn't violent. It's gentle. It's the most terrifying thing about it. It feels like being invited to stop being yourself. Like the organism is saying, 'You can put this down now. You can stop carrying all of this. Just let go.'"

I didn't say anything. I sat next to her and I didn't say anything because there was nothing to say that wouldn't be insufficient.

"I almost did," she whispered. "For half a second. I almost let go. Not because I wanted to turn. Because I was so tired of being afraid and it was offering me a way to stop. And the only reason I didn't is that Caleb was in my arms and if I let go he'd fall."

She opened her eyes. They were red. She looked at me.

"You were watching."

"From the steeple. Yes."

"You saw all of it."

"Yes."

"And you stayed in the steeple."

"Jim told me —"

"I know what Jim told you. I'm not asking what Jim told you. I'm asking what you did."

I didn't answer. The answer was: I watched. From a safe distance, through binoculars, I watched the person I — I watched Sienna almost die, almost become something else, and I stayed where I was and did nothing because doing nothing was the safe choice and the smart choice and the correct choice and it was also the choice that a coward would make and I couldn't tell the difference anymore.

"You did the right thing," she said. "Staying. Watching. Not following. If you'd come after me, I'd have had to worry about you, and worrying about you would have pushed me over. You staying put kept me below the line."

"That's rational."

"It's also true. Are you going to accept it or are you going to punish yourself?"

"Both, probably."

She almost smiled. Almost. The ghost of the laugh she'd given me after the septic tank — the sound of a brain encountering something outside its model. Then the almost-smile faded and she closed her eyes again and the shaking continued and I sat next to her and didn't touch her and the not-touching was its own kind of contact, the way silence between two people who understand each other is its own kind of conversation.

Caleb was asleep in Jim's arms. Seven years old. Pajamas and one shoe. He'd survived for days alone in a house where his parents had turned, hiding under his bed, drinking water from the bathroom tap, eating cereal from the box. He'd come outside because he couldn't stand being alone anymore, and the not-standing-it had been louder than the fear, and that was why he was crying in the yard — not because he was afraid but because he was choosing to not be alone even if not being alone meant dying.

Seven years old and he'd made a choice that most adults couldn't make. Sienna had honored that choice by running. I had honored it by not running. And the organism had learned — because it was always learning — that the small, crying ones could draw the fast, brave ones into range.

I didn't write this last thought in the journal. Some observations are too ugly to record.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #10:**

*Sienna almost turned today saving a kid. She did the right thing and it almost killed her — not killed her, worse than killed her. Killed is an ending. Turning is a continuation in a form that uses your face and your voice and your memories to hunt the people you loved.*

*I watched from the steeple. I did the safe thing. The smart thing. The thing the mechanism demanded. And it was also the cowardly thing and I don't know if those are different things anymore.*

*The Turned don't punish bad people. They punish brave ones. They punish the ones who run toward the crying. They punish the instinct that makes humans human — the impulse to help, to connect, to risk yourself for someone else. The organism has designed a world where kindness is a death sentence and selfishness is a survival strategy. I don't know what kind of world that is. I don't know what kind of person survives it. I'm afraid the answer is: my kind. The kind who watches. The kind who calculates. The kind who stays in the steeple.*

*Caleb is seven. He's asleep in Jim's arms. Dale is carving him a dinosaur because Sienna asked him to and Dale would carve anything Sienna asked him to because everyone would do anything Sienna asked them to because she is the person who ran toward the crying while the rest of us watched from windows.*

*Eight people now. Fifteen days of food at current rationing. The cost of doing the right thing is 1.3 days. Maria was right about the arithmetic. She's always right about the arithmetic. The arithmetic is not the point.*
