# Chapter 13: The Pharmacy Run

On Day 15, we walked to the pharmacy.

I want to describe this honestly, which means I need to tell you what a supply run looks like when the supplies you need aren't weapons or ammunition but pills that suppress your ability to be afraid. In every movie, in every game, the supply run is a set piece — tactical gear, loaded weapons, a van with the engine running. Somebody says "let's move" and music plays and people do cool things under pressure. This was not that.

This was four people sitting in a church basement for two hours arguing about breathing.

"In through the nose," Jim said. "Four counts. Hold four. Out through the mouth, six counts. Feel the exhale longer than the inhale — that's the vagal brake, it downshifts the sympathetic nervous system."

"You learned that in Vietnam?" Marcus asked.

"I learned it from a counselor at the VA in 1978. She called it 'combat breathing.' I called it prayer with a timer. It's the same thing."

"It's not the same thing."

"Marcus, if it produces the same result, it's the same thing. We've been over this."

They'd been over it. This argument — the mechanism of calm, whether it mattered why something worked or only that it worked — ran underneath every conversation like a creek under a road. Jim and I had fought it to a draw. Marcus had opted out by drinking bourbon. Dale had opted out by carving. Sienna had opted out by running push-ups until her arms shook, which was her version of meditation and which worked because exhausted muscles don't produce the same stress cascade as rested ones. We all got to the same place by different roads. The organism didn't care about the road. It cared about the destination.

The plan was simple because complicated plans produce anxiety. Marcus and Jim would walk eight blocks east on Maple Street to the Ozark Family Pharmacy. Sienna and I would watch from the steeple. Ruth, Dale, and Maria would stay in the basement. If anything went wrong — if Sienna or I saw the walkers in trouble — we would do nothing. That was the plan. Do nothing. Because running to help was the most natural, most human, most lethal response available, and the plan had to account for our instinct to be decent, and the way it accounted for it was by forbidding it.

We did have one contingency. The hand-crank radio from Henderson's house — the one I'd found during scouting — was positioned on the church roof, wedged against the steeple base where it wouldn't blow off. If Jim and Marcus got into trouble, Sienna would climb out through the steeple hatch and crank it. Continuous noise, loud, from an elevated position two blocks away from the pharmacy. The hymnal experiment had shown thirty seconds of attention from a single sound. A sustained broadcast should buy longer — enough for two men to change direction, take a side street, disappear. Distraction as standard operating procedure. It wasn't much. It was what we had.

Dale, from his chair, said something that had nothing to do with the pharmacy and everything to do with the question Marcus had planted two days earlier. "What if we trapped one?"

The planning paused.

"Not killed," Dale said. His knife was moving — he was working on the turtle now, the shell taking shape in careful symmetry. "Trapped. Lure one into a room. Lock the door. Watch what it does. Does it call? Does it try to escape? Does it sit down and do the thing it was doing before, like nothing changed?" He looked up. "Because if it calls — if trapping one brings the others — then killing one probably does too. And if it doesn't call, then maybe a single Turned separated from the group behaves differently. Maybe there's something to learn."

Maria's eyes had the calculating look. "That's also how you'd test whether they can be sedated. Isolate one, administer a dose, observe the response."

Jim was uncomfortable — I could see it in the way his hands pressed together. But he didn't object. Observation wasn't killing. Containment wasn't violence. "After the pharmacy," he said. "One thing at a time."

The idea stayed on the table. Not approved. Not dismissed. Tabled, which in a small group is its own form of approval — the acknowledgment that the question deserved an answer, even if the answer scared you.

Maria had argued against the mission entirely. "Jim has forty days of metoprolol. Ruth has twenty-five of atenolol. Dale has —" She'd paused, calibrating whether to say it. "Dale has his situation. We have time. Why risk two people for supplies we don't need this week?"

"Because we need them next month," I said. "And next month the Turned will be more numerous, more coordinated, and more hungry. The pharmacy is eight blocks away now. In three weeks it might be inside the perimeter of a swarm cluster. The window is closing."

Maria looked at me. She had an expression I was learning to read — the one that said *you're right and I don't like it.* "If Jim doesn't come back, we lose our moral center. If Marcus doesn't come back, we lose our navigator. You're spending irreplaceable resources on replaceable ones."

"The medications aren't replaceable. They're the only thing keeping three of our seven people below threshold. Without them —"

"I know the math, Nate. I'm the one who does the math." She turned to the pantry closet and adjusted a can of tomatoes that didn't need adjusting. "Go. But know the cost."

---

They left at 10 AM. Jim and Marcus. Two men walking east on a residential street in the quiet of an October morning that smelled like dead leaves and distant fire. Jim had one walkie-talkie clipped to his belt, volume low. I had the other in my hand, beside the binoculars.

Sienna was beside me in the steeple. The space was narrow enough that our shoulders almost touched when we both leaned toward the louvers. I was focused on the binoculars. I was also focused on the almost-touching. I was capable of holding both kinds of attention simultaneously and it was making me worse at both of them.

"Your breathing's off," Sienna said.

"I'm fine."

"You're at sixteen breaths a minute. You should be at twelve."

"How do you know my breathing rate?"

"I can hear you. You're loud when you're stressed." She paused. "And when you're nervous."

I chose to interpret "nervous" as referring to the mission and not to the eighteen-inch gap between her shoulder and mine, and I adjusted my breathing and said nothing and she said nothing and the silence was the kind that has a lot of things in it.

Through the binoculars: Jim and Marcus reached the end of the church's block. Turned were visible — three on Maple, two in a yard on the cross street.

I keyed the walkie-talkie. "Three on Maple, north side. Two more in the yard on the cross street, east. You're clear on the south sidewalk."

Jim's hand moved to his belt — a brief acknowledgment tap, not a verbal reply. We'd worked this out beforehand: I talked, they listened. Every transmission was a risk — the radios were quiet but not silent, and we didn't know if the Turned responded to electronic sound the way they responded to human voices. So Jim and Marcus stayed off the radio unless they needed to. I was the eyes. They were the feet. The steeple and the street connected by twelve dollars of yellow plastic.

Jim and Marcus walked past the three on Maple. Steady pace. No eye contact. The Turned tracked them — that slow head-turn — and didn't approach.

Block two. A cluster of four Turned near a stop sign. I could see them before Jim and Marcus could — the elevation gave me a full block of advance warning.

"Four at the stop sign, block two. Tight cluster. Recommend the south side — give them twenty feet."

Marcus adjusted his path, giving them a wider berth — twenty feet instead of ten. Jim matched. The cluster tracked, didn't move. I could see Jim's lips moving. He was either praying or counting breaths. Possibly both.

Block three. Empty. The houses here were dark, curtains drawn. Some had doors standing open — the residents gone, fled or turned, the homes left behind with the casual incompleteness of interrupted lives. A garden hose still running, the water pooling in a driveway. A bicycle on its side in a yard.

"Block three is clear. No movement. Pharmacy visible ahead — two in the parking lot."

Jim and Marcus walked through the remnants and didn't look at them the way you don't look at a car wreck — not because you don't see it but because seeing it costs something you can't afford.

Block four. The pharmacy was visible — a small building on the corner, glass front, sign that read OZARK FAMILY PHARMACY in green letters. The parking lot had two Turned in it. They stood near the entrance, not blocking it, just present.

Marcus stopped. He'd been steady for four blocks — the steadiest person in our group, his depression a chemical anchor — but now he stopped. I adjusted the binoculars. His hand was at his side. I could see it: a tremor. Small. The hand was shaking.

"What's happening?" Sienna said. She couldn't see it without the binoculars.

"Marcus stopped. His hand's shaking."

"His flask."

"What?"

"He hasn't had bourbon in five hours. He rationed it for the walk — nothing beforehand, so his reflexes are sharp. But the rebound is hitting. Remember? Alcohol suppresses short-term, then the anxiety spikes. He's in the rebound window right now."

I watched Marcus through the binoculars. He was standing in the middle of Maple Street, fifty feet from the pharmacy, and his hand was shaking and the two Turned in the parking lot were watching him. Not approaching. But watching, with that tilt, that evaluation.

I keyed the radio. Kept my voice low, steady — the tone mattered as much as the words. "Jim. The two in the lot are watching but not moving. You have time. Marcus needs a minute."

Jim noticed. He turned back. He put his hand on Marcus's shoulder. I couldn't hear what he said — he didn't use the radio for it, because some things are between two people and not for a fifteen-year-old in a steeple. But I watched Marcus close his eyes. Take a breath. Jim's hand stayed on his shoulder. They stood there for maybe thirty seconds — a pastor and a truck driver on a residential street at the end of the world, one man holding the other steady through the sheer physical fact of contact.

Marcus opened his eyes. Nodded. They walked to the pharmacy.

---

The pharmacy had been looted.

The front door was broken — someone had put a rock through the glass in the first days. Inside, through the binoculars, I could see the mess: shelves knocked over, products scattered, the wreckage of a panicked raid. But as Marcus and Jim moved through the store, I could see what had been taken and what hadn't.

Gone: the narcotics cabinet, smashed open, emptied. The OxyContin, the Vicodin, the Xanax — every controlled substance that people knew by name and reputation, stripped clean. The antibiotics — amoxicillin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin — gone, because antibiotics are the thing you know you need in a disaster.

Still there: metoprolol. Atenolol. Propranolol. Carvedilol. Bottles of beta-blockers sitting on shelves, undisturbed. Sertraline. Fluoxetine. Escitalopram. SSRIs, untouched. Clonazepam. Lorazepam. Anxiolytics, dusty and perfect. Buspirone. Hydroxyzine. The things that would have saved lives sitting in a pharmacy that had been raided for painkillers because people understood pain and didn't understand the mechanism that was killing them.

The right supplies were always there. Nobody took them because nobody knew.

Jim and Marcus loaded a bag. Through the binoculars I watched Marcus reading labels, selecting bottles, organizing by type. He was methodical now — the tremor was gone, replaced by the focus of a task. Jim kept watch. The two Turned in the parking lot had drifted to the far side, drawn by something to the east.

"Route's clear back to block two," I radioed. "The cluster at the stop sign has dispersed — one left, stationary. Recommend the same path, south sidewalk."

Jim's voice came through the static — the first time he'd transmitted. "Copy. Five minutes." The brevity was Jim: no wasted words, no wasted signal.

They made it back at 11:47 AM. Ninety minutes, round trip, for a walk that in the old world would have taken twenty minutes. Marcus came through the side door and set the bag on the folding table and unzipped it and inside were four months of beta-blockers, three months of SSRIs, two months of benzodiazepines, and a collection of anxiolytics that nobody in the church except me could pronounce.

"The narcotics were gone," Marcus said. "Everything people want to take was gone. Everything they needed to take was still there."

Ruth, descending the stairs, looked at the bottles. "That," she said, "is a metaphor for the entirety of the human condition."

Nobody argued with her.

That night Jim broke out a bottle of grape juice he'd been saving in the sacristy — communion supplies, the good kind, not the Dollar General brand — and poured small cups for everyone, and we toasted nothing and everything, and Maria said "to surviving" and Ruth said "to antibiotics" and Marcus raised his cup and didn't say anything because he was smiling and Marcus smiling was rare enough to count as a toast on its own. Dale carved a small pill bottle out of a chunk of two-by-four and put it on the shelf next to the beagle and the cardinal, and when I asked him why, he said, "Because we did a hard thing and lived, and that should have a shape."

We passed hours like that sometimes — not many, but enough. Enough to remember later. Enough to build the quiet architecture that held us together between the crises. I don't narrate all of them because some things lose their meaning when you try to pin them down with words. But they happened. They happened more often than the fear, if I'm honest. The fear was louder but the ordinary hours were longer, and if you added them up — the cups of grape juice, the chapters of the romance novel, the evenings where the only sound was Dale's knife and the hum of the emitter and someone breathing the particular way you breathe when you're almost asleep but not quite — they would outweigh the crises by a factor of ten. The journal doesn't reflect this because journals are biased toward events, and sitting together in a basement drinking grape juice is not an event. But it should be.

---

That evening I distributed the medications. Jim's metoprolol was replenished — months of supply. Ruth's atenolol, the same. I set aside propranolol for Sienna — a beta-blocker she could take before high-stress situations, insurance against her baseline running hot. I set aside hydroxyzine — an antihistamine with anxiolytic properties — as a backup for anyone whose stress started climbing.

Dale was sitting in his chair, carving. The beagle was finished. The bird was finished — it was a cardinal, I realized, the details emerging from the wood with the specificity of a man who noticed things and expressed them through his hands instead of his mouth. He was starting on something new. A turtle, I thought. Something with a shell.

"There was no Suboxone," I said.

He didn't look up. "I know."

"Suboxone isn't a pharmacy medication. It's clinic-dispensed. The nearest clinic —"

"Fort Smith. I know." His knife moved. The wood curled. "Eighteen days is thirteen now. I've been counting."

I set a book on the table between us — the PDR, the Physician's Desk Reference, brick-thick, that Marcus had grabbed from behind the pharmacist's counter. I'd been through it already, cross-referencing everything we had against everything that could theoretically touch an opioid receptor.

"I looked at alternatives," I said. "Methadone — same problem, clinic-controlled, not stocked at retail pharmacies. Tramadol — we found some. It's a weak opioid agonist. It might take the edge off the worst physical symptoms, but it won't prevent full withdrawal. Think of it as a Band-Aid on a broken leg."

"I've taken tramadol," Dale said. "It's nothing."

"Loperamide. Imodium. High doses act on opioid receptors — they call it the poor man's methadone in some recovery circles. Helps the physical symptoms. Cramps, sweating, the GI cascade. Won't touch the anxiety, which is —"

"Which is the part that kills me. In this context. Yes."

"And kratom, theoretically, if we could find a head shop, but the risk of a supply run to —"

"The risk isn't worth the payoff. I know kratom. It's inconsistent, under-dosed, and the withdrawal from kratom itself is its own nightmare." He set the knife down. "You researched all this."

"I research everything. It's the thing I do instead of being useful." The words came out before I could stop them — the self-deprecation, the joke, the deflection Sienna had named two days ago. I heard it and for the first time I heard what she heard: not humility but armor.

Dale looked at me. "The reason Suboxone matters — do you actually understand, pharmacologically?"

"Partial agonist with a ceiling effect. It occupies the opioid receptors enough to prevent withdrawal without producing a high. The ceiling means you can't overdose on it the way you can with full agonists. Nothing at that pharmacy replicates that balance. Everything is either too weak to prevent withdrawal or too strong to be safe without medical supervision."

"So there's no substitute."

"There's no substitute. There's bridging. Propranolol for the heart rate spikes. Clonazepam for acute anxiety — carefully, because benzodiazepines have their own dependency risk. And breathing. Jim's technique."

Dale picked up the knife. He was quiet for a long time. The wood curled.

"In recovery," he said, "they say 'the only way out is through.' I always thought that was cheap wisdom. Something you stitch on a pillow." He turned the carving in his hands. "Turns out it's just accurate. We bridge with what we have. Propranolol, clonazepam, breathing. And when those aren't enough —" He shrugged. "Through."

He was quiet for a while. The knife moved. Then he looked up, and his eyes had changed — not the flat steadiness of acceptance but something rawer. The eyes of a man who had spent six years learning that the thing you depend on always runs out, and who had rebuilt a life around that knowledge, and who was now watching it happen again with the weary recognition of a pattern he couldn't break.

"You need to be ready for what happens if 'through' isn't enough," he said. "You specifically, Nate. Because you're the one who thinks about contingencies and you're the one who'll know when I'm past the line, and if I cross it, I need you to get the others out of the room before I —"

He stopped. The knife was still. Maria, in the pantry closet, had her back to us but her hands had stopped moving.

"We have thirteen days," I said. "A lot can happen in thirteen days."

"Yeah." He picked up the knife. "That's what I'm afraid of."

**JOURNAL ENTRY #8:**

*The pharmacy run worked. Medications secured. The right supplies were on the shelves because nobody understood what they needed. The opioids were gone. The beta-blockers were untouched. If you want a one-sentence summary of why the world ended, it's that: people grabbed what felt urgent and left what was actually important because the important thing looked boring and had a name they couldn't pronounce.*

*Marcus nearly broke on block four. Alcohol rebound. His hands shaking in the street with two Turned watching. I radioed Jim — told him the Turned were watching but not moving, that he had time. Jim pulled him through — literally, physically, one hand on his shoulder. I guided them around the cluster on block two, warned them when the route was clear. From the steeple I could see everything and affect some of it and I'm starting to understand that this is my role: the eyes. The person who sees the pattern and calls it down to the people in the middle of it. It's not nothing. But it's not enough. It's never going to feel like enough.*

*Dale has thirteen days. I don't have a solution. The propranolol might bridge the withdrawal but "might" isn't a word I'm comfortable with when the failure mode is losing a person. Dale knows this better than I do. He's lived through withdrawal before. He knows exactly what it feels like when your chemistry betrays you, and he's asking me to be ready for the version of that where betrayal is permanent.*

*I need to be ready. I don't know what "ready" looks like. I don't think anyone does.*

---

On Day 16 — the day between the pharmacy run and the stupidest thing I've ever done — Marcus answered his own question.

He didn't ask permission. Marcus wasn't a committee person. He'd asked the question on Day 10 and nobody had answered it and the not-answering had been eating at him the way the flask ate at him — a low, persistent hunger for resolution that no amount of group discussion could satisfy. So at 7 AM, while Jim was on morning watch in the steeple and the rest of us were eating cold oatmeal in the basement, Marcus put on his jacket and picked up the hand hatchet from the tool bag and went out the side door.

I know this because Jim radioed down. His voice was flat, controlled, the voice of a man watching something he couldn't stop. "Marcus is outside. He's walking toward the lot. He has the hatchet."

I was up the stairs in thirty seconds. Sienna was behind me. Through the binoculars I found Marcus — moving south across the parking lot, steady pace, the hatchet low at his side. He was heading toward the nearest Turned: a man I'd catalogued as "Blue Polo," one of the original sixteen, who stood near the parking lot entrance facing east with the standard vacant expression and the standard wrong smile.

"Marcus," I said into the walkie-talkie. "Marcus, stop. We don't know what happens."

He didn't respond. The radio was on his belt. He could hear me. He kept walking.

At twenty feet, Blue Polo tracked him. The head-turn — slow, automatic, the same tracking they gave Jim on his morning walks, the same passive monitoring they gave everything that moved. Marcus kept coming. Fifteen feet. The smile was there. The organism trying to herd, to convert, to do what it always did.

At ten feet, Marcus's pace changed. He was no longer walking past. He was walking *toward.* Deliberately. The hatchet came up.

I saw the shift.

It happened in the Turned's eyes first — a snap, like a lens focusing. The vacant drift locked onto Marcus with a precision that hadn't been there a second ago. Then the body changed. Blue Polo dropped into a crouch so fast it looked like his strings had been cut — but it wasn't a collapse. It was a coil. Low, weight on the balls of his feet, knees bent, and his hands came up. Fingers spread. Curled. Not fists — claws, the fingers hooked and rigid, the posture of something that had hunted before on worlds that weren't this one.

The smile was gone. What replaced it was *hunger.* A focused, predatory stare that tracked Marcus the way a cat tracks a bird through glass. The face wasn't vacant anymore. It was *intent* — every muscle taut, the jaw slightly open, the eyes locked and unblinking and radiating something older than human expression had words for.

Blue Polo rose onto his toes. And he began to move.

Fast. Quiet. Not the shuffling drift of a herder — a stalking, fluid advance, low to the ground, closing the distance on tiptoes with a silence that was worse than any sound. He moved like water moving downhill. Like something for which this movement was natural, practiced, ancient.

Then the bark. Short. Sharp. A single percussive sound that came from Blue Polo's chest, not his throat — a vibration that carried across the parking lot and hit the other Turned like a switch being thrown.

Three of them dropped into the same crouch. Same claws. Same hungry focus. The nearest was fifty yards away and she covered twenty of those yards in the time it took me to process what I was seeing — on her toes, silent, hands up, fingers curled, closing on Marcus from the east while Blue Polo closed from the south.

"Marcus, *run!*" I said it into the radio and out loud and neither was loud enough.

Marcus swung. The hatchet connected — a single downward strike to the base of Blue Polo's skull, the kind of blow you give a fence post with a splitting maul. The impact made a sound I don't want to describe. Blue Polo dropped. He dropped the way a person drops — instantly, totally, the body going from animate to inanimate in the space between one heartbeat and the absence of the next.

He died like a person. That's the thing I can't get past. The organism made him move like a predator and sound like something from another world, but he died like a man. The body that hit the gravel was a human body and the blood that pooled under his head was human blood.

Marcus didn't have time to look at what he'd done. The three hunters were coming — fast, silent, converging from three directions on tiptoes with their claws up and their faces locked in that focused, predatory stare. Marcus turned and ran. He ran the way a man runs when the thing behind him doesn't need to breathe hard — flat out, no looking back, the hatchet still in his hand and his boots slamming the gravel and behind him the three hunters moving in that terrible fluid silence, gaining, gaining.

He made it to the side door with maybe five yards to spare. Jim had it open — Jim, who'd come down from the steeple in the time it took Marcus to cross the lot, who'd understood what was needed and been there, the way Jim was always there when someone was running toward a door. Marcus came through and Jim slammed it and the bolt engaged and outside I could hear them — not the drone, not the herding voices, but a sound I hadn't heard before: a low, continuous, focused breathing, three sets of lungs working in concert, punctuated by that bark, that short sharp coordination call, as they circled the building looking for another way in.

They circled for forty minutes. Then, slowly, the hunting posture faded. They straightened. The claws relaxed. The focused stare went vacant. One by one they drifted back to their positions and resumed the standard herding posture — smiling, swaying, faces to the sun, as if nothing had happened. As if their bodies hadn't just been something else entirely.

---

The hatchet sat on the church steps. Nobody picked it up.

The blade was dark with blood that was already drying in the October air. Marcus had dropped it on his way through the door and it lay on the concrete like an accusation. Maria was the first to address it.

"Is it transmissible?" she said. "Through blood. Through skin contact. If the organism is in the host's circulatory system —"

Nobody knew. Marcus was sitting on a pew, breathing hard, his hands on his knees. His right hand — the hatchet hand — had blood on the knuckles and the wrist. He'd already poured bleach water over it, the kind of thorough, panicked scrubbing that accomplishes everything chemically and nothing psychologically.

"We need to assume it could be," I said. "Until we know otherwise, Turned blood is a biohazard. Contact with broken skin, mucous membranes, open cuts — any of those could be a transmission route."

"We don't know that," Marcus said. His voice was flat.

"We don't know it isn't. And the cost of being wrong is conversion through a cut instead of through fear. A new vector."

The room was quiet. We'd added a new fear to the collection. Not just turning from panic. Turning from a scratch. From a splash of blood. From the hatchet sitting on the church steps.

Dale picked up the hatchet with a dish towel — carefully, not touching the blade — and carried it to the backyard. He burned the wooden handle. Maria boiled the steel head in the church kitchen's largest pot for thirty minutes. She checked Marcus's blood pressure every hour for the rest of the day. 118/76. 120/78. 116/74. Normal. Normal. Normal.

But the normalcy didn't mean safe. It meant *not yet.*

That afternoon, from the steeple, I watched what the Turned did with the body.

It took about three hours. The herders had drifted back to their positions after the hunting posture faded — all except two. These two knelt beside Blue Polo's body where it lay on the gravel, and they ate. Not frenzied. Not the swarm behavior. Methodical. Directed. The hunting mode applied to something that couldn't run. They pulled and tore with their hands, working through the soft tissue with an efficiency that said the organism had done this before, on other worlds, with other hosts. A third joined after twenty minutes, drawn by the behavior or the scent.

By late afternoon, what remained on the gravel was mostly skeletal. Bones, tendons, the durable architecture of a human body stripped of everything the organism could metabolize. The three feeders drifted back to their positions, faced the sun, and resumed the standard herding posture as if nothing had happened. The bones stayed on the gravel. Nobody went to collect them. The organism disposed of its dead by consuming them.

I watched the whole thing. I watched because watching was what I did and because looking away felt like a betrayal of the man Marcus had killed — the man who had coached Little League, the man Jim called Gary Sutton, the man whose bones were now scattered in a church parking lot because Marcus had wanted to answer a question and the answer was worse than the question.

In the steeple that evening, I wrote in the notebook:

*Marcus killed a Turned today. It died like a person. But the organism detected his approach before he was close enough to swing. At ten feet, the Turned shifted — dropped into a crouch, hands up, fingers curled like claws, rose onto its toes and came at Marcus in a stalking run that was silent and fast and nothing like the shuffling drift of the herders. The smile was gone. What replaced it was a predator. The bark brought three others and they all did the same thing — same crouch, same claws, same silent stalking advance.*

*The organism read Marcus before Marcus reached it. Not the hatchet — the approach. The deliberateness. A person walking past doesn't trigger it. A person walking toward it with intent does. The herding posture is a mask. Underneath it the organism is a predator wearing a person like a suit, and it has been reading predator approaches for longer than humans have existed.*

*One-by-one elimination isn't a strategy. You can't sneak up on something that sees you coming. And even if you land the blow — Marcus did — the bark fires before the body falls. Every kill broadcasts your location to every Turned within earshot, and the ones that come aren't herders. They're hunters.*

*The hatchet is boiled. The blood is cleaned. Marcus's vitals are normal. We don't know if that means anything. We don't know if the organism transmits through blood. We don't know a lot of things. What we know is this: the Turned can be killed. They die like people. And the organism has infrastructure-level defense against individual elimination — a defense that turns every kill into a recruitment call for something worse than what you just killed.*

*And afterward, the organism eats its dead. Three Turned knelt beside the body and consumed it over three hours. Methodical. Efficient. What's left is bones. The organism wastes nothing. The dead become calories for the living. The system is closed — self-sustaining, self-fueling, and designed from the ground up to turn every loss into a gain.*

*The organism has thought about this longer than we have.*

# Chapter 14: The Septic Tank

Two days after the pharmacy run I did the stupidest thing I have ever done, and I include in that assessment the full catalogue of stupid things I have done in fifteen years of being a person with bad judgment and worse cardio.

I went scouting. Alone. Without telling anyone.

The reasoning was sound. This is the dangerous thing about bad decisions — they often start with good logic. We needed a map of the surrounding blocks: which houses were occupied by Turned, which were empty, which might have useful supplies. Sienna had been scouting, but Sienna's scouting was instinctive and unstructured — she'd go out, move fast, come back with impressions. I wanted data. Grid squares. Counts. An asset map cross-referenced with the Turned position log I'd been keeping from the steeple. And I wanted to do it myself because I was the one who understood the data, and because — I need to be honest about this — the pharmacy run had made me feel smart. Not competent — *smart.* The PDR research, the medication alternatives, the way I'd walked Dale through the pharmacology while everyone else was celebrating with grape juice. Smart had become a feeling, and the feeling had a trajectory: smart became informed, informed became prepared, prepared became invulnerable. And invulnerable is the most dangerous feeling in the world because it's the one that makes you walk into a house alone at 5:30 AM with a notebook and no exit plan and think *I know what I'm doing.*

Jim and Marcus had walked eight blocks and back. Sienna went to the military interchange. I was the one who hadn't gone anywhere except the steeple, and the distance between "the person who plans" and "the person who acts" had started to feel like an accusation. But that wasn't the real reason. The real reason was vanity — the same vanity that had sent me to the Lyles, the belief that my understanding was superior, dressed up as initiative.

So I went. 5:30 AM, just after dawn. I left a note on the table — "Scouting nearby blocks, back by 8" — which I told myself counted as telling people and which did not count as telling people. I left the walkie-talkie on the charging shelf. If I'd taken it, someone would have heard the click of the charging cradle and woken up and asked where I was going, and I didn't want to be asked because being asked meant being argued with and being argued with meant admitting this was a decision instead of just a thing I was doing.

The first three houses went fine. That's the sentence that should terrify you. "Fine" is the sound confidence makes before it kills you.

I moved slowly. Checked windows. Marked occupancy on a hand-drawn grid in the notebook. House one, Elm Street: empty, front door open, no supplies visible. House two: Turned inside, a man sitting at a kitchen table, staring at the wall, motionless. I watched him through the window for two minutes and he didn't move. House three: empty, pantry stocked — I noted the address for a future supply run.

House four was a ranch-style place on Oak, one story, attached garage, the kind of house that's built for a retired couple who wanted everything on one level. I went through a back window that was already broken — someone had tried to get in or out before me. The glass crunched under my shoes. I noticed the crunch and didn't account for it, because I was feeling competent, and competence is just fear wearing a graduation cap.

Inside: canned food in the pantry. A hand-crank radio on the kitchen counter. A set of tools in the garage. I was loading the backpack I'd brought — one of Marcus's, canvas, military surplus — when I heard the sound.

The drone. Low, vibrating, chest-resonant. The summoning call. Coming from outside, from the front of the house, from everywhere.

I went to the living room window.

Turned were coming. Not from one direction — from every direction. Walking in from the cross streets, emerging from between houses, converging on this house with the methodical precision of a net closing. I counted: five, ten, fifteen. Twenty. Twenty-five. I stopped counting at thirty because my hands were shaking and the binoculars — I'd brought them, I always brought them — were vibrating against my face.

I had made myself a data point. Thirty-plus Turned, converging on a single-story house with plywood-on-nothing walls, and me inside with a backpack full of canned peaches and no exit I'd tested. The organism had detected me — maybe the glass crunching, maybe scent, maybe the collective's pattern recognition flagging a house that had changed state from "empty" to "occupied" — and it had sent the net.

I knew about the density threshold. I'd written about it. I'd warned Craig Lyle about it. And now I was inside the threshold, watching it build in real time, and the distance between understanding a concept and being inside the concept was the distance between reading about drowning and having water in your lungs.

---

The house had no basement. The attic had a pull-down ladder — noisy. The garage had a rolling door — exposed. The back door opened onto a yard that was already filling with Turned coming around the sides of the house. They moved without hurry. They didn't need to hurry. The net was the tactic and the net was already closed.

Behind the backyard, across a chain-link fence, an older property. Overgrown. Weeds waist-high. And in the weeds, barely visible, a concrete disk — a septic tank access port. Decommissioned, probably, judging by the age of the house and the municipal sewer hookup I could see at the property line. The kind of thing you'd miss if you weren't looking for it.

I wasn't looking for it. I saw it.

My brain divided into two processes. Process one: rational analysis, calculating odds, noting that the Turned count was past thirty and climbing and that Moss had said the threshold was density-dependent and a parking lot might hold thirty but a residential lot would not. Process two: animal terror, the deep-brain survival system that doesn't calculate but instead screams *RUN NOW GO NOW MOVE* with a volume that drowns out everything else.

Process two won.

I went out the back door. I ran — thirty yards of gasping, wheezing sprint across the yard. I hit the chain-link fence and went over it with a coordination I did not know I possessed, fueled by the same adrenaline the organism was trying to harvest. I crashed through the weeds. I grabbed the concrete lid of the access port — it weighed maybe forty pounds, and I lifted it like it was cardboard because the body's emergency system has a turbo mode and it doesn't care about your usual limitations. I dropped into the tank.

It was partially drained. Decommissioned. But not empty — there was maybe ten inches of standing waste in the bottom, old and settled and black, and the smell was not a smell but a physical substance, thick and wet and coated, a thing that entered through the nose and the mouth and the pores and became part of you. My shoes sank into it. My stomach convulsed. I pulled the concrete lid back over the opening — scraping, grinding, and then dark, total dark — and I stood in human waste up to my shins in perfect blackness and pressed my hands over my mouth because vomiting is loud and loud is death.

---

Time does things in the dark.

I don't know how long I stood there before the sound changed. Twenty minutes? Thirty? The drone was audible through the concrete — muffled, felt more than heard, a vibration in the bones of the tank and through the soles of my shoes and up into my legs. Then footsteps above. Many footsteps. The collective had reached the house.

The sound that came next is the thing I don't talk about.

A roaring. Not voices — not the human sounds the Turned usually made, the mimicry, the drone. This was structural: wood splitting, glass shattering, something heavy being overturned and overturned again. The ranch house was coming apart. The swarm had hit threshold and the patient herding had collapsed into undirected destruction and the Turned were tearing through the house the way a tornado tears through a mobile home — not aimed, not purposeful, just force. Raw collective force applied to whatever was in reach.

It went on for an hour. Maybe longer. In the dark, in the tank, with the waste soaking through my clothes and the smell destroying my ability to think about anything except not vomiting, I pressed my hands over my ears and counted prime numbers. Two, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-three, twenty-nine. I counted them because they were orderly and because orderly things were the only defense I had against the chaos above me. The primes were reliable. They followed rules. They didn't change their minds or tear through walls or use your mother's voice to lure you outside.

At 89 the primes stopped working.

I don't mean I forgot the sequence. I mean the numbers stopped being a wall and became sounds my mouth made while the rest of me went somewhere else. Because the house above me was being torn apart and I was standing in human waste in the dark and I was fifteen years old and I was going to die here and nobody knew where I was because I'd left a *note* — a note — and the terror that had been background noise suddenly wasn't background anymore. It was the only signal. It filled the tank the way the waste filled my shoes and I couldn't count around it the way you can't breathe around water.

My heart was hammering. Not the managed rhythm Jim had taught, not the four-in-hold-six-out, but the runaway cascade — 140, 150, higher, the kind of heart rate that exists for one biological purpose, which is to fuel a sprint, and I couldn't sprint because I was in a concrete box four feet wide and if I pushed the lid off and ran they would tear me apart the way they were tearing the house apart and that thought — the image of it, the sound of it translated to my body — pushed the rate higher and the rate pushing higher made the fear worse and the fear made the rate worse and I understood in a way I hadn't before that this was the loop, this was the mechanism, this was how the organism won. Not by catching you. By letting your own chemistry do the catching.

Then the warmth came.

It started in my chest. A spreading heat, not unpleasant — not the burn of exertion but something softer, like a muscle unclenching that you didn't know was clenched. It moved outward through my arms, into my hands, up through my throat and into the base of my skull. My hands stopped shaking. My jaw unclenched. For a fraction of a second it felt like relief and that was the most terrifying part — that the thing trying to unmake me felt *good.*

The edges of me went soft. I can't describe it better than that. The parts that were Nate — the name, the weight, the self-consciousness, the mother I was trying not to think about — started to feel like things I was holding instead of things I was. Like I could set them down. Like there was a surface somewhere in the dark where I could place them carefully, the way the garden woman had placed her shoes on the curb, and walk away lighter. The organism wasn't attacking. It was *inviting.* It was the gentlest thing I'd ever felt and it was dissolving me.

I had maybe seconds. I knew this the way you know you're falling before you hit — not because you calculate the distance but because your body tells you in a language older than math. The prime numbers were gone. Jim's breathing was gone. The analytical framework I'd built my entire identity around was tissue paper and the warmth was burning through it and behind the warmth was something vast and patient and utterly without malice, and the absence of malice was the worst part because you can't fight something that isn't fighting you.

So I did the only thing I could think of. I dropped my hands from my ears, bent down, and shoved my face into the waste.

Not metaphorically. Not a splash. I plunged both hands into the black standing sewage at the bottom of the tank and brought them up to my face and pressed the filth against my nose and mouth and breathed in — a full, deliberate, gasping inhalation of the most revolting substance I had ever encountered. The smell hit my brainstem like a fist. My stomach convulsed so violently that I doubled over. My eyes flooded. I gagged, retched, retched again, the reflex so total and so involuntary that every other signal in my body — the warmth, the invitation, the gentle dissolution — was obliterated by the sheer biological imperative of *revulsion.*

The warmth shattered. The softness at my edges snapped back into hardness. I was Nate again — Nate in a septic tank, Nate covered in filth, Nate retching in the dark with sewage on his face and tears streaming from his eyes, but *Nate.* The organism's frequency or invitation or whatever it had been couldn't compete with the body's oldest and most violent reflex. Disgust is older than fear. Disgust is the immune system's scream, the body's first and most primitive rejection, and it doesn't negotiate and it doesn't dissolve and it will not be gently invited to stop. I had found the one feeling more powerful than terror: the body's absolute refusal to accept contamination.

I was shaking. I was crying. I was wiping sewage from my face with the sleeve of a shirt already soaked in sewage, which accomplished nothing except smearing it around, and I was laughing — not the good kind, not Sienna's reboot-laugh, but the high thin laugh of a person who has just done something so disgusting and so desperate and so *effective* that the only response left is the sound your brain makes when it can't process what you've done.

I started the primes again. From 2. The numbers came back. Two, three, five, seven. The walls of the tank were solid. The dark was just dark. I counted, and this time the counting held, because behind the counting was the taste of sewage and behind the taste was the knowledge that I had been *that close* — seconds, maybe less — and the knowledge was a better wall than any prime number because it was made of fear I could use. Not the runaway fear the organism harvested but the cold, clenched, purposeful fear of a person who has seen the edge and will do anything — literally anything, including shoving his face into human waste — to not go back.

I got to 547 before the sounds stopped. I don't know if 547 is prime. I think it is. I never checked. It doesn't matter. What matters is that by the time the destruction ended I had been standing in a septic tank for approximately three hours and my legs had gone numb and my hands were shaking so badly I couldn't have held the binoculars if I'd had them and my entire body was coated in a film of waste that I could feel on my skin like a second layer of something that was not me.

The frenzy burned out. Moss had described this in a fragment Marcus caught — the swarm's feedback loop was self-limiting. The collective violence escalated to a peak and then the signal scattered, the coordination broke, and the Turned dispersed in ones and twos, dazed, almost confused, like people waking from a blackout they couldn't remember. The footsteps above thinned. The drone faded. Silence — not the held-breath silence of the early days but a deeper silence, the silence of aftermath.

I waited. I waited until it was fully dark — hours after the last sound, hours of standing in the tank in the blackness with nothing to do but exist inside the consequences of my own confidence. Then I pushed the lid. It scraped. The night air hit me and I breathed it and it was the best breath I have ever taken and it was immediately followed by the worst, because the second breath carried my own smell back to me and I understood for the first time the full dimension of what I had done and what I was covered in and what I smelled like and I leaned over and vomited into the weeds and it didn't matter because nothing I produced could be worse than what was already on me.

I walked back to the church. In the dark. By memory. Moving slow, step by step, through streets I'd mapped from the steeple but had never walked at night. The Turned were in their positions but scattered thin — the post-frenzy dispersal. None approached. I don't know if this was because I was moving slowly or because I smelled like a septic tank and even the Turned had standards.

---

Sienna was at the side door.

She'd been there for hours. I could see it — the puffiness around her eyes, the rigid set of her jaw, the posture of a person who has been standing in one place holding themselves together through an act of will that has nothing left to hold. She'd thought I was dead. She'd heard the swarm from the church — everyone had — and she'd thought I was inside it.

She saw me. She smelled me. Her face did something complicated and fast — relief, then fury, then something else that I couldn't name.

"Oh my God, Nate. Oh my *God.*"

I walked past her. I couldn't talk. Not because I was choosing not to — because the machinery of speech had been offline for six hours and I didn't know how to restart it. I went to the rain barrel behind the church and tipped it over myself. The water was cold and it wasn't enough — not nearly enough — but it ran over me and carried some of the waste away and I stood there in the dark while the water ran out and Sienna stood three feet away not touching me and not leaving.

"I thought you were dead," she said. Her voice was level. The level voice was worse than screaming would have been. "I thought you were inside that house when they tore it apart. I heard it. We all heard it. Ruth was praying. Dale stopped carving. Maria started counting the food supply because that's what Maria does when she thinks someone's died — she recalculates. And I stood at this door for six hours and I didn't know if you were dead or turned or —"

"I was in a septic tank."

Silence.

"A septic —"

"A decommissioned septic tank behind the property east of the house. I dropped in and pulled the lid over and stood in it while they tore the house apart."

Another silence. Longer.

"You stood in a septic tank."

"For approximately six hours. Yes."

She stared at me. The moonlight caught her face and I watched her process this — the horror, the absurdity, the specific lunacy of a fifteen-year-old boy standing waist-deep in sewage in the dark counting prime numbers while the world destroyed itself above him — and something in her expression broke and the break was not grief and was not fury. She laughed.

It was short. One breath. More of a bark than a laugh. But it was real, and it was the first time I'd heard anyone laugh since before the Turned, and the sound of it cracked something in my chest that had been sealed shut for days.

"It's not funny," I said.

"It's a little funny."

"I was standing in human waste."

"And you survived. That's —" She stopped laughing. Her eyes were wet. "That's the most you thing possible. Everyone else would have fought or run or frozen. You hid in a toilet."

"It wasn't a toilet. It was a septic —"

"Nate. Shut up. Come inside." She paused. "Actually, don't come inside. You can't come inside smelling like that. Jim has church donation clothes in the office. I'll get them. Burn what you're wearing."

She went inside. I stood by the empty rain barrel in church-donation boxers and no shirt, shivering, holding my ruined clothes in a wad. When she came back with a pair of too-large khakis and a polo shirt that said ROTARY CLUB — DOVER CHAPTER on the chest, she handed them to me without looking and went back inside and I stood in the dark and got dressed and tried to feel something other than ashamed and failed.

---

I sat in the basement. My hands were still shaking. Jim had given me coffee — the last of the instant, reheated over a candle, terrible — and Ruth had looked at me once and said "You're an idiot" and gone back upstairs and that was Ruth's version of "I'm glad you're alive" and I understood the translation.

I opened the notebook. The pages were wrinkled — the notebook had been in my back pocket in the tank — and they smelled. Everything smelled. I would smell for days. The smell would become a joke and then a reference point and then a unit of measurement. Sienna would later say, during a particularly bad stretch of the trail, "This is about 0.6 septic tanks," and everyone would know exactly what she meant.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #9:**

*Lessons:*

*(1) Never go alone. I wrote this after Henderson's trailer. I didn't follow it. The lesson doesn't work if you don't follow it.*

*(2) Always have an exit you've already tested. I went into a house I'd never been in through a window I'd never used and my only exit was a septic tank I found by luck. Luck is not a strategy.*

*(3) The swarm threshold is real. It's not a concept. It's the sound of a house being torn apart by thirty human bodies moving in coordinated frenzy with no self-preservation and no off switch. You cannot calm your way through it. You can only not be there when it happens.*

*(4) Confidence is the thing that nearly killed me. Not fear — confidence. I went because the pharmacy run worked and because working made me feel like I knew what I was doing and knowing what you're doing is the most dangerous feeling in the world because it makes you forget that the world doesn't care what you know.*

*(5) I almost turned. In the tank. The panic broke through the counting and I felt it — the warmth, the dissolving, the invitation. The organism doesn't fight you. It opens a door and waits. I stopped it by shoving my face into the waste and breathing in, because disgust is older than fear and the body's revulsion reflex overrides everything else. This is not a technique I can recommend. This is not a technique at all. It's what happens when a fifteen-year-old is out of options and discovers that the most disgusting thing in reach is also the only thing that can save him.*

*(6) If your only option is a septic tank, take the septic tank. You will hate yourself but you will be alive to hate yourself and alive is the prerequisite for everything else.*

*(7) Tell people where you're going. Take the radio. I left a note and left the walkie-talkie on the shelf because taking it meant someone would know and knowing meant arguing and arguing meant admitting I'd made a choice. A note is cowardice in written form. A radio left behind is cowardice in silence. If I'd had the radio, someone in the steeple could have warned me about the convergence. If I'd told someone, they'd have talked me out of going alone. Sienna stood at the door for six hours thinking I was dead and that is worse than the septic tank and worse than the swarm and worse than anything I've done in my life.*

*(8) Sienna laughed. In the middle of the worst night of my life, while I was standing in the dark covered in sewage, she laughed. It was the first laugh since before the Turned. I think laughter might be a survival tool. Not because it's calming — it's not, it spikes the heart rate — but because it's the sound the brain makes when it encounters something so far outside its model that the only response is to reboot. She rebooted. I needed it more than I needed the rain barrel.*

I slept that night. I didn't mean to — I'd planned to stay awake, stay in the steeple, make up for the hours I'd cost the group. But the body overrules the plan. I fell asleep on the pew in the basement, still smelling like the tank despite two more washings, and I dreamed of the dark.

Not the septic tank. Something larger. An infinite version of the same space — no walls, no lid, no bottom. Just dark, extending in every direction, and somewhere above me the sound of the house being torn apart. Not close. Not approaching. Just constant, like weather. The tearing was the texture of the world. And I was standing in it with my hands at my sides and I couldn't move, not because I was frozen but because there was nowhere to move *to*. Every direction was the same dark. Every step would land in the same place.

I woke with my fists clenched so hard that my palms were marked with crescent moons from my fingernails. Four deep impressions in each hand, the skin white and then flushing red. For a disoriented second I thought my fingers were pruned — waterlogged — and the tank rushed back and my heart spiked and I pressed my thumb against my wrist and counted. The count took longer than usual. The dream didn't want to let go.

---

The next morning Sienna came to the steeple while I was on watch. She sat down across from me and didn't say anything for a long time. I knew this silence — it was the one she used when she was choosing words, which meant the words were going to matter.

"You keep doing this thing," she said.

"Which thing? I do a lot of things. Most of them badly."

"That. That right there. The joke. The *I'm just a fat kid in a steeple* routine. You did it before the septic tank too — 'I'm the strategy kid, not the action kid.' You said it like it was a joke. Then you went alone into a house full of Turned because nobody expected you to actually *do* anything, because you'd already told everyone not to expect it."

I didn't say anything because she was right and I didn't have a joke for that.

"The note," she said. "You left a note because you didn't want anyone to argue with you. Because if someone argued, you'd have to defend the decision, and defending it would mean admitting you'd *made* a decision, and making decisions is the thing you keep telling yourself you can't do because you're fifteen and overweight and you get winded on stairs."

"I do get winded on stairs."

"Everyone gets winded on stairs, Nate. The stairs aren't the point." She leaned forward. "The point is you keep building this case — this really smart, really funny, really airtight case — for why you can't be responsible for anything. And as long as nothing is your responsibility, nothing is your fault. And as long as nothing is your fault, you never have to sit with the fact that you could have done better. It's perfect. It's the perfect defense. And it's going to get someone killed."

The binoculars were in my hands and I was gripping them hard enough that the rubber eyepieces were deforming.

"I went into that house," I said. "I made a decision. I —"

"You went into that house and left a *note*. That's not a decision. That's running away with documentation." She paused. "You're the smartest person I've ever met. You see things nobody else sees. But you use the smart to build reasons why you can't act, instead of plans for how to act better. And I'm telling you this because —" Her voice changed. Went quieter. "Because the next time you go alone and leave a note, I might not be standing at the door when you come back. And you need to decide whether that matters to you more than being right about your own limitations."

She went downstairs. I sat in the steeple and looked through the binoculars and didn't see anything because my eyes were blurring and I told myself it was the cold air and it wasn't the cold air.

# Chapter 15: Sienna Runs

On Day 18, Sienna did the bravest and stupidest thing I have ever witnessed, and I am including the septic tank in that assessment because at least the septic tank only risked my own life.

I was in the basement inventorying the pharmacy haul when she came down the stairs from the steeple moving faster than I'd ever seen her move indoors.

"There's a kid," she said. "Two blocks south. In a yard. Alone. Crying."

The basement went still. Jim looked up from his Bible. Dale's knife paused. Maria, at the pantry, turned around.

"How old?" Jim asked.

"Young. Six, seven. A boy. He's sitting in the yard of that yellow house on Birch — the one with the swing set. He's just *sitting there,* and there are Turned on the next block and he's *crying,* Jim, he's crying and they're going to find him."

I was already moving to the stairs. "Let me see."

In the steeple, through the binoculars, I found him. A small figure in the yard of a yellow clapboard house — sitting in the grass next to a swing set, knees to his chest, rocking. I couldn't hear the crying from this distance but I could see it in his body: the shaking, the way his head dropped and lifted, the convulsive rhythm of a child who has been alone too long and has reached the end of whatever reserves a seven-year-old has.

Three Turned were visible on Birch Street. One block south of the child. Walking slowly, drifting, their standard patrol. They hadn't oriented toward him yet, but the crying — even at distance, even muffled by the glass of the steeple — was a sound that carried, and if I could see him from here, the Turned's network would register him soon. Crying is fear made audible. The organism would hear it the way a shark hears blood.

"We need to get him," Sienna said. She was behind me on the stairs, and her voice had a quality I hadn't heard before — an urgency that wasn't tactical. It was visceral. Primal. The voice of someone for whom this was not a strategic calculation.

"We need to think about —"

"He's seven, Nate. He's Jaylen's age. He's sitting in a yard *crying* and there are three of them one block away and if we don't go now —"

"If we go now without a plan, we risk —"

"Then I go." She was past me on the stairs, moving down. "I go alone. I'm fast. I can get there and back in four minutes."

"Sienna, *stop.*"

She stopped. Not because I said it with authority — I didn't have authority, I had a notebook and a history of hiding in septic tanks. She stopped because something in my voice caught her, the same way her hand on my elbow caught me during the crossing. A snag in the momentum.

"Running is the thing that kills people," I said. "You know this. You watched the soldiers. You told me yourself — the sergeant who stopped fighting was the one who survived. If you run two blocks, your heart rate goes to 160, 170, and you're carrying a crying child, and your adrenaline is spiking because of his fear and your fear feeding each other, and —"

"I know the mechanism, Nate."

"Then you know running is —"

"I know." Her eyes were bright. Not tears — intensity. The look of a person who understands exactly what they're about to do and has decided to do it anyway. "I'm not going to let a seven-year-old die because I'm managing my heart rate. That's not — I can't. I know the math. I know the risk. And I can't."

Jim was at the bottom of the stairs. He'd heard everything. He looked at Sienna and something passed between them — a recognition, an understanding that transcended the tactical framework. Jim, who had put the sign in the window. Jim, who had made coffee. Jim, who had done the right thing for the wrong reason and saved lives by the act of opening a door. He recognized what Sienna was doing because it was what he'd been doing for two weeks, and the fact that the organism punished it didn't make it wrong.

"Go," Jim said. "Walk as far as you can. Run only if you have to. And Nate —" He looked at me. "Watch. Guide her back."

Sienna took the walkie-talkie from the charging shelf. Jim took the other. He didn't go to the steeple — he stayed on the ground floor, near the side door, because someone needed to be ready to open it fast and someone needed to be in the steeple, and I was already moving up the stairs.

---

I watched from the steeple. The walkie-talkie was in my left hand, the binoculars in my right.

Sienna left through the side door. She moved south on the residential streets, fast-walking — not running, not yet, but moving at the limit of walking speed, her athlete's body covering ground efficiently. Her posture was controlled. Her arms were at her sides. She was doing everything right.

Block one. Two Turned in a yard to the west.

"Two in the yard to your left," I radioed. "They're tracking but not moving. Keep your pace."

They tracked her — the head-turn. Didn't approach. She was moving fast but not panicking. The blood pressure cuff was on her wrist; I could see her glancing at it. Managing. Measuring. The runner who couldn't run, calculating her pace against her chemistry.

She reached Birch Street. The yellow house was there. The child was there — still in the yard, still rocking. From this angle, closer now, I could see his face: dark hair, light skin, streaked with dirt and tears. Seven, maybe six. Wearing pajamas and one shoe. He'd been alone for days — you could see it in the way he held himself, the fetal curl, the complete abdication of the vigilance that even children maintain when they believe someone is coming. He'd stopped believing.

Sienna approached him. Slowly. She crouched down. She was talking to him — I couldn't hear the words. The child looked up. His face changed — the blank despair breaking into something raw and desperate, the face of a drowning person seeing a hand.

He reached for her. She picked him up.

And the three Turned on the next block turned toward them.

---

Here is what I saw from the steeple and what I did about it.

I saw Sienna pick up the child. I saw the child clutch her neck and press his face against her shoulder and I saw his body convulse with sobs — real sobs, the kind that shake the whole frame — and I saw the sound of those sobs ripple outward like a stone dropped in water because the three Turned on the south end of Birch had stopped drifting and were walking toward the yellow house with a purpose that wasn't their standard patrol.

I keyed the radio. "Three incoming from the south. Moving with purpose. You need to go now."

I saw Sienna stand. I saw her assess — the child on her hip, the Turned incoming, the two blocks back to the church. I saw the moment she made the calculation and the moment the calculation said *run.*

She ran.

She ran the way she was built to run — long stride, balanced, the biomechanics of a girl who'd trained for the 400-meter since she was twelve. Even carrying a child, even with the wrong shoes and the cracked asphalt and the two blocks of residential street between her and safety, she was fast. She covered the first block in maybe forty seconds.

"Jim, she's running. One block out, coming fast. Get the door."

Through the binoculars I watched her face. Her mouth was open. Her chest was heaving. And her expression was the thing I'd been afraid of — not fear but something beyond fear, the expression of a person whose body is doing the thing the organism needs. I could see the flush climbing her neck and her jawline, the exertion and the adrenaline merging into a single biochemical signal, and the Turned behind her were closing — not running, they never ran, but more of them now, emerging from between houses, drawn by the sound of crying and the scent of terror, five, six, seven.

"Seven behind her. Converging from side streets. She's fast but they're drawn by the kid's screaming."

The child was screaming. Not words — a continuous wail, the sound of a child who has been alone for days and has been picked up by a stranger and is being carried at a sprint through a world that has stopped making sense. The sound carried. Every Turned in a two-block radius was orienting toward it.

Sienna reached the church's block. Fifty yards to the side door.

"Fifty yards, Jim. Door open. She's coming in hot." She was sprinting flat out and the child was screaming and behind her the Turned were converging and I could see — through the binoculars, at magnification, in the kind of detail I didn't want — the moment something changed in her stride.

A hitch. A falter. Not fatigue — something else. Her right foot caught the asphalt wrong and she stumbled half a step and caught herself and kept running but the stumble wasn't physical. I'd seen her run before, watched her do laps around the church yard in the mornings when she thought no one was watching. She didn't stumble. She was too good, too trained, too controlled. The stumble came from inside — a disruption in the signal between brain and body, a glitch in the operating system.

She was at the edge.

She described it to me later — the warmth. A spreading heat that started in her chest and moved outward, into her arms, her face, her skull. A buzzing, subsonic, like the drone the Turned made but from inside, from the base of her brain stem, vibrating through the bones of her skull. A feeling of the self loosening — not pain, not fear, but a slackening, as if the thing that held "Sienna" together was being gently, patiently, pulled apart from the inside. The organism finding the gap between body and identity and pressing into it.

She was twenty yards from the door.

Jim had the door open. He was standing in the threshold with his arms out, the posture of a man catching something falling. Sienna crossed the parking lot. The child was screaming. She was running. The Turned were fifteen yards behind — close enough that I could see their faces through the binoculars, the smooth blankness, the absence of expression that was its own kind of expression.

She made it through the door.

Jim slammed it shut. I heard the bolt. From the steeple, two floors up, I heard the bolt engage and I heard Sienna hit the floor — not fall, collapse, the controlled descent of a body that has been pushed past its limit and is shutting down to protect itself.

Then I heard something else. A sound I couldn't identify — sharp, flat, like a book being slapped against a table. Then silence. Then the child crying again, but differently now, a scared cry instead of a desperate one. Then Jim's voice, low and urgent, words I couldn't make out from two floors up.

I watched the Turned arrive at the door. Seven of them. They stood in the parking lot. They didn't try the door. Below threshold — seven wasn't enough for the frenzy. They stood and they waited and after forty minutes they drifted away.

---

I came downstairs.

Sienna was on the basement floor. Ruth had a blanket over her. The child — later we'd learn his name was Caleb, Caleb Reeves, seven years old, from the yellow house on Birch, parents gone since Day 2 — was in Maria's arms, not Jim's. That was the first thing I noticed. The second thing was the bruise.

It was on Sienna's left jaw, below the ear. Fresh — the skin darkening from red to purple, the swelling just starting. The kind of bruise that comes from a closed fist, not a fall. I looked at it and then I looked at Jim and Jim was sitting in a pew with his hands between his knees, staring at the floor, and his right hand was wrapped in a wet cloth and he was holding it the way you hold something that has betrayed you.

Dale told me later. In pieces, the way Dale told everything — carved out slowly, the details emerging one at a time.

Sienna had come through the door and collapsed and Jim had caught her and the child, and Sienna was on the floor and she was safe and it should have been over. But it wasn't over. Her heart rate wasn't coming down. The sprint, the child's screaming, the Turned fifteen yards behind her — the adrenaline had momentum and being inside the church didn't stop the chemistry the way slamming a door stops a pursuer. She was on the floor and her eyes were wrong. Not closed — open, but unfocused, the pupils blown wide, and she was making a sound that wasn't words and wasn't the drone but was somewhere between them, a low continuous moan that Dale said made the hair on his arms stand up because it sounded like the beginning of something.

Jim had knelt beside her. He'd taken her face in his hands. He'd said her name — "Sienna. Sienna, look at me. You're safe. You're in the church. Sienna." And she'd looked at him but the look wasn't recognition. It was the blank, smooth, unfocused gaze of someone whose self was leaving the building.

"Her skin was hot," Dale said. "Jim touched her face and jerked back like he'd touched a stove. And her color — you could see it. Not green, not yet, but wrong. Flushed past red into something that didn't have a name. Like sunburn but from the inside."

Jim made the decision in less than a second. Dale said he didn't hesitate, didn't warn her, didn't wind up. He just closed his fist and hit her — a short, sharp blow to the jaw, the kind of punch that comes from someone who learned to fight fifty years ago and has spent every year since choosing not to. Sienna's head snapped sideways. Her eyes rolled back. She went limp.

The moan stopped.

Maria was already there with the blood pressure cuff. She'd strapped it on before Jim's hand had unclenched. "142 over 95," she said. Then thirty seconds later: "138 over 92." Then: "It's coming down. It's coming down."

Jim hadn't moved. He was kneeling beside an unconscious eighteen-year-old girl he'd just hit in the face, and his hand was shaking — not fear-shaking, not the kind the organism produces, but the deep tremor of a man whose body was rejecting what his brain had decided to do. Ruth brought him the wet cloth without being asked. He wrapped his hand and sat in the pew and didn't speak.

Sienna came to about four minutes later. Confused, disoriented, the bruise already spreading. Jim told her what he'd done before she could ask. "I hit you," he said. "You were past the breathing. You were past your name. I hit you because I didn't know another way to stop it and I am sorry and I would do it again."

She'd looked at him for a long time. Then she'd said, "Good."

That was it. Good. Not *thank you* and not *it's okay* and not *I forgive you.* Good. The word of a person who understood exactly what had almost happened and who was grateful to be conscious and bruised and alive and still herself, and who knew that the man sitting across from her with his wrapped hand and his wet eyes had done the hardest thing anyone had done since the world ended — not the punch, which was mechanics, but the decision, which was everything.

Jim was still in the pew. He didn't look up. Ruth was beside him but not touching him, the same way I would later sit beside Sienna — present, not intruding. The group had rearranged itself around the event the way water rearranges around a stone: Dale carving, Maria counting, Ruth attending, Jim sitting with the weight of what saving someone's life cost when saving it looked like violence.

Sienna's hands were shaking. Not the small tremor Marcus had shown during the pharmacy run — a full-body vibration, deep, the kind that starts in the core and radiates outward. She was wrapped in the blanket and shaking inside it and her eyes were closed and her face was wet and the bruise on her jaw was a dark purple now, vivid against her brown skin, and she was breathing in the pattern Jim had taught — four in, hold, six out — but the pattern was ragged, broken by the shaking, the breathing of a person who was holding herself together with technique because everything else had failed.

I sat next to her. On the floor. Not touching. Present.

"I felt it," she said. Eyes still closed. "The edge. I know where it is now."

"You came back."

"Barely." A breath. "It's not a line, Nate. It's not a threshold you cross. It's — it's a dissolving. You start to come apart. Not all at once. The edges go first. The parts of you that are optional — your name, your history, your preferences. They start to feel like clothes you're wearing instead of skin. And the thing that's dissolving them isn't violent. It's gentle. It's the most terrifying thing about it. It feels like being invited to stop being yourself. Like the organism is saying, 'You can put this down now. You can stop carrying all of this. Just let go.'"

I didn't say anything. I knew exactly what she meant — the warmth, the invitation, the gentle loosening of the self — and I didn't say so because the septic tank was mine to carry and hers was hers and naming the overlap wouldn't help either of us. I sat next to her and said nothing because there was nothing to say that wouldn't be insufficient.

"I almost did," she whispered. "For half a second. I almost let go. Not because I wanted to turn. Because I was so tired of being afraid and it was offering me a way to stop. And the only reason I didn't is that Caleb was in my arms and if I let go he'd fall."

She opened her eyes. They were red. She looked at me.

"You were watching."

"From the steeple. Yes."

"I heard you. On the radio. The whole time." A pause. "Three incoming from the south. She's coming in hot." She said it in my voice — flat, steady, the voice I'd used because steady voices keep other people steady and because controlling the voice was the only thing I could control. "You got Jim to the door."

"Yes."

"And you stayed in the steeple."

"Jim told me —"

"I know what Jim told you. And I know you guided me back and I know you called the Turned count and I know you got the door open. I'm not asking what you did with the radio. I'm asking what you would have done if the radio wasn't enough."

I didn't answer. The answer was: I don't know. From a safe distance, through binoculars, I'd guided the person I — I'd guided Sienna through two blocks of converging Turned, and I'd gotten Jim to the door, and none of it was nothing. But she wasn't asking about the radio. She was asking whether I'd have come down the stairs and run into the street and done the thing that might have killed us both, and I didn't know and the not-knowing was worse than knowing I was a coward because at least a coward has made a decision.

"You did the right thing," she said. "Staying. Watching. Not following. If you'd come after me, I'd have had to worry about you, and worrying about you would have pushed me over. You staying put kept me below the line."

"That's rational."

"It's also true. Are you going to accept it or are you going to punish yourself?"

"Both, probably."

She almost smiled. Almost. The ghost of the laugh she'd given me after the septic tank — the sound of a brain encountering something outside its model. Then the almost-smile faded and she closed her eyes again and the shaking continued and I sat next to her and didn't touch her and the not-touching was its own kind of contact, the way silence between two people who understand each other is its own kind of conversation.

Caleb was asleep in Maria's lap — she'd taken him when Jim couldn't hold anything anymore, and the boy had curled against her with the instinct of a child who doesn't care whose arms they are as long as arms exist. Seven years old. Pajamas and one shoe. He'd survived for days alone in a house where his parents had turned, hiding under his bed, drinking water from the bathroom tap, eating cereal from the box. He'd come outside because he couldn't stand being alone anymore, and the not-standing-it had been louder than the fear, and that was why he was crying in the yard — not because he was afraid but because he was choosing to not be alone even if not being alone meant dying.

Seven years old and he'd made a choice that most adults couldn't make. Sienna had honored that choice by running. I had honored it by not running. And the organism had learned — because it was always learning — that the small, crying ones could draw the fast, brave ones into range.

I didn't write this last thought in the journal. Some observations are too ugly to record.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #10:**

*Sienna almost turned today saving a kid. She did the right thing and it almost killed her — not killed her, worse than killed her. Killed is an ending. Turning is a continuation in a form that uses your face and your voice and your memories to hunt the people you loved.*

*I guided her from the steeple. Called the Turned positions, warned her when the three oriented, got Jim to the door. It wasn't nothing. I keep telling myself it wasn't nothing because "nothing" is the word that fits the shape of what it felt like, and the radio doesn't change the shape. The safe thing. The smart thing. The thing the mechanism demanded. Sienna says I kept her below the line by staying put. I believe her. And it was also the cowardly thing and I don't know if those are different things anymore.*

*The Turned don't punish bad people. They punish brave ones. They punish the ones who run toward the crying. They punish the instinct that makes humans human — the impulse to help, to connect, to risk yourself for someone else. The organism has designed a world where kindness is a death sentence and selfishness is a survival strategy. I don't know what kind of world that is. I don't know what kind of person survives it. I'm afraid the answer is: my kind. The kind who guides from a distance. The kind who calculates. The kind who stays in the steeple with a radio and calls it "enough."*

*Caleb is seven. He's asleep in Maria's lap. Jim is in a pew with a wet cloth around his hand because he punched an eighteen-year-old girl in the face to keep her from turning, and the punch worked and the cloth is for the shaking, not the knuckles. Dale is carving Caleb a dinosaur because Sienna asked him to and Dale would carve anything Sienna asked him to because everyone would do anything Sienna asked them to because she is the person who ran toward the crying while the rest of us watched from windows.*

*Eight people now. Fifteen days of food at current rationing. The cost of doing the right thing is 1.3 days. Maria was right about the arithmetic. She's always right about the arithmetic. The arithmetic is not the point.*

That evening I found Jim on the church steps. He was sitting on the concrete with his wrapped hand in his lap, looking at the parking lot where the Turned stood in their positions. The bruise on Sienna's jaw was upstairs. The hatchet blood was in the boiling pot. The two events — the punch and the kill — were sitting in Jim's body like stones, and I could see them in the slope of his shoulders.

I sat next to him. The concrete was cold.

"That was Gary Sutton," he said. Not looking at me. Looking at the lot. "The one Marcus killed. He coached Little League for fifteen years. Taught those boys to throw a curveball."

I didn't say anything. I waited.

"I watched him for three days before Marcus went out there. His hands." Jim raised his right arm, miming a motion — the wrist snap of a sidearm throw, repeated, mechanical. "Over and over. The same pitch. The organism is using his hands to repeat the motion because it's stored in his muscles, in his motor cortex, in the part of him that learned it so deeply it became automatic."

"Or the organism is just replaying a motor loop," I said. "The way a record plays a groove. It doesn't mean Gary was experiencing it."

"Tom Hadley conducts the choir. Gary threw curveballs. Pembrook stands at his mailbox. Every one of them is doing something they did when they were people. You don't think that means anything?"

"I think it means the organism has access to procedural memory. Motor patterns. Muscle memory. That's not the same as consciousness, Jim. A recording of a person isn't a person."

"At what point does the recording stop being the person?" He looked at me now. His eyes were red from the day and from the night and from the punch. "If I played you a recording of your mother's voice — her actual voice, saying something she actually said — would you tell me there's no part of her in that recording?"

The question landed wrong. He knew it landed wrong. He didn't apologize because the question wasn't about apology. It was about the line between a person and the residue of a person, and he was asking me to tell him where that line was because he'd just punched an eighteen-year-old girl to keep her on one side of it and a man he'd served coffee to had just killed a man who might have been on the other side of it and Jim needed to know — needed someone to tell him — that those two acts weren't the same thing.

"At what point does running on a loop stop being human?" I said.

Jim was quiet for a long time. The Turned swayed in the lot. Tom Hadley's hand twitched — the conducting motion, brief, automatic. Gary Sutton was gone. His position in the lot was empty. What Marcus had left on the gravel was bones now — scattered, picked clean, the durable architecture of a human being stripped of everything the organism could use. The organism disposed of its dead by consuming them. Jim had watched that too.

"At what point does killing someone who can't fight back stop being murder?" Jim said.

Neither of us won. Neither of us tried to. We sat on the church steps in the cold and watched the Turned repeat their loops and we held two positions that couldn't both be right and might both be true, and the space between them was the space where every hard decision in the next three weeks would live.

Jim stood up. He put his good hand on my shoulder.

"I don't know the answer," he said. "But I trust you to keep asking the question. Even when the answer scares you. Especially then."

He went inside. I stayed on the steps until the cold drove me in.

The next morning Ruth brought me tea — chamomile, from a box she'd found in the church kitchen, brewed over a candle. She sat across from me at the folding table and sipped hers and said nothing for a while, which was unusual for Ruth, who generally said things the way other people breathed — constantly and with conviction.

"I dream about Leonard," she said. Not looking at me. Looking at the tea. "Every night since this started. He's standing in the yard. Our yard, the house on Poplar Street. He's wearing his work clothes — the blue Dickies, the boots with the left heel worn down. And I know he's turned. In the dream, I know. His face is smooth and his posture is wrong and he's standing in the garden where he grew tomatoes for forty years, and he's one of them."

She sipped her tea.

"The worst part isn't seeing him. The worst part is that I'm *relieved* he's already dead." She said this calmly, the way she said everything — with the precision of a woman who'd spent thirty-nine years choosing words for a living. "He died in 2019. Heart attack on a job site. And every night I dream that he's turned, and every night I wake up relieved that the heart attack got him first, and the relief is — it's obscene, Nate. Being grateful that your husband died before the world ended. Being grateful that he's in a cemetery and not standing in a parking lot with a smooth face."

She set her cup down.

"I'm telling you this because you think you're the only one who doesn't sleep. You're not. None of us sleep. We just don't talk about it because talking about it means admitting that the things we carry at night are the things we can't carry during the day, and during the day we have to function." She stood. "Your tea is getting cold. Drink it. Chamomile is good for anxiety and it's better than that dreadful instant coffee."

She went upstairs. I drank the tea and wrote what she'd told me in the notebook and underlined *none of us sleep* because it was the truest thing anyone had said to me in weeks.
