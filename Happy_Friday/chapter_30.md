# Chapter 30: The Journal

Day 45.

I sat on the roof of the science building at dusk. The frequency emitter hummed behind me — its speakers and antenna array mounted on the parapet, the sound so constant it had become the texture of the air. You didn't get used to it. You learned to carry it.

The campus spread below me in the last light. The quad, the dormitories, the track, the maintenance bay. The buildings were brick and limestone and they glowed in the dusk the way old buildings glow — warm, patient, as if they'd been waiting for someone to use them again.

Below, in the quad, Sienna was running laps. Controlled. Steady. Her breathing measured, her stride long, the mechanics of a body reclaiming itself from the thing that had tried to take it. She ran toward the edge and turned back. Toward and back. Each lap she pushed closer to the edge and came back, and the margin in her favor was growing.

Caleb was on the steps of the education building with Jim. They were counting breaths. Four in. Hold. Six out. Caleb's small chest rising and falling with the careful concentration of a child who trusted the man beside him. Jim's hand was on the boy's shoulder. His other hand was on the railing, supporting weight he used to carry unassisted. He didn't let Caleb see this. Caleb saw anyway. Children see everything. They just don't always say.

Marcus was under the hood of the truck. The wrench was steady, rhythmic. For the first time in years, he was building something instead of enduring something. The truck might run someday. It might not. 

Ruth was in the library. I couldn't see her from the roof but I knew she was there because the library lights were on and Ruth's schedule was as predictable as her grammar: mornings for reading, afternoons for the project she wouldn't describe, evenings for telling everyone their syntax was deteriorating. The standards persisted. Civilization was negotiable. Subject-verb agreement was not.

Dale was on the bench outside the science building, carving. The zoo had grown — beagle, cardinal, fox, turtle, owl, and now something new, something I couldn't identify from the roof but which Dale would later tell me was a dome. A geodesic dome, like the ones Buckminster Fuller designed. "Strongest structure in nature," he said. "All the force distributed evenly. Nothing carries more than its share." He'd carved it for Caleb. Caleb put it in the center of the zoo and called it the animals' house.

Maria was at the whiteboard in the cafeteria, updating the supply calendar. She would always be at the whiteboard. The counting was her prayer, the way Jim's prayer was his practice, the way Dale's carving was his meeting. Same discipline, different doors.

Beyond the perimeter, four hundred yards out, the rooted held their line. A dark forest of grey-green figures at the edge of the frequency's reach, motionless, connected, the root network threading between them like the wiring of a vast and patient brain. Not swaying anymore — growing. The colony watched the campus with the patience of something that was already everywhere and had nothing but time.

The rooted were there. We were here. The hum between us was the world as it was. Four hundred yards and shrinking — that was the space where everything that mattered would happen.

I opened the notebook to the last page. I'd found a new one — a composition book from the campus bookstore, black and white marbled cover, the kind I'd used in school a lifetime ago. The old notebook sat beside me, wrinkled and stained, its pages full. The new one was blank. Both of them were mine.

I picked up the pen.

**JOURNAL ENTRY #21:**

*I survived. Not because I was brave or strong or smart. I survived because I was slow, and I was scared, and I paid attention. That's not a hero's story. The world doesn't need hero stories anymore. It needs notes.*

*Here are my notes.*

*I'm going to keep writing them until I run out of things to learn or until I turn, and I don't plan on doing either.*

*Tomorrow we're going to try to reach the group south of here — the twelve survivors who responded to the broadcast. Dr. Moss says there might be a whole network. Sienna says she's coming. Marcus is fixing the truck. Jim says he'll pray for us, which I think means his heart is getting worse and he's not telling anyone, and I think means he knows I know, and I think means we're both carrying that knowledge and neither of us is ready to set it down.*

*Dale is teaching recovery workshops to people who never thought they'd need recovery skills. Ruth is building something in the library that she won't describe. Maria is counting, always counting, because counting is how she loves us. Caleb has a wooden geodesic dome for his animal zoo and he says the animals live there because it's the safest shape. He's seven and he's right.*

*I miss my mom. I'm going to miss her for the rest of my life. However long that is.*

*She used to say "Happy Friday" every week when she left for her shift. I used to barely look up from my screen. I'd give anything to not look up from my screen one more time.*

*But I'm still here. We're still here. And tomorrow we walk again.*

I closed the journal. The new notebook, first entry, the ink still drying.

Below, Sienna finished her laps. She looked up at the roof. I looked down. Four stories and six weeks and everything that had happened between us.

She waved.

I waved back.

Then I went downstairs to help Marcus with the truck. I didn't know anything about trucks. I'd learn.
