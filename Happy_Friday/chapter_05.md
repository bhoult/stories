# Chapter 5: The Playlist

Day three. Monday. I was supposed to be in Mrs. Tillman's class making a poster about the Louisiana Purchase with Braden Cooke. The thought arrived absurd and complete, like a receipt from a country that doesn't exist anymore.

My hand was swollen where I'd bitten it. Red-streaked, hot to the touch. I cleaned it with dish soap and wrapped it in a clean sock. *Brunner & Suddarth* said untreated bite wounds progress to cellulitis in 24-48 hours. I needed antibiotics. I needed a world that still had pharmacies.

I ate cold SpaghettiOs from the can and read more of the textbook. My hand throbbed. The fever made the words swim if I read too long, so I read in bursts — ten minutes on, ten minutes staring at the ceiling.

I kept coming back to the window. Seventeen occupied lots in the park. Some of those people were still alive — I'd seen curtains move, heard a toilet flush through the thin walls. Each of us hiding alone. Each of us running out of food alone. Each of us watching alone.

There's a concept in game theory called the prisoner's dilemma — I know about it from a 2 AM Wikipedia binge. Two prisoners, each deciding independently whether to cooperate or defect. If both cooperate, both get a decent outcome. If one defects while the other cooperates, the defector walks free and the cooperator gets the worst result. If both defect, both get a penalty.

The math is ugly. In a single round, the only rational move is to defect. Whatever the other player does, you're better off betraying. This is why it's a dilemma — rationality leads to a worse outcome than trust would. The thing that changes the math is repetition. In an *iterated* prisoner's dilemma — the same players, over and over — cooperation becomes viable because the future matters. The winning strategy is called tit-for-tat: cooperate first, then mirror whatever the other player does, and forgive quickly. Trust built on repetition. The long game rewarding the risk of the first move.

I was living inside the dilemma. Seventeen lots, seventeen prisoners, each making the calculation: risk contact or stay safe alone? In a single round — one encounter with a stranger — defecting is rational. But this wasn't a single round. We were all going to be here tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that, and the people who cooperated early would build the networks that kept them alive later, and the people who stayed hidden would run out of food and medicine and watch-hours and die rational and alone.

I couldn't solve it from the inside. I wrote it in the notebook and put a star next to it and the star didn't help.

I watched the park. The Turned had multiplied — eleven now, some familiar, some drifted in from Highway 21. They stood in a pattern that covered the exits: drive, gaps between trailers, the route to the road. A net.

Two of the newer arrivals moved differently from the originals. Pembrook and Lisa stood like statues — patient, still, conserving. These two were restless. They drifted between trailers with their heads moving, scanning, the posture of something searching for something specific. One of them stopped at the dumpster enclosure and pulled the lid up and went through it with a focus that wasn't the idle foraging I'd seen from Pembrook. This was directed. Purpose-driven. The body language of an organism running low on something it needed. I wrote it down and put a question mark next to it: *Different mode? Some of them are hungrier than others, or something else is driving the behavior.*

I started the list. At the top of a new page: **PLAYLIST.** Not because it was a playlist but because naming things makes them manageable.

Column one: name. Column two: what they were doing when they turned. Column three: behavior after.

Most entries said "unknown" in column two. I'd only witnessed one turning directly. But the pattern was there: everyone who turned was afraid. Everyone unafraid was untouched. Pastor Jim across Highway 21 walked between his house and the church every day and nothing happened to him. The variable wasn't location. It was something about the quality of his movement.

The textbook had given me the vocabulary. The observations had given me the pattern. What I didn't have was the threshold — the line between safe and gone. And I couldn't get it from a window.

Part of me was still waiting. I knew the bite theory was wrong. I knew they ate and maintained and weren't going to collapse. I thought the fear mechanism was the key. But underneath all of that there was still a fifteen-year-old kid who believed the adults were going to fix this. Somewhere out there, people with authority and resources were working the problem, and all I had to do was stay alive long enough. That was still the story. It was the last comfortable one I had.

I made my first mistake at 3:15 PM.

The laundry building had a flat roof with a maintenance ladder on the back. From up there I'd see the entire park — 360 degrees. Eighty feet of gravel between me and the ladder.

I watched the route for an hour. Two Turned visible, neither between me and the building. Clear path.

What I did not account for: a hundred and eighty pounds on gravel is not quiet.

Each step was a crunch. By twenty feet the Turned had oriented toward me. By thirty I saw a third one in the laundry building's shadow that I'd missed from the window. I should have turned back. I didn't, because I was fifteen and my ego was running my risk assessment.

I made it to the ladder. I was breathing hard — not the distance but the weight. My heart was hammering in my ears and I was sweating despite the cold. Three Turned were walking toward me. That steady two miles an hour. And they were making a sound — a low vibrating drone, resonant in the chest. A summoning call. *Come here. Something's happening.*

I ran. Gravel like gunshots under my feet. Knocked a propane tank — a clang like a bell. More of them appearing between trailers, drawn by the noise. I was a parade of panic, a hundred and eighty pounds of proof that the thing they respond to is exactly the thing I was producing.

I couldn't reach my trailer. Two between me and it. I veered toward Henderson's place, saw the gap between skirting and ground, and my body threw itself flat before my brain gave permission.

A hundred and eighty pounds of teenager diving for an eighteen-inch gap between vinyl skirting and gravel: the stomach hits first, because that's where the weight is. The impact compressed everything in my abdomen upward and I vomited — instantly, violently, the cold SpaghettiOs from six hours ago coming up in a hot rush across the dead leaves and my own forearms. I didn't stop moving. You can vomit and crawl simultaneously; I learned this the way I learn everything, by doing it wrong in real time. The skirting's raw edge caught my back as I scraped under — a vinyl lip with an aluminum rail behind it — and I felt it open the skin along my shoulder blade in a line that was either three inches or six inches long; I couldn't tell and it didn't matter because I was under the trailer and nothing else mattered.

Seven hours under Mr. Henderson's trailer.

Eighteen inches of clearance. Face in dead leaves and mud and my own vomit, which I'd crawled through and was now lying in. Can't roll over. Can't sit up. Every movement produced sound — the crinkle of leaves, the wet shift of mud, the scrape of my jacket against the trailer's underside. I learned to breathe without moving my chest, pulling air in shallow sips, because even the rise and fall of my ribs made the leaves rustle.

Through the lattice skirting I could see feet — bare, shoed, standing in a loose cluster. Four, then six, then more. The drone continued for the first hour, drawing them in.

At one point a face appeared at the gap in the skirting. Upside down. Someone bending to look. I pressed my face into the mud and stopped breathing and the face was there for ten seconds and then withdrew. They couldn't reach me. They didn't try to tear the skirting off. This was important data — in small numbers, they didn't dismantle structures. They herded, they waited, they applied pressure. But they didn't attack.

I stored this.

It got dark. Temperature dropped — low forties. Mud soaked through my clothes. I started shaking so hard my teeth rattled. Something wet was spreading across my back — the cut from the skirting, or condensation dripping from the trailer's underside, or both. I couldn't see it and I couldn't reach it and I couldn't tell if the warmth was blood or the cold was water and after a while I stopped trying to distinguish them. The ground under me was wet too — mud, certainly, but also something else, a sharper smell underneath the mud-smell, and I realized I was lying near what was probably a sewage line connection, and the wetness seeping through my shirt might be mud or might be something I was choosing not to name. My hand throbbed where I'd bitten it, the infection spreading its warmth into skin that was otherwise freezing, which was a horrible kind of irony — the only warm part of me was the part that was dying.

Sometime around hour three my thinking started to go sideways. Not panic — something quieter, more insidious. The cold and the dark and the immobility were doing something to my rational brain, loosening its grip. I started believing things I wanted to believe. Mom was fine — she'd locked herself in the supply closet at Johnson Regional, the one she'd pointed out to me once during a tour, the one with the deadbolt. She was in there right now with water and supplies and she was waiting for me. I was going to crawl out of here and walk home and she'd be there. The cavalry was coming. The National Guard was staging outside town, waiting for daylight. By morning there'd be Humvees on Highway 21 and people with bullhorns and someone would wrap me in a blanket. These weren't hopes. They were certainties — my brain manufacturing them with the same conviction it usually reserved for things I'd actually observed. The cold was killing my ability to tell the difference between what I wanted and what was real, and the things I wanted were flooding in through the gap.

I caught myself. Not completely — you can't completely override a hypothermic, terrified brain. But enough to recognize what was happening: my rationality was failing, and the failure felt like comfort, and the comfort was a trap. Your own mind offers you a story that feels better than the truth, and you take it because the truth is mud and cold and the sound of something chewing in the dark.

I held onto the data. The notebook entries. The observations. Pembrook's face. Lisa's scream. I held onto them like handholds and didn't let the comfortable lies wash them away.

But the cold did something I didn't expect. It killed the panic. As hypothermia crept in, the fear receded. Fear and cold compete for the same energy, and cold wins. By hour five my emotional range had narrowed to a single point: *survive this minute.* Just mud and cold and the need to keep shaking because shaking meant my body was still trying.

The Turned drifted away in ones and twos. By 2 AM the gravel was quiet.

I crawled out. My muscles had locked. Every movement was clarifying pain. My back burned where the skirting had cut me, and my arms were cross-hatched with scratches from the gravel and the lattice frame, and the vomit had dried in my hair and on my forearms. I walked back to my trailer — not ran, *walked* — through the gap between the dumpster enclosure and the back fence. The gravel crunched and I went slow enough that each step was a single small sound, and no heads turned.

Cold shower in the dark. The mud ran off in grey rivulets. The water over the cut on my back made me hiss through my teeth. Blood and dirt and things I didn't want to identify swirled down the drain. I sat on the shower floor and shook.

After, wrapped in every blanket I owned, sitting in the hallway with *Brunner & Suddarth* open on my knees, I wrote:

**JOURNAL ENTRY #1:**

*Don't go somewhere you haven't watched first. Don't assume empty means empty. Don't assume your body can do things it can't.*

*But the real thing: when I was frozen and couldn't panic, they lost interest. When I walked slow in the dark, they ignored me. The state of my body is the variable. Not the location. Not the proximity. The body.*

*Brunner & Suddarth chapter 6: "The stress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis." The HPA axis. Three organs that decide whether you live or die based on chemical signals you can't consciously control. I am fifteen years old and I am alive because hypothermia accidentally suppressed my HPA axis. The textbook calls this "cold-induced sympatholytic effect." I call it the worst night of my life, and I learned more from it than from everything else combined.*

*My hand is bad. I need antibiotics. I need someone who knows what they're doing. I need Mom.*
